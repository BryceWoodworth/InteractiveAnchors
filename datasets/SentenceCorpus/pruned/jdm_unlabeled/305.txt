et al evidence inference strategy
more levels less levels assumed associated
been obtained using wide range task settings dependent measures
yet decision rely
computer simulation two potential sources subjective validity
first shown perform above level when task strong population sample observations
second based based cell shown across samples
criterion validity random sampling error nature
introduction
accurate explain past control present predict future
adaptive perspective relationship between two variables population sample observations population
if task was evaluate relation between one two not may not
then sample more specific used decision used general population
example degree number was higher after than after one might general more than
not only number p example but most inference seems size sample value estimates population value
what might more quality information required
all require information about
other words every instance sample necessary know levels both variables
example every instance one whether had been whether was not
however due several factors e g delay between variables large amount variables considered information about might not available at time judgment use common
will discuss validity alternative strategy even under conditions
using greater numbers one level than other case variables sample base rates pair variables
using base rates do not require information about
however because base rates independent less why should used at all
while true at population level will show random sampling error population into sample base rates
sample base rates sampling process strong population
another strategies rely predictions across samples
