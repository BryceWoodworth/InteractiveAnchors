experimental social number number number how psychological distance moral judgment found more moral were given behaviors rather than behaviors
et al current paper evidence moral judgments become more at compared
four experiments using two different techniques levels their effects moral judgment
less moral less positive behaviors than
study was also between current results those et al possible different results between two studies discussed

recent work level theory provides framework potential moral judgment

instance found subjects were more likely describe events terms than terms means
under framework et al investigated how psychological distance moral judgment
paper they moral because their universal nature should moral judgment
since more represented at et al proposed people would more base their judgments behaviors moral but leading more moral judgments relative
consider instance between
perspective one without e g using might moral judgment less
therefore et al predicted observed greater psychological were associated more moral judgments
current et al findings more directly levels
findings effect psychological distance people's judgment decision making should not unique effect psychological distance per but rather more general process influence nature objects decisions
et al studies psychological did not test proposed effects levels first used more direct levels other research investigate how levels affect moral judgment
however observed more negative judgment moral et al findings
order robustness our findings another three experiments using different levels scenarios
consistent initial findings results suggest moral judgments more at than
given our results those et al understand basis our pattern findings
study study number present paper still observed results those et al also two our experiments subjects results were direction our findings but not
