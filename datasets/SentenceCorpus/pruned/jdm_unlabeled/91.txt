investigated extent human recognition compared samples recognition i standard samples typically very same samples about results
results four major show recognition well
were most other models when forecasting smaller small sample
however most cases
seems able recognition while at same time its lack among very recognition factors
yet seems simple people what population would instead whether they themselves also able
introduction
free you know who
did not only but also world
they usually rely generated large samples about their
instance potential typically asked they will
resulting responses used likely results
here investigate how far one much almost method does not require large samples
specifically test how well they before recognition allows forecasting outcomes major
compare performance small samples other forecasting methods including i large samples typically very method judgments many
article follows
first review previous research recognition allows making accurate many domains
second explain why recognition could accurate predictor variable forecasting why could particularly useful forecasting smaller
third introduce based
