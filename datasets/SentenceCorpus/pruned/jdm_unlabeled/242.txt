although many models risky choices between assume information recently proposed heuristic choices based one information only
although current choice according all other
however choices predicted other information often thus critical tests whether decisions actually based one only
current study problem number choice
results show choices decision times depend number thus notion decision making
introduction
adaptive decision use simple rules heuristics achieve very good results very little effort
since was been new heuristics introduced almost
despite more more new heuristics may become if they not tested p number adaptive was recently extended decisions means heuristic simple rule choices between
although idea adaptive decision making choice itself not novel new development area
et al both other heuristic models predicting participants choices
also they process model choice sequence taken decision cognitive
both been about properties more generally approach
one studies selection used choice predicted gamble other information often
thus rates choices studied et al might measures whether decisions based one only
current study problem
first choice rule will introduced along description problem information
