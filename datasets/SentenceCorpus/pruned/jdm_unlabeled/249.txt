study number number participants performed decision tasks either pairs two being each choices outcomes
tasks involved either gains losses small gains large losses
results both risk types social increased risky selection but its effect was condition
study number task was number study participants target individual choices individual
results showed others rather than being observed pattern increased risk taking
findings two studies importance different types risky situations findings literature
introduction
effect social environment individual decision making important because many individual behaviors presence others
area often studied field social learning focused situations individuals learn experience
studies field tend address situations where actions differ their objective value but information not among all individuals
therefore behavior important information about action
any empirical research field focused problem where main difference between alternatives their associated risk
another field study relevant current context study group behavior groups typically asked
studies group behavior question social influence risk taking
main finding research groups tend more risk than those their individual
finding typically group phenomenon
little research been individual risk taking decisions social context people able aspects each behavior situation social
research results
found choice task three individuals each outcomes risk taking compared choices made
experimental game found no effect social
findings also appear relevant applied studies
presence individuals was found increase risky task but only not yet more risky field studies
still findings usually research area often discussed group phenomenon observed decisions
goal current study effect social two types risk taking situations involving losses
one type cases gains losses likely
other type involves likelihood gains losses particularly small gains large losses
robust behavioral decision making when expected values similar people choose according alternative best outcomes most time
people more likely risky alternatives losses gains than those gains losses phenomenon indeed widely observed
yet note same principle predicts when risky alternative losses information behavior would increase risk taking
situation choice outcomes increase differences between outcome risky alternative typically outcome alternative
instance consider decision task alternative s number each risky alternative number number out number number
task payoffs option chosen
if individual then no additional evidence obtained outcome s number than number most time
social situation however others who take risk information decision thus likely increase level risk taking
results consistent hypothesis were reported studies examined effect feedback choice alternatives i e payoffs compared feedback selected ones only
decision tasks risky alternative negative outcomes common outcomes individuals provided payoffs presented outcomes alternative
indeed payoffs increase level risk taking tasks
however effect not been observed risky alternatives likely gains losses
latter pattern fact when risky alternative likely produce gains losses then its outcomes not better most time payoffs does not change fact
our main effect payoffs being choices outcomes decision task would increase risk taking tasks involving losses
two studies were examine prediction
study number effect other people's choices decision tasks involving losses
results showed while social increased risk taking both decision tasks had larger effect loss condition
