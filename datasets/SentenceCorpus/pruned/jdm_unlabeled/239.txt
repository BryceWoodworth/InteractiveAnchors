introduction
many behavioral individuals make choices first values objects then option value some noise
several questions how values decisions called decision values
how values compared
what properties those processes
questions increasing attention behavioral
particular several models how decision values compared been proposed
models based simple idea
decision value made prior actual value will derived
models assume decision values making estimates value then over time
some models empirical support both human behavioral experiments
models make some predictions important behavioral
example they predict decision value thus depend amount time
series experiments testing prediction showed items increases significantly time true items
extended class models investigate role visual attention binary choice
their model described next section makes two predictions about impact choice changes visual attention
predicts should possible increase probability chosen relative amount time subjects during decision-making process
second predicts effect should positive items negative items
paper results three behavioral experiments testing predictions
large extent results consistent predictions
properties value comparison processes should interest behavioral since they determine extent individuals able make quality choices they able do so
example results paper suggest variables affect visual attention conditions affect choices made
addition properties processes could important behavioral effects
our work related literature preference behavioral studied impact several variables decision values
example asked subjects make choices between pairs compared two conditions one larger payoffs were larger one smaller payoffs were larger
they found subjects were more choose gamble potentially larger payoffs first condition
common results outcomes larger size more attention lead relative those outcomes
related probability function theory biases place relative attention very low very high probability events result relative probabilities
all results what relative attention different choice problem e g probabilities gains
contrast paper show changes relative amount visual attention items also affect likelihood they chosen
thus our results do not depend one dimension choice being at another but model described next section process relative value comparison one option at other
our work also related literature effect
experiment shows about how much they like stimulus e g increased through previous items
there two important differences between processes studied paper
first about how previous affect actual experience whereas study how visual attention during process decision making choices made
thus whereas about impact learning across trials effect investigate about impact time within single decision
second whereas defined up positive result items even if they our effect more like effect positive items but negative ones
far know first experimental study impact decisions explicitly during process choice
experiment work et al who study role visual attention judgments about
