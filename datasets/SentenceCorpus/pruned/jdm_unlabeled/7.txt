introduction
major events natural influence our
major environmental event many people tend decisions
number had psychological impact many not only those were directly
number had high number area at time resulting over being
was therefore considered major
attention was many involved
event may also impact decisions
previous research judgment decision making shown preferences basis various factors people tend rely their reactions when making decisions
affect defined here specific quality state without positive negative quality stimulus
judgment decision making been described affect heuristic
most previous research affect decision making focused affect
however many judgments other sources affect also present
large number studies shows states target influence judgments decisions
example found affect i e state article risk judgments
however effect affect judgments not stable fact should rather seen process where individual determine if their reactions target relevant source information
at core notion when asked make judgment individuals information determine how they should make judgment
people tend use information available them at time making decision
other relevant more information people use their reactions target evaluate object
people positive tend evaluate objects more than participants negative
one important point here people their reaction target
information questions value reaction judgment
instance study participants were given simple about their no judgments
though was value reaction judgment task not reaction itself was affected
only one many sources information used judgments
experience information processing been shown important factor judgments decisions
study effect decision making participants were more likely choice when they generated more making choice
studies subjective processing found if makes impact perceived
thus seems subjective our thought processes their own
may further impact affect judgments
study showed effect specific risk perception
model research described following way number major environmental events natural may influence affect even among individuals not directly affected number affect will turn impact various cognitive judgments number effects affect judgment task information questions value judgments
specifically tested prediction affect about recent major natural would influence judgments future manner
previous research effects using scenarios
extended research affect through procedure participants were asked about recent relevant major environmental
our research strategy compared affect future events two groups participants one about control group
participants about would negative affect associated event
further affect would over judgments well
study number participants both conditions measure future future time perspective scale number their
scale was developed individual difference measure perceived time life
study number used scale dependent variable expected find individuals about perceived life more finite limited than participants control condition
study number participants condition were given additional experimental
participants then made risk estimates various future positive negative events
