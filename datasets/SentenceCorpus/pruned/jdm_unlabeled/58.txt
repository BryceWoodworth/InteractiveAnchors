introduction
decision researchers know about terms risk people will random events number
less known about how individuals risk when they their own decisions questions
researchers models decision making risky decisions based random events
much decision research perception research psychological events objective
number percent number percent clear objective criterion subjective may compared
free does not present clear criterion its associated probabilities
researchers difficulty performance relative criterion when task probability made free well relationships between relevant probabilities decisions
many others found people generally domain gains people probabilities possible outcomes known probabilities same outcomes not but same average value
major at very low probabilities where
domain losses preferences
effect special case
what probability making his next free
at his free rate was number number percent but his free rate was only number number percent
at his next free may game may
construct estimate probability example sample space free not defined
other words prediction performance variable over time task hence more difficult predict basis past performance
fact most state person change probability
existing evidence suggests task outcome effect probability decision making distinct
example control showed people when certain characteristics were example when were when participants were practice random mechanism similar
changes component changes responses
confidence were all affected control although control not robust
participants more when given being able choose whether more game but not when given choosing different
also participants high control more than those low control events over they had perceived control
those high control less than others events over they did not control
recent research two major role decision making control
important role component task decision making under uncertainty probability possible outcomes
control hypothesis people more when makes difference hypothesis same effect but only when individual relevant
control property task if task requires actions learned then characterized control even if not yet learned
other hand both task person exists only if task both learned task component been learned person component
people questions about knowledge they rather than
their studies participants either their answer general knowledge question random event whose probability their previously confidence payoffs each
across situations when questions domains times participants their knowledge was increasing function probability experiments number number
because confidence accuracy experiments random event whose probability was confidence was more likely than belief itself over random number percent loss expected
then experiment number tested hypothesis questions domains participants themselves either
they observed subjective probability constant participants consistent behavioral pattern domain were random events turn were domain
they people out domains but
presented hypothesis comparative hypothesis relative knowledge decisions most strongly when contrast between conditions greater decision attention
findings early findings random events when events component participants option at high probabilities but random option at low probabilities
however evidence specifically support control hypothesis remains limited experiment number comparing just two domains under selection techniques discussed at more length below
more recent studies risk knowledge against no at all rather than random event probability
knowledge items having average value if confidence was well
first two experiments increased confidence increased knowledge data obtained when using questions
experiment number one group considered their knowledge
other groups considered events random participants but every statistical way knowledge
participants more random events at low probabilities more their knowledge at high probabilities effect
important difference between studies questions single domain e g s history those use questions domains e g s history
differences between single domains low confidence items populations will include more questions domains
importance questions confidence
set general knowledge questions methods used decision generate confidence become because decision may using different reference set than
participants questions single domain allows more confidence across all questions asked
there control per decision making
major review literature people they high degree control they effort action they interest attention problem action
where control negative expected value might also learn new will result future positive value might therefore
made other even positive expected value might further information available decisions
argue characterized control even negative expected value might order set up decisions later
order increase does not apply when exists only when control increase
paper compare across domains people different order degree variation makes difference risk b findings made difference findings c compare control decisions under uncertainty
present experiments test hypothesis against control hypothesis decisions within domains difficulty among participants ability
between control most task particular little
control hypothesis suggests people more when could hypothesis only when been
best between two when could but not
control hypothesis suggests does decision making under conditions whereas hypothesis suggests does not
report three experiments use methods developed
basic task knowledge uses three questions two
first question type was choice question
prior studies questions domains
present studies selected questions domains
three question populations selected two number s states at random asked binary comparison one population area population density
other two question populations selected two number s comparison either population distance
second question type asked confidence each question one following percent percent percent percent percent percent percent
binary task one range number percent full range complete where accuracy would number percent confidence should not much higher knowledge where accuracy confidence both number percent
confidence was taken selected confidence
used risk taking across probabilities greater
range all binary choices being simple although also clear probability
studies confidence methods without those used
third question type each answer was given
participants out point were not
all conditions participants choice between certain outcome
was always having average value certain option if confidence judgment was
its average value was less than certain option if was greater than certain option if was
after feedback including correct answer question number points including if no points were point total
used two gains losses gains only
was used order structure many contain either gain loss
gains only was used complexity value gains losses
designed both provide average outcomes were if was good
were always between subjects were constant within experiment so no needed between both
certain option was no change points provided gain number points if answer was correct loss number confidence number confidence points if answer was
example if was number percent answer then considered number points if answer was correct but loss number number number number points if answer was
if did not gain any points
gains only structure certain option was gain number points
gain number confidence points if answer was correct no gain if answer was
so if answer had number percent confidence number number number points if answer was correct but if answer was
number points if
show average outcome either certain option no change gain number points gains only if confidence less than certain option if confidence greater than certain option if confidence
experiments number number participants two groups whether they they were their knowledge random event
group their using either gains only different experiments
random all statistical properties constant only rely random events rather than
many knowledge determined responses distribution subjective probabilities determined confidence frequency determined accuracy any order effects
random responses rule out any other alternative based statistical properties responses participants condition
stochastic fact confidence knowledge questions
phase each answer was into random event probability confidence corresponding answer corresponding answer determined outcome
example if expressed number percent confidence answer first question then first phase number will chosen at random between number number chosen number must less than number
number time number
if chosen number less than number you gain number points
if chosen number greater than number you number points
if if answer corresponding question was correct if answer was
number gain if was whether was each confidence expressed corresponding answer first phase whether was correct
all experiments participants research at them
participants more than one present experiments any additional related experiments
participants groups up three individual computer
data analysis if they did not use more than three confidence if they showed evidence not task i e over
participants were number out number experiment number number out number experiment number number out number experiment number
