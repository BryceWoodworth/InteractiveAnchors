current paper investigate how feedback over decision outcomes may affect future decisions
experimental study demonstrate if people feedback over outcomes they obtained outcomes outcomes they would obtained had they outcomes they become decisions
effect not only observed when feedback regret outcomes being higher than outcomes but even when feedback no regret outcomes being outcomes
findings suggest effect decisions at least due comparison prior choice
introduction
regret negative experience most us would
comparing obtained decision outcome outcomes might been had one chosen
research regret shown regret regret many our decisions
although literature regret between regret regret does between two sense experience current regret may affect future regret
notion found regret more risk
more specifically people high probability low payoff options over low probability high payoff options
also context decision making et al showed regret over first decision decisions
similar showed regret different
studies effect regret decisions was sense example regret specific was found affect same similar
more recently however found effects regret might even decisions other domains
their study regret over risky decision affected decisions choice setting
after gamble participants who learned they could obtained higher outcomes had they i e had they another gamble showed time preference
time preference does not comparison between outcomes not related gamble thus different domain than one participants regret
so how should explain findings
effects regret choice most would after experience regret learn they should not their thus change their behavior i e
would consistent most models regulation more specifically regret regulation
effects regret however terms learning may not
after all after regret risky setting does not directly one making same strong time preference
note however even specific effects regret one could process not specific regret over decisions but rather more nature regret over
experience regret may decision future regret increase their regret
rather than they do not make same decision may they do not experience same negative
was et al
do not been previous research
however do attention additional yet more general process may result experience regret experience regret may lead comparative
one characteristics regret results comparing what what could been
when obtained outcomes what after making choice compare outcomes one could obtained will experience regret
comparing decision outcomes therefore essential experience regret if you compare you regret
current paper attention making comparison
particular suggest fact making comparative judgments about decision outcomes may comparative may decisions
recently demonstrated effect series studies decisions
example one their experiments they presented participants one out four types
choose one one compare
consistent their comparative idea one increased if previously they had task them compare each other e g comparing
other words comparative task over task
more general terms p number described comparative influence behaviors decisions other situations comparison processes might into play
here suggest experience regret dependent comparison what what could been may comparative comparative influence decision-making
investigate designed experiment participants made two decisions
first presented participants decision task they would would not experience regret
presented them different task matching task they had two options terms
regret first task participants were presented situation they obtained low outcomes learned they would obtained higher outcomes had they chosen
investigate idea least part effects regret may comparative also several alternative
some presented our participants same low outcomes but did not them outcomes they could obtained had they chosen
conditions participants thus obtained low outcomes but could not compare their outcomes what could been
comparison decision outcomes people could therefore not regret their decision
consistent who key identification regret factor decision making under uncertainty hypothesis may whether not
predicted phenomenon should
indeed studies up found decision most likely regret when feedback
another condition however did participants about outcome they would obtained had they chosen but them outcome would same outcome
note condition because condition too participants would experience no regret but would now result similar comparison process case there regret also results comparison what what could been
experimental us investigate our general comparative versus more specific learning regret sensitivity prior research
if effects regret decisions would result specific experience regret should find effects would observed only condition regret
