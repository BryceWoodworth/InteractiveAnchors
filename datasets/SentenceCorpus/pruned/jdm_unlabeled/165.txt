research relationship between positive negative decision process choosing well chosen among
sample number decision process different decision life including decisions
overall participants showed low process choosing compared their other decision tasks
however more decision process showed greater their decision their when they had more positive perception
perception represented higher subjective likelihood long view between current expected
introduction
studies demonstrated people show low process choosing expressed their process
result they tend choice show decision-making making decision
found most people given very little thought even when they just few years
empirical people's heuristics biases their decisions
they show people make changes strategies when their
addition they rely tend
people than more more cost especially increase
more likely experience because they greater financial rely after they
therefore important understand lack process choosing well find ways increase
one people's low might most people simply do not knowledge information presented them
they do not know how evaluate choices make decision based alternatives
when given option most people choose suggested people may use make decision issue even when may not best them
when people large number options more options they given less likely they choice task especially when alternatives seen relatively similar they not able understand among them
lack relevant knowledge understanding may major low decision processes
other hand if lack knowledge main people's low interest would who do knowledge understanding real make best decision their future
above assumption behavioral decision research suggests even required knowledge people might not according rational models different options their relevant attributes
like people also heuristics biases
moreover when choice task complex many objects when objects relatively similar some their attributes tendency use strategies increases
heuristics emotional reactions towards task might also affect decisions both people
specifically perception towards concept may affect decision task
affect information hypothesis suggests judgments affected positive negative towards decision target other people objects well words etc

positive negative decision task might directly affect decision process
negative towards might result negative future at time decisions financial health
may may not
et al found showed even greater about than
indeed results suggest people who experience less likely future
addition since people see their their every expected only future they might their greater than future
suggest people may experience loss aversion their decisions being losses
negative may people's decision increasing heuristics biases decision process
some people may they would not their many years therefore might only little gain
people same objective life who they will their time expected more positive towards their
their about their future well their evaluation expected more positive means more money
positive more people may decision process may produce better chosen
positive negative concept likely emotional reactions decision task at time decision therefore expected influence decision process
low decision process may lead search information set option other may lead decision decision best interest
suggest two main factors may subjective first subjective likelihood at least number years
decisions may different people who will allow them their standard future people same expected
people who likelihood their many years higher expected more about not having financial means their since experience need more real them
therefore people more likely make show greater their decision
note use terms all through paper subjective evaluation likelihood at least number years rather than general
second between gains losses might represent positive perception when people future would greater than current future negative perception if
decisions would greater people who positive view one both above factors
people expected more involved decision process larger number alternatives before choosing more information about chosen
