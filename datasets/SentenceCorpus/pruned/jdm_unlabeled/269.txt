introduction
makes no sense you money will
yet many people do they make will
having people thus they should even though not their would not
similar people may their because they would their prior were
tendency prior called cost
more general terms cost tendency money effort time been made
people use further many decisions decision one decision research development
effect not behavior decision making but many other decisions including policy making
instance one important was who
cost thus many decisions very highly all people most important
above clear people likely become cost
however one could whether all people likely effect
some people more past than others
differences been demonstrated research state versus action
people typically over negative events focus taking action solve them while people typically find difficult negative event about how their current state
seems highly relevant question whether people differ their cost
although prior like may not seen negative events they may become negative if they not current future outcomes i e if their value
question then how state people those how much they let their decisions affected prior
our people more affected prior
argue more people more they see current decisions previous between two events
more people more likely they focus future what they achieve between current decisions previous
support research more people more they past related decisions they
respect cost compared people people more previous when about current hence they more likely show cost
predictions particularly relation prior action literature
there assumption often made increases likelihood
moreover against nature people
at first present hypothesis seems at predicts
however argue studies sense people expected more than people they take action solve situation
thus case leads prediction more people more likely they they
people more likely than people
order examine presented participants standard cost decision presence cost was
related their action measure was at
expected find cost effects people than people
