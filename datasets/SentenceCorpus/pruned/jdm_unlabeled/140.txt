choice previously been shown effects decisions about
number options increases people more likely making active choice i e show less any actually made
choosing
issue important because number impact decision may greater than decisions terms time
study number asked examine real how many they considered decision difficulty whether not they would like up chosen decision
study number presented either relatively small number large number choice set measured likelihood decision difficulty
both studies more options considered greater likelihood
effect was decision difficulty
research first find effects choice
discussed
introduction
place value choice
choice ability individual preferences outcomes associated people tend when choice
however choice need considered potential
research suggests instance too much choice may choice well reduction chosen options
moreover theory long options become more similar next best alternative also
between more options but finding them difficult been choice
however much research focused decision making still know very little about whether choice exists more decisions
aim current research was investigate whether choice decision making respect potentially more decision context choosing
time without financial gain time many individuals been range greater life health development better well others
individual potentially much larger than many previously
like many however one where choice
example number number
moreover social research research estimates number number
current increased at its
if indeed could major effect other similar
understanding how people make decisions about how best structure choices people's decision making could therefore policy
research into very important population investigate
life when many people first time
instance number percent first more than number number total each through at their higher number
key include learn new number number percent gain experience their future
estimated number number
also tend after
us were more likely number number percent than people without experience number number percent were also more likely still later life
present studies focus potential choice increase likelihood individuals will making decision instead decision later
given general not decisions could important
our primary hypothesis was number considered potential increases likelihood they will state preference decision will also increase
study number subjects were asked explore one main choose they would most like
between number options considered likelihood was then tested
study number presented subjects either large relatively small choice set preferences were
our secondary hypothesis was difficulty lack confidence during decision process might effect
