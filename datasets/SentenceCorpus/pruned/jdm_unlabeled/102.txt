according bias time when increasing low time when increasing relatively high
previous research used specific type task were asked estimate time when increasing give response show
present research two studies multiple questions show bias occurs other tasks
study number found bias when asked estimate time when increasing b distance at given time when increasing c required complete given distance times
study number showed no major differences time compared time also between responses given scale versus visual scale
study number tested two possible bias heuristic differences heuristic
some evidence was found use latter
introduction
if you need complete number how much time would take at mean number
most people would find answer question number at number number
but what if you increase order reduce time
how much time would you if you increase number number number
many people give questions
several studies shown people time when increasing relatively low time when increasing relatively high
