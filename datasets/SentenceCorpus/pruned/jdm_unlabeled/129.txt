introduction
et al presented new evidence people differ their general time decision making process
individuals preference find best possible option information about many alternatives possible before making choice
individuals preference contrast tend consider more limited range alternatives finding option given i e option considered good
et al propose differences preference versus may stable
some individuals whereas other individuals across wide range decision making tasks domains
particularly finding et al several studies despite their find best possible option appear regret their decisions more often than
studies also also tend experience more compared
findings other studies may represent predictor whether not person change his initial decisions
example one study were found change their decisions significantly more often than if given do so
findings also order rely more high quality than
decision stability change high potential wide decision making domains example search development choice
many us their base rates number per many
associated decisions still not well
although there increased individual differences affect behaviors very little known about how why differ
et al work therefore potential research individual differences behavior choice
main present study investigate whether relevant i e whether not less more one another
