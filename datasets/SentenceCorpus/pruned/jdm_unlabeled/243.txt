using disease problem effect each provide preference full decision problem also provide each component i e option risky option
consistent previous research more risky choices were made decision problems than those
however different processes were those high low
whereas choices less showed large effect above any influence their options choices highly were almost their options
results consistent increased tendency highly complex information their preferences tendency less more sources information
introduction
introduction disease problem was among examples human decision making
at problem choice between option risky option expected value
because current study will components disease problem now describe components
option fixed outcome
positive condition number out number whereas negative condition number will
risky option all no positive condition no one will all will negative condition
response choice problem decision choose option over risky option when potential outcomes gains but choose risky option over option when exact same objective outcomes losses
later phenomenon other domains money rather than did not always preference but general preference more risky choices losses than achieve gains one most findings judgment decision making research
later research task characteristics individual difference factors effect
present study one factor
aim current study effect into its component examine effect important variable defined ability understand probabilistic mathematical
asked participants each condition full also both component risky component
way extent full effect components compare individuals variable known associated more more complex processing information decisions
