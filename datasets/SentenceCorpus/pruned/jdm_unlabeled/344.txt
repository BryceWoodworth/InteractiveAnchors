series three experiments participants made about one pair two objects higher criterion
first experiment was designed contrast prediction probabilistic model theory sampling procedure effect
experiment support prediction particular pair sets would differ correct but observation participants performed well between s many they did not even than between about they much more recognition heuristic
experiment number was second time difficulty sampling procedure
experiment number knowledge recognition each was how often could used make inference was
choices were consistent recognition heuristic about number percent cases when people had no additional knowledge about about number percent when they had knowledge
frequency heuristic could used affected correct mean confidence predicted
size reference class was also effects important ways
introduction
history many many made when researchers
recognition heuristic just one example was finding was observed while test specific prediction theory probabilistic models
while other series special many given how recognition heuristic was how much research present paper three studies were number early number
paper follows first part provides context recognition heuristic
at part theory given
experiment number then reported was address one theory sampling procedure difficulty
specifically compared over two sets were generated same sampling procedure but were differ respect correct
finding participants performed about same when making between when making between s
experiment number second time difficulty sampling procedure order answer question experiment number
second part also experiment number provides best knowledge first empirical test recognition heuristic
was designed find out whether results obtained experiment number could participants having used recognition heuristic
experiment knowledge recognition each was how often could used make inference was
also criterion turn size reference class were when
