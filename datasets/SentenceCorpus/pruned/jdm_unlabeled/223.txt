many other cases interaction positive negative negative does not positive domain
also present evidence between importance aversion but do not account effects

introduction
people often about their example their family
may through evolution
but people also about relevant their group rather than their own person family
may considered two distinct ways place specific particular space more type larger some defined
place history years whereas space much more recent

states developed define were

strong been studied
central role many current including
states very give up even if people who
fact three very few cases up number

at least some people even consider potential also been described involving values

based contact always contact
when two objects physical contact they between them basic properties each other
process present only people now universal part
effects typically physical contact
effects represented at least two ways
one physical processes
other physical processes
negative much more common more than positive
many people do not show positive whereas shows negative
furthermore individuals who experience both combination two e g almost results strong negative outcome
when group particular area years one their into
could form base based positive
other hand if was some time if was there could strong negative effect
may one cases where positive may negative at least there many examples world groups very they was but been
study explore relation between measures
also consider some other aspects including its relationship about importance aversion
examine both states
there been important studies particularly perspective history
central particular both
many cases group

there evidence many particular sites hence values
although do not part they often strong about
major support like many other understanding degree nature type understanding
