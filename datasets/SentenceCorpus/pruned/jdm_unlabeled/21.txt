research determine decision results
due different used validity judgments made using
different approaches characterized two judgments
paper literature between two judgment
evaluation involves impact decision there objective values
evaluation involves degree decisions subjective value systems preferences
exist
therefore many results two unique
argue one approach cannot other researchers should not value either approach
furthermore suggest future research include both
introduction
number field judgment decision making taken two distinct those two used evaluation judgments
judgments compared objective goal empirical accuracy judgments
contrast consistency judgments
framework judgments degree they similar solutions given mathematical statistical theories
judgments not compared true value instead judgments compared rule often mathematical nature
