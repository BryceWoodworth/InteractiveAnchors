introduction
model one behavioral
model increased attention over years several
first provided more accurate accuracy reaction time data than alternative models wide range psychological tasks including tasks
second model special case many its its
finally model been applied explain data various tasks
important open problem behavioral how brain values make simple choices
problem particularly because there evidence comparison process not does not always choose best option
decision making lead several groups same computational model might used brain make simple value based choices
type choice situations brain among several possible stimuli associated different reward values at e g alternative items value every under comparing values one them
paper extent explain accuracy reaction time data real simple choices
subjects made real choices between pairs had they selected
task similar previous experiments human subjects had two stimuli was
key difference our experiment our subjects made choices between stimuli associated different levels reward at instance choice
whether both types tasks described same computational model because given large degree brain there no same algorithms would used reward domains
compare four different number free parameters they contain whether constant time up decision making
since best model likely depend decisions made out model two different time experimental conditions allow us identify aspects any changes performance
found popular version model account data both high low time conditions
furthermore also found changes associated introduction time could changes two key model parameters noise process
understanding conditions under explain behavioral data simple value based choice important several
first necessary first step extent model account underlying neural
second since been shown provide accurate description data other domains finding also provides good computational description choices provides into nature some basic algorithms might at work many different psychological processes
best our knowledge performance not been tested before choice although been tested other
fact best our knowledge provided accurate quantitative key aspects data every domain been applied
example been tested human using random motion task
few studies ability models related explain various common choice patterns
example several studies ability decision field theory account patterns choice settings choices among but not provided full experimental test against data
other studies investigated ability model similar
although previous studies shown relatively simple computational models decision-making account some behavioral literature their full properties simple value based choice not been investigated
