introduction
significant past research been understand people's differences their behaviors often differences risk
according expected utility theory theory risk utility function
model risk risk aversion risk assumed
based single view risk researchers various methods measure
some studies require participants choose between then compare observed choices choices predicted expected value
using probability method developed choice probability choice combined into single risk
according studies were due two major problems
people may risk risk depending method measure risk
even same method may individual into different groups across different situations domains
problems suggest those measurements do not predictive validity across range situations
given many risk measurements recently some researchers risk should framework risky choice manner
models assume risk taking between perceived risk expected risk taking preference expected b perceived risk c where effect expected risk taking preference b effect perceived risk risk taking preference c error term
researchers found group differences perceived risk expected risky behaviors
people's relatively stable across situations groups
therefore differences perceived risk expected risky choices play major part observed risk
risk framework et al developed scale order both risk risk taking i e risk taking preference formula above domains social health decisions
risk defined people's level risk taking defined risky behavior function its perceived risk
therefore scale measures both risk their perceived risk expected making possible study relationship between risk taking risk perception thus
using scale et al demonstrated degree risk taking across domains differences were associated differences perceived risk expected risky behaviors rather than differences
results provided strong support model risky choice
researchers provided strong evidence validity
et al reported its initial properties including estimates construct validity validity respect social
been many other
scale not been tested
above items domains were developed s since differences exist between there need examine its properties
therefore order further examine validity current paper scale using
process differences risk taking function then discuss possible observed differences
specifically two studies address
will our version scale
study number identify factor structure using procedure
moreover examined
also performed regression examine relationship between risk perception risk behavior
above framework various perceived risk expected
however because constraints expected could not present study
thus risk perception risk
study number order provide further empirical support factor structure factor analysis
