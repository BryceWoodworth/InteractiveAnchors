introduction
many people's through so those terms
despite many known biases occur when value people good not usually directly available e g health
much literature most method any question validity through single
early values using question perspective obtain use values e g how much would you

values without point value without using search help determine value
simply asked give value
however researchers validity because responses high number values because responses high values part due bias
response s number both experience suggest responses questions will
since then researchers using developed three types
no series questions value
all three methods however
game bias changes depending value used method range bias changes depending range values presented
choice studies using approach very because all being requires larger sample size more design analysis techniques
addition several biases including where tendency amount presented
choice was derived increase statistical
however even responses people who report high level about their exhibit significant increase uncertainty increases
further
despite strong against using some researchers do not call
although different produce different responses not clear
recent study comparing


would most present context


appear s


though health having long since given way
does not introduce range biases highly efficient compared choice
also several clear however
may place cognitive
fact other were developed part make more
furthermore terms using requires using response scale scale at but no defined end highly variable responses typically seen
addition people may more likely give values scale may treatment high intrinsic social value thus very high value not actually form
may give low response influence actual
could more but still approach might some problems above
specifically financial two potential
first measure will use response scale more efficient scale measure
generally people their preference health effect using scale at but no clear maximum amount scale
second involve smaller numbers scale versus number maximum people process smaller whole numbers more
one study found measure more significant associations key independent variables number taken than did expressed
current study was compare values financial values using
predicted method would less responses would more differences across health states would show more properties
asked based financial rather than because many people would consider power other financial condition they
about out basis rather than single smaller proposed likely more because many people their basis
could reduced when rather than considered
thus also introduced second dimension against compare versus single amount
current study studies study several ways
first introduce measure sensitivity
second compare effects using single amount
third focus specifically properties responses further more efficient measure
finally current study larger sample general instead patients
