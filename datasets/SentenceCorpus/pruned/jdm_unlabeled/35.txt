study directly tests hypothesis at least within domains judgment more do history object processes its
individuals rate natural same first natural some part then second natural part
original natural yet much less natural less
original only its history processes
also less natural than even though original natural latter not
therefore depends
introduction
natural seems generally improve perception applied
may what described experience human environment
natural generally considered more more than corresponding alternatives
most domain but natural preference other including some cases environments
natural may universal almost universal some domains
there direct evidence its domain
example states free associations natural almost positive
there been some attention related natural risk
much been genetic particularly
perception been identified number research much based risk provided
studies attributes description account much variation response there some based fundamental about nature
focus literature been health there been appropriate value decision making understanding relevant
there also been interest more natural world might predict individuals most
there two types natural preference
specific natural they more environment
type been focus most past research
natural better moral
found although usually their natural preference terms when example particular comparison natural natural preference usually remains
when their many natural just better
analysis properties concept natural suggests relatively like natural changes physical state
other hand changes changes
when natural its could result change process
there process may more important than change
involves major changes less than change single gene another
example only less natural than whereas single gene variety species effect
gene process involves direct genome but change much more effect than much larger change both genome
idea process more important than judgments further evidence
comparison not out previous research involves changes only involve process only
although not possible change but does not involve process possible action processes but no change
if natural natural then same its natural form
same natural then having
study explore judgments similarity one set addition then then addition
