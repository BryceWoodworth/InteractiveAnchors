several approaches judgment decision making properties heuristics
one example recognition heuristic judgments made one single cue recognition other information
our research conditions under more useful thus more often
propose fast whereas more
because thus much more important when processing information should more often situations
two participants either use through model
results revealed both experiments use was more likely when judgments were made rather than
potential application heuristics not processing
rather their features most when more
introduction
heuristics reduce effort
indeed without processing effort information search there would little need cues difficulty cue values cues less information all heuristic strategies
following work most approaches judgment decision making heuristic processing specifically its properties though there some whether heuristics generally less accurate than complex strategies
however despite many would heuristics judgments decisions one way another
how does heuristic processing concept
answer question literature one must first characteristics
like many others define fast based prior experience
moreover usually involve integration multiple information manner
processes little no individuals multiple their decisions way
finally typically processes
involves two distinct processing systems one another p number
note however not clear whether actually represent two different rather end points same dimension
if one two basic one central heuristics their properties b more than thus less following seems will increase need heuristic processing
heuristics should much more when judgments decisions performed manner under conditions
situation heuristics may significantly without leading reduced accuracy
however will information integration makes
note hypothesis need not different so long more less than more our should
above our view should actually reduce heuristics not literature
indeed some considered heuristic processing sense result though they also strategy
also although mechanisms rather than heuristics used without
latter case each provides potential mechanism
seems heuristics his adaptive approach mechanisms information
rules only few information p number
however heuristics approach other related per make strong about extent use heuristics
theoretical seems open question
heuristics often been past
contrast propose clear difference between heuristics especially those part adaptive above characterized integration multiple information
heuristics contrast information
indeed previous empirical findings consistent our
example showed individuals complex information within short time
more processes rather than first risky choices using cognitive test showed more characterized more heuristic search processes
proposed choice heuristics result more cognitive processes e g but become when responses generated e g
other studies directly revealed heuristics more likely applied rather than judgments
example participants increased heuristic
contrast those answer their object rather than experimentally provided
similar results been reported frequency judgments predictions judgments
