much research field judgment decision making focused either c c order understand findings field one understand differences between two
about judgments decisions will depend upon selection criterion
first i provide terms c c theories them field
second i provide example literature base rate
third i examine field
i suggest c c needed
specifically c c number more applied than researchers number should include two important types number third theory
class defined goal
order provide most complete human judgment possible understand different findings field all three should considered
introduction
there two main researchers field judgment decision making who each different human judgments decisions
according researchers tend judgment while researchers heuristics biases b program tend
about judgments decisions will depend upon selection criterion
understanding important field human judgment cannot cannot current without our role
strong focus paper evaluation
first i provide history terms c c theories they
second i provide example some literature base rate
third i examine field
i suggest c c needed
specifically i point out there two important types third theory needed complete framework
