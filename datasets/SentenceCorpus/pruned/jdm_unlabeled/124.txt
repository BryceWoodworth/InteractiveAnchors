used model examine effects response time accuracy data two experiments involving decision making task
asked number subjects low high number number number based decision
model evidence either low high decision criterion turn response
performed two experiments four experimental conditions
conditions number number decision between low high judgments was fixed at number
condition number frequency low were presented
condition number used payoff structures frequency
found stimulus frequency larger effect accuracy than did payoff structure
model found stimulus frequency produced greater changes point evidence process than did payoff structure
conditions number number set decision at number number number experiment number at number number experiment number
condition number there was number low whereas condition number there were low
model analyses showed changes biases produced changes stimulus whereas evidence biases changes decision
introduction
well known experimental decision making tasks produce changes behavioral responses subjects
experimental example observed subjects bias their responses based probability stimulus
models been used describe predict response bias tasks
models typically decision process information over time towards decision threshold
aim study was use one models examine what processes account biases tasks produced stimulus frequency payoffs decision i e point at stimuli one versus other response
stimulus frequency well known response times stimuli appear more often than stimuli shown less often
addition accuracy increased less more stimuli
example used task subjects one two corresponding
there were trials each was trials one was number percent trials other number percent trials were
comparison likely condition response times were trials more often trials less often
effects payoff also been interest cognitive
example used payoff matrices allow subjects at end
subjects always one point each correct fast response but points based one following structures one they point correct responses one point fast responses one point responses two they one point correct responses point fast responses one point responses
found subjects either made more errors more made errors order not too many points
more recently response biases payoffs motion task multiple reward four reward conditions
two tested showed performance reward conditions but performance i e response increased response probability response conditions
our present study stimulus frequency payoffs typically reported literature but novel direct comparison two answer whether effect observed both accuracy due changes stimulus frequency similar effect due changes reward values
moreover comparison less studied decision
