research identified loss aversion strong robust phenomenon but also revealed some its effect decision making
current article attention fact even loss aversion itself may affect its focus either losses gains
three studies provide empirical evidence focus
all studies used there number number gain loss measure loss aversion
participants either out loss gain gain loss
studies showed within real loss aversion versus loss increased loss aversion
moreover loss aversion was more affected gamble than
introduction
when making decisions consider potential outcomes thus consider potential losses gains may occur
example when consider potential losses should potential gains should up
when making when people directly compare potential losses often give more weight losses
larger weight given negative outcomes generally loss aversion i e losses larger than gains
addition decisions loss aversion been used explain many effects observed context decision making cost effect bias effect
although existence loss aversion there still work better its
example researchers generally assume potential gains need large potential losses
they introduced loss aversion g gains losses makes even gain g just
they observed gain loss number number number their experiments gains average need large losses make even gain g
current paper however will argue show loss aversion not constant but fact how measured
show number when people focus gains compared loss but increases when people focus losses compared gain
