current field study time preferences similar but two very different environments one more than other
control group about their time preferences
during where they uncertainty about future high risk measured probability
much environment tested performance only
show relatively high subjective rates when compared other two groups
suggest higher subjective rate among result high perceived risk higher risk
introduction
subjective rate rate at individuals current value future outcome
rate person person depending each
general individual who values present more than future will higher subjective rate than person who more value future
current paper examine how time preference
compare time time high
since its number state had universal all upon high at number
two three years then
important part population
unique group because they at prior their similar very low
their total all life individuals under its dependent upon very clear values
tested first basic training
usually work higher
they much environment tested performance only
few studies tested decision making compare them
studied choices early us
were choose
recent article et al compared decision found high levels correlated behavior
other studies our study first test time preferences who did not choice but rather were
order similar test conditions other distributed both groups when they were
found higher subjective rate when compared similar groups
paper follows section number discuss risk their relation our research
section number hypothesis
section number experimental design
section number results time preferences
