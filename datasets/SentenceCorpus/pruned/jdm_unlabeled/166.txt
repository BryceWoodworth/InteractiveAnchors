examine how almost behavior
our main finding behavior some less likely numbers were prior other more likely numbers
using unique data set game model likelihood number while number bias likelihood number being
also find no evidence leads time more
introduction
events occur wide variety domains including natural
depending upon domain there
within literature special goal one close being p number close being p number was close p number
some term more description event under but term
context suggest event considered if outcome but if outcome could p number paper they outcomes critical role
central belief associated one almost but almost but
uses term
almost was close one

importance events they affect decisions made each event
example there experimental evidence lead play
early research showed subjects high first two three machine gamble but result could not under different experimental conditions
however studies found experimental evidence machine games lead more games increased time
although most research effect focused machine some research examined effect other games
found subjects game outcomes both when they were close number when they were close number
another study et al found losses close effect difference values between increased
while both studies found effect machine games studies was they were not designed study how affect behavior
also affect decision making
domain provide evidence often lead make decisions
specifically provide experimental evidence who make decisions result highly who make decisions result higher than those who without
further evidence suggests who experience events but do not experience will then probability future lower than objective probability leading choose alternatives
domain natural provide evidence if then subjects were less likely
subjects were also less likely had past without
result people did not given probabilities they did not new probabilities they simply about initial probabilities were given
thus might information changes people's reference p number
