introduction
how good you at
how good you at people's
judgments people make about their own cognitive one person another
judgments about also relative judgments made others about us
often more than others better than what our actual performance
observations might people learn improve at most cognitive tasks
learning occurs not only at task better at also at become more just how good at
examples several aspects what known cognitive knowledge people about their own cognitive including about their own performance specific tasks
some judgment secondary actual performance
according view knowledge required perform tasks certain domain also required ability domain
one view judgment person who good at at understanding how others will relatively his good memory but relatively his
despite its view been judgment level performance
because subjective estimates performance correlated actual performance judgments performance will mean participants who perform given domain will tend their ability domain while those best will tend
other words relation between actual performance subjective judgment may statistical rather than relation between cognitive levels
although about own norm biases often
reduced loss all terms same phenomenon own
populations provide test judgment certain become affected disease while others relatively
thus possible whether judgments become only affected domains judgments domains
answer question so far been
consistent hypothesis some studies reported cases patients who their but other domains
there also evidence
example study type factor analysis data revealed two independent factors cognitive related length disease cognitive behavioral related behavioral emotional
contrast other studies reported findings consistent errors specific domain
example patients been reported their performance not only memory but also tasks
furthermore seems more strongly than memory problems despite latter being more
although setting may help us understand not long research had experimentally based literature judgment
recently experimental become better researchers rely more experimental
experimental useful comparing judgments their performance their actual performance task
furthermore predict performance before task estimate after task possible i e whether judgment after task
experimental applied domains other than one primary
feature important when testing domain judgment
populations our study patients behavioral patients early type
although its close cases brain case
patients often described their take other people's into account when how
they often exhibit social behavior changes decision making
at early disease many patients having about them
been social emotional domains but further domains relatively performance
contrast patients early their social relatively
memory
at early patients tend their but disease
after report two experiments examined whether patients their performance relative patients
judgments performance were obtained attention task experiment number task perception task experiment number change task
testing two different domains attention perception early were able test judgments
