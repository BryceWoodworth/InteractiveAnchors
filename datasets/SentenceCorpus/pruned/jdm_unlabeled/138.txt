studies choice decision making among real rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common real life
when rewards large they almost always
results situations important know extent choices among rewards choices among real rewards whether variation rewards behavior ways
present study compared real rewards two experiments
experiment number participants temporal game game versus choice one alternative reward choice other alternative larger reward following
reward was greater groups than other
rewards also type across groups real
all groups significantly increased choice larger reward over number trials experiment
over number trials was significantly higher when difference between larger smaller rewards was greater
reward type real made no significant difference most measures
experiment number real rewards were compared social value reward social distance increases reward
social rates were well described function
rates real rewards did not significantly differ
results evidence results experiments rewards apply life
introduction
research choice using rewards participants asked choose they would if alternative rewards were real
research participants task
one potential problem using questions psychological research participants may not required
people often cannot predict what they will do certain situations may will not at
but then may well
even if asked his behavior at past may not how much
task involving degree behavior game where participants asked how much initial they give another no small amount even might would give more money when than would if money were real
participants they rewards
because characteristics some been validity choices among rewards
decision experiments found real rewards than rewards
most prior studies experiment number present study compared large real rewards directly large rewards
they studied all positive negative b small large rewards c real rewards
they found strong effects reward expected but choices participants who gamble did not differ choices participants real money
moreover studies comparing delay real rewards found both reward types functions find significant differences depending type reward
although find does not itself mean there no differences existence significant differences delay well real rewards when other variables been increases confidence choices
example found strong number between degree choices real rewards one selected outcome actually given
whether not rewards effects similar those real rewards important issue studies decision choice
if effects real rewards similar then rewards may over wide number participants will not
example reward value amount reward but directly amount probabilistic reward
probabilistic rewards et al study number number number would been study real rewards
but more evidence experimental participants choose between real rewards more confidence there will participants among larger rewards how they would choose if rewards were real
experiment number compared real rewards type game versus
number shows matrix used experiment number
number person game b each choose between c d
each reward determined combination both choices
case number number number number reward matrix number will number number number number reward depending number possible choice chosen
if both each high reward number if both each low reward number but if one other very low reward number while very high reward number
strategy called been found increase games
if n b will n number if n b will n number
when b number number when b only number number
thus choice number more when b than when b
but if b only way b will if previously
present up number but will gain number next when b
strategy thus problem smaller gain number versus larger gain number next
if b must choose lower two rewards present order b turn allows choose between higher rewards next
number b shows average reward function percent b
strategy very always number per
since behavior determined place may taken experimental was experiment number
prior experiments number number number number matrix versus participants learned over trials
number number number number matrix where reward was number learned higher than number number number number matrix where reward was number
delay time between trials increases its probability
computer game experiment number versus but did there was another b making independent choices
versus game participants had choose lower two available rewards present number rather than number number rather than number order able choose between pair higher rewards number number rather than number number next
given number versus game number been found delay function number delay functions been found not significantly different real rewards expected type reward real versus would effect no effect present experiment
whether would affected increasing all rewards factor number number number number number number would depend whether function difference rewards
choice experiments humans reward rather than differences situations
thus expected would not significantly affected increasing all rewards
however did increasing only reward while reward constant matrix number number number number number number number number would increase significantly
game experiment number social game where alternatives maximization versus maximization another
own future other changes game situation
experiment number studied true social choice
participants between larger rewards another person smaller rewards themselves
both experiments tested versus real rewards
