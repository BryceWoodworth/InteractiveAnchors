compare four different measures their ability describe predict actual risky behavior domain health
measures compare number general measure derived question number risk aversion set number measure risk taking derived behavioral risk task number likelihood health domain risk taking scale
study participants number health
our findings suggest general measure best predictor risky health behavior our population predicting two out four behaviors at number percent level two behaviors at number percent level
health domain well predicting one out four behaviors at number percent level two out four behaviors at number percent level but only if contains similar actual risky behavior being predicted
behavioral task were actual health behaviors they were predict any risky health behaviors at number percent level
provide evidence not because participants had understanding questions performed behavioral task
researchers further test general measure both health related behavior other
introduction
risk taking part life but people differ their
some people risky while others
developed various methods measure
paper four different types measures tests how well they predict risk taking health domain problem risky behavior
first measure called measure paper was developed et al
using one question directly about how do you see
you generally person who take do you taking
scale where value number means at all take value number means take
while simple measure been subject two
first domain
generally behavior domain specific possible individuals show different levels depending context
thus measure being general measure may not able predict risk taking health domain example
et al who showed general measure robust predictor behavior different domains including behavior health domain
second measure its lack
issue general about measures work more more when money performance
case people's usually choices between them what they choose
because question does not provide answer may their
instance question found resulting distribution differ significantly found et al
authors not having was between measures found but authors also related including lack risk main
second measure called measure paper was developed
most common measure literature
makes choices between where each choice between risky gamble where high low payoffs number number our study gamble where high low payoffs number number
probability high low payoff risky gamble same probability high low payoff gamble
probability number number number number number sets choices
when probability high payoff high at number number high up number under risky option number under option case only very risk would choose option
point at option risky option used risk aversion
because one choice pairs selected real after made all number choices about before making any choices measure
because measure derived using whether measure derived domain related risky health behavior
question not been widely studied
using sample almost number number s found measure associated only at number percent level
using sample about number found measure use
third measure used paper behavioral risk task performed computer
task number trials
each
computer makes number per
every different level before does not know number made before any
at any point during each money computer makes
if however its level money
at end task all money
task measures actual individual
because feedback given after each either when money noise if decisions made psychological state
decisions contrast made psychological state because actual task revealed after all choices been made
et al use term risk taking describe term risk taking describe task similar
been shown associated psychological measures risk taking behavioral including drug use risk taking etc

however good predictor health related risk taking not consistent finding literature
et al found was measures related risk taking
found towards risky
et al found did not greater risk taking than
found was any measures examined
our measure uses version domain specific risk taking scale developed et al
about likelihood various but risky each domains financial health social then into
contrast measure single global
domain been shown associated risk taking within same domain
instance et al found had significantly higher health domain than comparison group
found health significantly predicted
current study examine measures population at health test how measures health risk taking terms risky
our study makes few
work et al testing how measure predicting behavior other than
test ability tasks health domain using task may interest other researchers about understanding risk task
