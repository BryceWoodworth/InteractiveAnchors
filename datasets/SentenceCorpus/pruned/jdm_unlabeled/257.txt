despite research risk communication little known about social choices
showed learn numerical probability estimates function average larger group payoffs
result effect group size better communication
basis social theory small groups less among their than do large groups when new tasks therefore small groups will learn better communication more
result obtained experiment number compared groups size number groups size number number
test whether social rather than social was effects experiment number compared social feedback group size constant at number
learning was feedback condition social rather than results
introduction
focus research understand some factors affect how choose risk information others their groups
suggested group selected their communication manner best their group whole but authors only at effects
research investigate effects some but important variables use probabilistic estimates specifically effect group size social comparison
et al designed experiment individuals their own their
et al asked whether would behavior decision function what best their group
example become when work at same time
when
however some cases behavior may
example some when they all same
whether learned choose behavior et al designed study two different payoff conditions
one group payoff when two group making decisions group made same correct choice other condition payoff when at least one made correct choice
addition possible group individual when they were correct
authors assumed number make choices they their number individuals differ greater degree than numerical probabilities
basis authors predicted would learn give judgments when behavior best their interest would make different choices depending their terms numerical judgments when behavior best group all would make same most likely choice
fact how data out
finding suggests do learn their communication response group payoffs
