one major behavioral decision research identify cognitive processes underlying judgment decision making
compared previous methods process models more tested choices decision times confidence judgments
maximum likelihood strategy classification method was developed statistical data analysis
present article describe free data analysis under general provide practical application
also provide function
thus prior knowledge not necessary those using
introduction
been individuals make adaptive use different decision strategies application strategy might depend different factors characteristics effort accuracy learning
some strategies might based
others contrast might rely processes
showed process methods might information search processes necessary processes
furthermore taking into account processes many strategies make same choice predictions
showed strategies make different choice predictions people more maximum likelihood strategy classification method compared strategy classification
furthermore method also allows us between strategies make same choice predictions given decision time predictions
experiment generate data application method three basic number choose dependent measures distributions those measures number choose set strategies number items between considered strategies derive predictions dependent measures
then predictions strategies empirical data using strategy most likely behavior identified
provided method data analysis
