when rate quality life associated health condition they must not only evaluate health condition itself but must also scale order specific value
way approach task depends subjective resulting results across populations tasks
particular patients often give very different health conditions questions about either
study found perspective i e their own current health relative health conditions they way they between different health states
consistent theory disease were disease patients whose own health between two scenarios whereas whose own health was better than both scenarios two scenarios much more similar
addition found context task way participants between scenarios
both patients less distinct two scenarios when each were presented than when they were presented other scenarios provided information about possible range disease
results about validity subjective highly differences between groups task
introduction
who disease
only during physical activity three
scale number number what quality life like
how does quality life compare more who even state
health may find difficult up health description like
first person much than second but how much
how different would their quality life number points number number
specific numbers may arbitrary
order rate health conditions must not only evaluate how good condition they must then how evaluation into specific value scale
because tasks subject individual specific values given health state may depend who task much researchers policy make sense results
uncertainty health differences often observed between health conditions
patients typically rate their condition higher than so often focus either patients their health condition
however between may actually more complex perspective differences than under health conditions either group
theory suggests reference point critical how given state
gains losses become more they effect utility
case health small changes health should produce relatively change quality life smaller impact larger changes health
because patients different reference point they should different same health condition
case disease case same disease would represent gain health whereas case disease would represent loss health cost
contrast person full health no disease both cases disease would represent loss health
because increasing losses impact case would larger cost than more case
number gain loss theory predicts patients may actually give conditions patients should greater difference between health conditions than do
if so may too patients health condition another issue may health state may depend task context
when single items no context about how alternatives tend give scale either unknown future items
however when multiple items tend items across scale using items themselves scale
strategies suggest people may more relative position items than specific values associated scale
hypothesis suggests may particularly when relevant attributes judgment difficult evaluate
task multiple items allows take relative into account when values each
rather than items lack more information use relative comparison between items how place items scale
study at how patients rate health conditions differ
asked disease patients evaluate quality life several scenarios different levels disease
based theory predicted patients should not higher than all disease scenarios
rather predicted because most position between most scenarios they should wide between two scenarios
because view both scenarios loss they should much smaller between them
difference between scenarios should larger patients than
addition study at effect context both
some our participants only single disease condition called no context condition because no information was provided about relative compared other possible cases
other participants multiple scenarios presented together each different level
term context condition because task each within context relative other cases
predicted items no context condition should scale relatively small differences between scenarios
contrast items context condition should more distinct greater difference between conditions
also predicted greater effect context patients than
their own experience patients should some context task
patients more likely know about possible range than do
even when context not provided explicitly task patients would able information make those their own effect information provided context condition
