using stochastic approach about number number subjects show based belief play role practice
furthermore find when both positive negative available much effect than latter
results using tests
introduction
many studies examined role their effect behavior individuals
study interest effect behavior sense they increase individual performance
practice two types ones ones
paper second group
previous studies effects behavior
were first propose test theoretical model
they using model
among other results they found major
using several out states they provided empirical support their theory
et al developed model where financial both current
they show play important role financial
studied relationship between
found individuals who place higher probability existence more
recently number et al estimated role
using they found but more much more relevant than positive than negative ones
however regression approach does not allow us study effect positive negative
when model contains interactions among variables two problems appear i effects estimate effects not
showed et al estimated interaction terms do not interaction effect moreover their statistical cannot tested through simple
even more given estimated interaction effect also current value other independent variables
hence cannot study different interactions regression model
paper different statistical stochastic approach allows use effect positive negative
our analyses main results showed number et al effects among positive negative
way show play role performance comparing not only positive negative but combination both compared
study was out people
strategies lead
two versus
while also social activity more
using stochastic approach whether increase whether belief more less than effort
