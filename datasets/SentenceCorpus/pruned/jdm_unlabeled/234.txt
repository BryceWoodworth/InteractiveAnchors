regret important risky decision making however only few studies its role problem
study tested differences regret among social problem examined how differences affect risk preferences task
extent problem was using participants were one two conditions
risky feedback condition regret was risky gamble whereas feedback condition gamble was option
problem was associated choice risky gamble both conditions less sensitivity regret
was also associated risk across feedback conditions when were higher
findings suggest less regret regret might thus need cognitive problem
introduction
cognitive been identified research literature key factor problem
studies shown cognitive biases control bias lead about outcome probabilities
resulting possible losses individuals place more risky
about probabilities risk taking may also affected associated outcomes
role well literature decision making regret particular attention
however relatively few studies examined regret context
investigated number introduced found number percent were because they regret if their numbers up
increased number percent those who same set numbers
study showed regret people expected if they not play their had significantly their future
effects regret number found did not predict
although all three studies examine relationship between regret their results do not allow about regret
due fact studies participants problems making how many them actually problem
present study examined role regret problem two
first estimated effect preference regret
previous research suggested although common among all types more cognitive more more their than social
recent study showed were less able regret than regret possible factor
participants were asked choose outcomes how they would they learn outcome their decision
later same participants were asked play same real actual losses rate their regret
reported difference between actual regret was significantly larger compared
findings suggest when do not negative regret they might experience they learn outcome their they more
contrast regret about outcomes could natural continuous
evidence number studies found regret risky potentially behaviors
recent study showed individuals more regret than they had turn made them more risk task
present study relationship between regret preferences choice between two one outcome selected option only feedback other outcome both selected options complete feedback
was preference would associated regret would thus result more choice gamble feedback
second goal study was effect preferences risk
previous studies demonstrated problem exhibit higher risk taking than normal subjects because they cognitive biases make risky more because they their
was risk associated preference would towards risk due lower levels regret
following et al two experimental conditions were each complete feedback option
risky feedback condition feedback was associated risky gamble whereas feedback condition option was gamble
i preference would regret thus preference feedback would lead risk risk aversion depending feedback condition
contrast preference would related risk expected feedback
moreover i examined risk preferences low high variation outcome probabilities test robustness results respect different involved
