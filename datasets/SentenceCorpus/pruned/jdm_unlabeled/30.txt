across many domains more risky behaviors than do
examine some preferences difference number participants their likelihood various risky four different domains health social reported their number probability negative outcomes number potential negative outcomes number expected risky
greater perceived likelihood negative outcomes their lower risky choices health domains
potential outcomes was health domains
did not differ their towards taking social
domain associated high potential payoffs fixed was also
contrast other domains reported being more likely behaviors domain
difference was more judgments probability good outcomes outcomes being more positive
introduction
very particularly among s disease control more often than
example every number number us three times likely involved
while some difference rates differences average amount time seems likely another important risky behaviors more often than do
example us report usually using more often than been shown more often than
furthermore similar differences seen wide variety other statistics
involved about number percent more often than much more often world
thus there seems little must more risky behaviors across range domains
despite its practical importance some key aspects psychological differences risk taking not been examined
present article new sample report various preferences related wide range scenarios
existence differences take been large number experimental studies
example over number differences risk perception
they literature participants more likely take than participants p number
recent work examine cognitive differences greater
one important study provides present perceived behaviors different domains financial health social decisions
differences were found four decision-making being less risk greater likelihood risky behaviors
similar differences been found domains large sample
across studies social domain unique either no differences found when they found who report greater risky behaviors overall greater less risk so
interest authors also found risk across domains risk taking not simply some general risk
instead individual group differences due risk different domains
most part previous research notion risk e g how risky behavior situation

number researchers examined role various affect overall
several psychological risk including control knowledge perceived
research shown well emotional factors also impact overall risk judgments
any global perceived risk elements belief how likely will
subjective outcome how would

thus common given behavior might than another behavior if more potential if higher risk potential negative both
example could both described risky behaviors yet probabilities potential outcomes different two cases
past research shows elements important individual group differences responses risky situations
had subjects outcomes associated defined probability e g number percent loss
different groups were probability against
present article similar approach explore different risky
note field where distribution potential outcomes continuous risk often choice
following approach some found useful people's risk preferences terms how choose option
while seems many real world risky choice scenarios e g without not using etc
would view potential negative outcomes event having probability some degree
approach will here although general will point out potential work would consider involving more than single negative outcome
literature does not contain any studies risk involved risky behaviors order determine whether differ their negative outcomes
number present themselves
one hypothesis do not evaluate probability negative outcomes than they simply assume not they would more negative outcomes should occur
one may greater probability outcomes without any negative reactions outcomes than do
while studies effects risk not issue there one study within literature question
examined differences involved physical risk taking
using e g no determine how they found more general risk i e situations more than
also factors their overall risk judgments
risk judgments were significantly predicted their while risk judgments were better predicted their any type
suggests may risky situations any likelihood perceived may risky situations only if possible perceived being
above literature not examined whether differ their number likelihood potential negative outcomes number their potential outcomes
either both aspects risk may differences risky behaviors
third factor may also differences risky behaviors may differ their estimates activity negative outcomes do not take place
some support et al et al number who found relative they would obtain greater risky behaviors all domains social
using framework suggested risky decision making seen between risk expected
present study had two major
first was differences three just
simple terms present study do tend example less often because they likelihood greater b they were occur would greater c because they simply do not find positive aspects do
addition examined whether depending upon domain behavior compared patterns risk perception risky behaviors past
second aim was explore important choices taking not our knowledge been examined previous studies individual differences risk decisions not behaviors small probability large positive reward some small but certain cost
example number order large money
type will positive domain
one possible why risky they relatively themselves relatively i e experience least possible outcome more often than would expected based overall
if so then should also show less interest than options low probability positive reward
another see outcomes whether good more likely occur cases they should show greater choices positive domain
