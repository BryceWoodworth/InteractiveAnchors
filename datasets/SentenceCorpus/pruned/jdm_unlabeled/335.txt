recognition heuristic simple forecasting heuristic fact people's recognition knowledge their predicts game
present two studies predictive power recognition forecasting games analyze previously results
performance recognition heuristic compared two predictions based
across three two predictions based recognition performed similar those based when compared heuristic well
based not recognition information
discuss use recognition forecasting across individual
introduction
events world more popular than before
example number number over number total
how should make about events
many different approaches been proposed
one common various individual information about past outcomes then predict game e g number number game outcomes based knowledge
knowledge about seems accurate
indeed seems assume one predict will if one does not even know most his
one
there evidence individual exists
instance recent study number how often they were number better than
one among several examples predictive power simple heuristics knowledge
fact simple forecasting mechanisms even more ones no means new
finding however been not widely use not yet made into popular example see
one may less information time one uses less accurate judgments will
one few general human seen
domain forecasting events indeed difficult what simple forecasting strategies more complex ones simply because data
recent review there need test relative performance heuristics complex forecasting methods more over years rather than few arbitrary p number
predictive power recognition paper literature four ways
first two new studies predictive power recognition forecasting games
two studies will show what extent previous results
second predictive power recognition two studies previously research against two all predictions based e g
third investigate whether based recognition information
investigate performance heuristic recognition individual rather than e g instead itself
but not least let us our recognition domain should not taken mean power recognition domain
