introduction
several studies compared patterns subjects different mechanisms
despite theoretical among various mechanisms mechanism empirical studies suggest behavior mechanisms may

effect exist if their true utility
previous evidence existence effect been

provided evidence results effect
addition et al show patterns
current study impact effect effect patterns different risky different
particular study examined patterns both two mechanism environment mechanism environment
consider two types
involve very high outcome associated small probability low outcome associated high probability
previous studies did not between two mechanisms
study examine two types since expected find differences between them patterns
no impact effect position since loss very high will not
addition effect position will out since who very high outcome will
evaluate considered several psychological effects influence patterns individuals
effects impact each effects all them expected among mechanisms
literature does not discuss possible interaction between psychological effects environment effect
our study interaction effects
psychological effects loss aversion effect been used explain
yet recent studies existence possible between
et al first both trials though mechanism
et al suggested may depend mechanism
effect potential outcome potential regret outcome may between
current study use not only but also us examine more between
current study two types risky versus mechanisms items two mechanisms
study also influence interaction between effect other psychological effects patterns
results should some impact effect pattern different different comparison
