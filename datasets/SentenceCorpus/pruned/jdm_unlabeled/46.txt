researchers decision making usually analyze multiple decisions within experiments choices across individuals using individual subject analysis
approach important patterns within data
specifically decisions across task game possible characteristics subject experiment

our results task game ways analysis test not possible other techniques more more likely theoretical models
introduction
experiments within decision making involve subjects making multiple decisions either different groups decisions learning task
analyses data typically involve how rewards related characteristics experiment individuals involved
complex analyses relatively
approach at least one major
most studies involve multiple decisions each individual
each subject several decisions
possible individuals their decisions across play they
at average results decisions could important patterns within data
analyses do not allow examine ways characteristics participants experimental design affect decisions
other words analyses provide results but only decision-making dynamics within experiments
suggest data experiments form data sets they usually include multiple decisions within one more set conditions
models been specifically developed observation help us understand process dynamics decision making within our studies
paper describe model analyses them within between subject
then demonstrate use models decision making data data two previously
first study involves task multiple decisions individual response variety stimuli second involves games within person groups
finally describe wide range possible applications approach provide using models their use decision making research
although major aim paper utility method include used our analyses provide greater use method
model one there both between variables
above studies decision research literature often focus variables their analyses variables those affect decisions one individual makes
yet decisions often important
thus argue more natural analyze many decision making studies using model approach
addition models very wide variety experimental
design all subjects all treatment conditions
first number design there two different design elements b
design each subject s each condition design design b b
example would study showed preference based response choices
design one each subject only single condition there no variation
design second number where each subject s only one condition two design conditions b
other words between subjects design subjects within b each subject single observation dependent variable thus only single treatment condition
many decision making studies use design their data design across all decisions individual makes form
number then used dependent variable
researchers also use design involves measures conditions one more factors presented each subject variables set rewards study variables experimental conditions positive negative subjects do not variables
design design third part number b within subjects factor factor
term particularly there sources produced differences differences both types differences statistical analysis
design allows us differences at same time study relationships
design also allows us model decisions what called regression tendency individuals similar manner one decision another
researchers used models variety settings
much original work models was settings thus also models design
setting were often considered random each same set fixed experimental conditions one experimental variables while were within experimental conditions different experimental variable
contain at least one variable at least one variable
models used both often component changes over time component
used linear models examine influence characteristics individual
researchers used models examine growth changes characteristics variable different characteristics analysis
thus there wide variety methods close attention within between individual group variables
two widely used general modeling strategies linear models models
either allows modeling random variation individuals decisions within individuals
situations paper either linear modeling modeling approach used
suggest general approach applied decision making help researchers develop more accurate understanding elements decision making process lead outcomes
within many experiments given individual makes choices often across variety experimental settings
because individuals make multiple decisions decisions not independent
method data simply all decisions level individual any variation
practice however potential variation extent researchers impact experimental variables individual choice
also researchers analyses
use models provide both more yet more efficient method analysis
now utility models data two different studies
