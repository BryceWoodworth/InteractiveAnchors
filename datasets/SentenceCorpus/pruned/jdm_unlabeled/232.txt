introduction
do people particular their
if so what might basis
both questions been within field but not knowledge been subject empirical
paper them
set issue context first people generally not free recent results people many would see more rather than than exist at present
respect general at samples produced up
difference may well there been several why difference might
focus present paper do people developed particularly low low
if so why
before some why people might not note there at least two result
most likely
taking perspective people being able example but quality those made own
taking more perspective could seen more need than at
other hand there several possible why people might
three investigated here people losses result local higher having low understand principle comparative advantage people being
three were investigated because they related three about comparative advantage discussed
people might lower quality was not investigated but instead effects belief were studies
most even might their result
no means
although one how much rather than there no people their their
also losses people's
moreover there good empirical evidence people's increases if similar available own if at out although previous research not investigated effect levels
important note not only those whose affected but also others who their own
could considered body previous research situations individuals may but not their own those
although previous work leads us not clear should particularly if rather than one higher but still produce more
one most important greater results principle comparative advantage
very principle suggests where should most produced depends comparative advantage rather than advantage
need not most efficient any order
points out some people might generally because they principle comparative advantage
principle found both principle was people people lower understanding more
suggest common free only if strong up because
authors point out principle important because does not advantage good over some other might still comparative advantage
about because overall lower then lower good lower cost other
however because lower cost lower might seen people other
finally possible people might low because they who low
case would
whether not
point out what alternative
three studies reported below
first two studies feature research three different components factors scenarios
three factors whether under low high whether similar made at might level made
after each asked their preferences about
know whether preference other but effects also important why preference might
if there particularly strong preference when similar made at strong related at
if people because they would where make very large when
study number used different method examine relationship between people's preference test their understanding principle comparative advantage
first third studies small samples new second small sample
