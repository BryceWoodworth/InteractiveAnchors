three studies investigate how well information higher lower
study number number probability level higher lower number reference information no number subjective higher lower design
higher were probability level but not reference information
lower between higher lower probability when there was no reference information
study number about processing
higher was associated numbers graph
study number was experiment same design study number but rather than using reference information sequence task type first first explore role focus numerical information
lower between higher lower risk only when they were first condition
task sequence did not influence risk higher
our results suggest may useful higher lower
however groups process graph
higher rely more numerical information graph whereas lower when they towards numbers
introduction
patients often difficult decisions
many decisions made based numerical information
therefore important information
past research shown many people understanding numerical risk information low ability understand numbers especially numerical information
therefore not more more studies show low associated less understanding information decision outcomes
different solutions been proposed communication information
some authors suggest example numbers should expressed especially low graphs
one special type graph two risk communication because graph shows frequency information b numbers way
show number people affected certain condition larger group people
therefore type graph seems information low
several studies show help people low understand information
however although improve direct understanding presented numbers e g knowledge how many affected certain disease not yet clear how graph risk perception
influence risk perception however may because risk either high low might greater impact behavioral than understanding numerical information
generally lower risk than other perspective scale numerical
not possible whether reported risk perception correct one because subjective nature
difficulty one experiment investigate whether different levels probabilities different levels perceived risk
approach participants either higher lower probability then estimate their perceived risk
then analyze extent participants higher risk risk higher than participants lower risk
results two previous studies following procedure using showed higher probability did not higher level perceived risk than lower probability
result might suggest although some studies showed help low understand numbers graph may not help them risk same degree
thus type task used study may influence evaluation
role perception process our knowledge not yet
therefore three studies examine influence people's new approach question people's processing numerical information
examine issue context cancer test results some studies shown important area
defined ability understand process numerical
measured two different ways
objective measures people's them solve mathematical tasks
one problem using objective measures might use
would then bias resulting
furthermore might find thus might simply them when they do so
problem developed subjective scale
measure advantage less participants than objective measures
other hand measure numerical ability preference
moreover although correlated objective does not measure same construct direct mathematical objective measures
short aim our first study was examine influence subjective perception cancer test results presented
following approach experiment examine whether different levels probabilities different levels perceived risk
understanding into how might influence risk perception relation second study
directly examined processing cancer results its
finally study number role sequence task numerical understanding first risk perception first context risk communication
procedure aim existing knowledge about decisions role risk perception
