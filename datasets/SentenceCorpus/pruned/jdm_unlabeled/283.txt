quantitative information about patients e g probability was given form case visual scales
theory predicts not only but also objective themselves will processes support decision
after decision participants were asked objective about patients
results showed objective were used prior decision
process alternative less rather than more important
introduction
theory process theory human decision making
models decision making process involving different processes leading decision
according theory human decision structure both about decision alternatives when they make decision after decision
goal process sufficient support chosen alternative
example alternative make alternative even better when decision been
phase process decision when outcomes
theory process approach decision making number other models human decision making some were
empirical decision research shown time after time value evaluation value before after decision theories
chosen alternative value evidence alternative chosen alternative before after decision
however there lack empirical themselves
if decision given objective time e g number fact one alternative decision between two may change evaluation fact e g process making decision
evaluation does not mean quantitative representation must change
decision should able exact time e g number within random error even if there was no
when quantitative decision problem way support decision
introduced uses judgment approach some similarity present decision approach but focus outcome phase
other researchers following studied how memory prior quantitative probability judgments generated quantitative fact was after outcome knowledge
they found general quantitative were direction all before bias
studied memory chosen alternatives after decision alternatives described features
they found features positive were more often chosen alternative than alternative
was found negative features
when alternative was participants memory were less option than option was chosen
shows decision process had effect features
had their participants make treatment choices no treatment effects rate number percent
however since all patients different certain probability
uncertainty about probability fact was used choice
instead features probabilities present studies will investigate quantitative attributes find out if memory
present studies were designed test prediction
if hypothesis process will investigated
one example both chosen alternative
chosen alternative greater extent than alternative
new problem not been focused past since were focus not themselves
studies shown does not appear most important support choice
instead important attributes alternative
fact processes decision turn chosen alternative into after decision
was first reported later another context
do not but according predict no changes most important but changes other attributes particular changes alternative
also introduce visual scale way new decision process research
scale been used health measure other quantitative response scale
but present context will used give information about
according theory decision involving important processes
therefore will use difficult problem following empirical studies
predict number will quantitative support chosen alternative number quantitative will same pattern other attributes than most important particular attributes number through changes both chosen increasing support alternative support alternative
also number introduce presented scales
design will order control response regression effects true processes depending prior decision
first study participants use visual scale present case
second study first study group participants who problems
