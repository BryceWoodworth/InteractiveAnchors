natural frequency view predicts frequency errors while view predicts structure problem error problem
study tested predictions using task
previous studies frequency reduced errors reference class problem
after present findings show errors reduced using either probability frequency frequency effects depend upon presence reference class frequency do not better statistical than probability
introduction
evidence suggests information presented frequency rather than probability many cognitive biases found probabilistic
there evidence frequency advantage bayesian bias errors
although specific frequency effect task general natural frequency perspective statistical because computational algorithm
alternative well evidence frequency effect been
particular hypothesis suggests frequency effects may problem representation making structure thus
according hypothesis information way allows people relative problem structure key
occur whether not information presented probabilities so long critical structure made
example et al tested three problem first
probability version problem was follows frequency version problem was follows third problem version was probability version structure problem
was follows note all three problem specific reference class i e number provided
what different between problem however both frequency version probability version structure among critical those who test positive whether not they disease number number those who test positive disease number number
natural frequency hypothesis predicts only frequency problem version will bayesian result correct solution number number number percent
hypothesis predicts both frequency version probability version will correct because both make relationships among critical
et al findings support hypothesis
they found probability version significantly correct than did either frequency version probability version
latter two problem did not significantly differ number correct solutions they
et al similar study but frequency condition positive rate number percent was number number instead number number thus structure
further support hypothesis et al found both probability frequency problem significantly correct responses than did frequency version structure positive rate number number
results also consistent findings reported who similar
evidence hypothesis provided who presented bayesian problem frequency probability presence representation problem structure whose relative
found there was frequency effect
presence however there was no significant difference correct responses between frequency probability problem
evidence suggests bayesian problem representation frequency no additional advantage when problem structure task
bayesian almost no research hypothesis been other judgment biases frequency effects also been reported
evidence hypothesis tasks
only two examined frequency effects problem only one study provided direct test hypothesis problem
both reported frequency participants errors comparison probability
there was potential those studies however
reference class was given frequency version problem was probability version
those studies whether reduction errors direct result problem result information manner problem representation
consider two problem presented
both presented following information probability participants were asked rank order number about according their probability
among were two active their active
frequency participants were given same information but were asked how many number who like do following apply
note frequency frequency estimate provides specific reference class out make estimate
probability does not provide reference class judgment
similar studies reported
between response estimate rank reference class present clear findings
indeed reported significantly more errors probability response than probability estimation response
frequency effect found both studies could result response problem
effect frequency could also secondary participants reference class their attention within class rather than direct result problem frequency judgment
et al reported finding no significant differences between frequency probability problem when relationships between critical were made their
their finding suggests when structure problem frequency effect
finding consistent hypothesis
present study examine whether frequency effects after reference class research errors
