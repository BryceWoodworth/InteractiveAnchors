introduction
explain need model decision-making
understand how agents people need model strategies people e g when outcome situation depends also decisions others agents
thus understanding various interaction between indeed at large requires understanding how people payoff uncertainty when they each other
when decisions outcomes depend also decisions other people choice process quality each makes decisions context assumptions about decisions other but other may choose basis assumptions about decisions first
game theory concept pair decisions if would obtain higher expected utility making different decision given other decision fixed game theory notion
using experimental methods tested how assumptions found between actual predictions game theory
example any game both real life problem but people risk being
however many studies showed people game theoretical predictions i e people more than expected
there various some including factors game role play resulting communication so
more recently tested one basic assumptions game theory not typically experimental work each game considered resulting choice strategy should based only attributes current game
study presented psychological phenomenon game theories decision-making
specifically reported results people do not notion utility strategy game particular instead people's perceived utility strategy highly depends other recently games
experiments were based research fundamental cognitive processes related perception representation weight
note utility decision strategies games people must risk associated each strategy
respect had some factors determine how people might similar factors underlying
there evidence people at stable judgments other options presented them recent past available at time choice
context effects consistent people making judgments basis relative information rather than information
decision making games if representation game also similar representation simple i e similar underlying cognitive processes involved then might expected influence current judgments decisions games does case
tested whether attributes like measured like those stimuli they found similar context effects
here provide experiments essential understanding study presented article
various experiments conditions study participants games tested whether properties distribution like mean range rank would affect rate predicted other
experiment number tested theory
contrast predictions theory did not find contrast effects depending whether particular game above below mean i e adaptation level games above below mean were not perceived more less
instead condition higher mean more rather than less across all game types
effect mean simply assumption amount frequency observed participants independent game they
game including predict more games average would lead more feedback each more across all games
other words mean may observed effects
experiments number range difference between games along scale was while their constant
range presented games produced contrast effect so games were further minimum value sequence were perceived more
experiment number rank order between games along scale while their range differences constant found rank had significant impact prediction choice
same game presented high rank other games sequence condition produced significantly higher prediction than when same game had low rank
thus results experiments number number predictions about contrast range frequency theory according point judgment scale did not mean events but rather between defined range distribution
point thus distribution was affected rank particular stimulus distribution
example judgments would different two distributions different their quality levels hence will different rank stimuli even if means two distributions same
effects mean range rank distribution our effects due some general underlying cognitive mechanisms
one related perception particular representation discussed
second fundamental mechanism related response action because agents tend actions e g c d according average degree each action associated i e utility agent outcome game chosen strategy
psychological point view following effect degree they positive outcomes out degree they negative outcomes
example context will strategy higher payoff without about structure game other words follows more choice instead strategy
demonstrate when people make decisions two action related biases terms particular attributes games like depending environmental distribution
existing studies however investigated whether context effects also when against consistent
here do not mean rational who should
consistent mean whose responses determined current game not either structure previous games history past responses
thus consistent across
because consistent context they may potentially rather than effects experimental may if both human participants same factors hence potentially over due response biases
our study consistent was computer algorithm not human participants were although algorithm not
most natural model consistent probability depends game related each also related other if one
here use provides good measure level observed experimentally games
test described article important because measures power response biases will whether biases real where any
other words good when situation both would better if both but being additional other less you
was play participants had play against computer
setting computer was frequency probability values each game
example computer was number percent time when games number
alternative design would program computer i e number percent time
however design would not evidence about biases under question because computer generated feedback more about various games
thus will feedback signal when games less more various biases more likely environment
other policy according less about various games
note even if people they game i e they themselves program every time rather than different person each time should not affect our key because given program prior context then does not if game not
actually if game seen then should make effect consistent even should turn further context effects because would more likely their consistent
our research objective design three experiments described
particular variables were parameters statistical distribution games sequence mean range rank were experiments number number number
here present three studies together
