recent evidence suggests sequential context effects contrast found judgment tasks may present judgments
time series approach data developed applied judgments risk disease possible sequential context effects
results demonstrate sequential context effects do exist judgments
contrast were produced cue series latter more
also showed prior responses was independent cue series input
time series analysis also revealed large changes value cues most attention judgment tasks accuracy judgments
findings suggest time series approach useful alternative least regression additional into cognitive processes during judgment experiments
introduction
many judgment experiments may involving two time series series stimuli presented series responses provided subject
over years various theories human judgment been proposed
one all theories common they been being developed using measures experiments
whether judgment data using multiple regression judgment analysis often associated social judgment theory information integration theory analysis fast heuristics take best matching heuristic data obtained subject series stimuli series responses
analysis their data focus article
contrast psychological processes involving sequential context judgments made
variety judgment large numbers trials e g relative tasks relative identification tasks sequential context effects observed
occurs when response given stimulus larger when stimulus greater than current stimulus smaller when stimulus less than current stimulus
contrast occurs when response given stimulus smaller when stimulus greater than current stimulus larger when stimulus less than current stimulus
discuss various theoretical models judgment been proposed explain sequential context effects experiments show how using time series regression
one class models relative judgment models subject comparing value current stimulus value stimulus rather than some fixed reference
et al discuss relative judgment models identification tasks
another class models suggests sequential context effects result response heuristic tendency subject uncertainty direction his previous response
point sequential context effects may because representation current stimulus affected previous stimulus because tendency under uncertainty provide response based previous response
question whether similar sequential context effects judgment tasks
judgments estimate likelihood will future based current been studied judgment researchers multiple regression analysis
how sequential context effects might themselves let us examine what could single cue
example consider task risk disease cue question whether not
situation described if judgment risk lower when does not judgment risk without higher when
situation described contrast if judgment risk higher when does not judgment risk without lower when
judgment tasks observed response provided subject estimate associated given stimulus
judgment tasks where there not objective stimulus response provided subject may
judgment tasks observed response may estimate judgment along more subjective
asked whether contrast observed judgments would when people make estimates more
they examined estimates made series choice decisions i e games
their experiment random sequence number games produced greater mean differences rates number percent number percent when compared conditions number games number games number percent number percent number percent number percent
differences were using responses
authors significant interaction support local contrast effects
current article whether sequential context effects tasks but different theoretical approach
when sequential context effects associated cue judgment task observed they here mean influence represented its weight values cue over trials
means when cue values trials t t number different influence smaller than when cue values trials same
contrast means when cue values trials t t number different influence larger than when cue values trials same
although may consistent methods sequential context effects
example one way effects mean response stimulus value current function differences between stimulus value current
number example using data two who judgment task they estimated number risk based cues task will described below
here focus cue
each responses were allow direct comparison
subject number shows mean risk current prior
subject number shows contrast mean prior
each responses were also using multiple regression was number if present number if
number shows some results
first when responses all number trials were both subjects shows same size weights cue
when data according values cue trials see how weight each subject changes when contrast place
although regression analyses influence changes when contrast take place approach because its nature data two trials been
better approach would analyze data all trials
time series analysis used test sequential context effects series responses obtained single subject
specific models sequential context effects produced cue stimulus series those judgment response series
present article time series approach developed discussed context research judgment tasks
before discuss application time series analysis perspective position time series theory methods psychological research needed
next section provide perspective
following application presented possible sequential context effects judgments risk disease
