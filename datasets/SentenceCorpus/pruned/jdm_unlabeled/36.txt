some participants evaluate experience
others its overall evaluation questions

suggested represented over time i e time utility
experiments field studies shown people evaluate more increasing rather than time at levels total
there preference rates well experience
finally rule finding suggests overall best predicted only two experience most
present set assumptions about why integration all would correct point view
life researchers other hand explore alternative study role person overall
contrast previous research present work what decision themselves they about overall
i will compare what researchers considered
comparison may further theories overall suggest ways testing them
i novel method task order
