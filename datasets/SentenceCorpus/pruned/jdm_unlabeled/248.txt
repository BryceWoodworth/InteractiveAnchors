people tend emotional responses future events
study examined whether forecasting errors occur regret measured decision-making
some participants game wide while others were asked
participants who loss reported more regret than those who loss
furthermore those loss more task
thus study provides behavioral evidence forecasting phenomenon regret
introduction
people when decision rather choose than
if only were simple
one problem instead people outcome their decisions would
although people relatively at predicting how certain outcome will make them they less at predicting those
you will make you but will than you would
between been studied well natural settings under forecasting
study forecasting participants first report their general next some experimental procedure outcome
finally some participants asked predict how they would after particular outcome while others outcome first then asked report they experience
allows researchers measure extent level reported at
result participants their leads them how their will some time after outcome
example when asked how they would number after money task people predict more than they experience number after actually
people also their initial reaction
evidence over number years support basic finding people impact future events will their emotional response
most studies emotional response changes
example some studies asked participants report their scale not very
other studies asked participants report several different those were later into positive negative
dimension useful study forecasting
however approach also question whether bias dimension include biases when predicting specific
know people relatively at predicting specific e g etc
they will experience different situations
know less about how accurate people at predicting those specific
few studies examine question particularly regret
current study another step direction
regret defined negative based experience when our present situation would been better had
thus regret unique among its if i had chosen then would out better
when available regret seems more
example people's choices most when they choices those cases approach available
similar people they will experience more regret when outcome than when wide
loss
people number should more regret than
same over number years
loss highly effective at regret been recent study forecasting
setting people who reported no more regret than those who wide
result was contrast predictions people made when before
finding was experimental setting
new set participants was play game show
before game participants were asked report their emotional state at time including report their level regret
next people were asked rank several
participants had two their two best then choose best one
some participants were asked predict how much regret they would if they were find out correct was one they did not choose loss
condition experimentally situation asked having outcome e g
predictions condition were compared actual regret reported participants who actually loss
other participants were asked predict how much regret they would if they found out two was correct wide loss
authors study participants predicted they would more regret after but they did not
other words there was between amount regret amount regret
results were consistent theory forecasting empirical support over years
at same time some aspects experimental design findings
particular participants et al study were after being they had
small may participants loss thus amount regret
fact previous research shows people most negative events when them outcome their
thus might lead very different pattern results one experience regret than
our study tested hypothesis
another number study et al its measure
while approach been basic its use more complex regret
people directly report how much regret they people their
although some researchers indeed possible others argue direct regret other negative
furthermore measures subject possible effects when same often case studies forecasting
one way measures explore influence regret future behavior
some researchers general regret particular exist behaviors
many choices people make aim experience regret regret risk taking
our potential actions make us
thus risky behavior after loss should possible us whether loss more effective
task first introduced our participants after task
participants computer were good i e any them would per but one was i e choosing would loss every up point end game
following reported how many they would like turn
after initial number participants made second more important decision
they had whether money one more another
thus relatively small was against risk larger amount i e regret situation
using behavioral measures regret show experience regret larger than
