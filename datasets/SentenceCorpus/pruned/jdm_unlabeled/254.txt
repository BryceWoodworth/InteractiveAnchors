present study was investigate effect perceived time task called task
one participants were one two groups
experimental group was time was typically learn complete task
control group was time was typically sufficient learn complete task
both groups performance was
major finding was participants who were amount time was typically complete task performed significantly than those who were time was typically sufficient complete task
introduction
research shows real time constraints influence performance
there remains need however determine how perceived time decision-making
performance real time constraints simply perception time constraints
