introduction
more choice than before
previous research phenomenon focused almost having more versus less choice
contrast very few studies investigated preferences choice how much choice people actually
limited research area suggests while larger choice sets generally more there significant differences
preferences choice were found across decision domains groups even
although underlying mechanisms preferences choice not been evidence points key role decision-making
theory present research study number experimental approaches study number examine proposed between preferences choice
belief ability given task individuals more tasks more
two recent empirical work suggest confidence ability make effective decisions may affect preferences choice
first individuals higher versus lower decisions more complex more information when making decisions
latter effect been demonstrated across multiple domains choices selection decisions
since preferences complex decisions increased information information complexity part increased choice would also associated preferences larger choice sets
additional support notion finding individuals more choice when decisions relatively simple compared more theory generate high versus low levels
example individuals more likely larger versus smaller choice sets when there versus more attributes consider when alternatives present versus
one study involving decisions among demonstrated individuals larger when they assume options within will based their preferences i e most least versus not
similar individuals increased choice when their preferences highly
combination findings suggest individuals more choice when they able make effective decisions
although previous research consistent predictions derived theory between preferences choices best our been examined
address research two studies investigate role decision making
study number examined between measures preferences choice across multiple domains
study number effect experimental preferences choice complex decision outcomes
