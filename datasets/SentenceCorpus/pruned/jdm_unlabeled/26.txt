paper version original scale developed range levels
also provides scale
using modeling investigated relationship between risk taking risk perception number risk domains
results previously differences reported degree risk taking risk perception at mean level analysis
modeling shows more variation risk taking across number domains scale was about number times large variation
discuss our findings terms related risk stable
introduction
people differ way they decisions involving risk uncertainty differences often described differences risk
expected utility framework its including theory differences risk utility functions differ different explain risk aversion
risk parameter between utility functions different individuals more than utility function
popular risk however often consider
risk similar development general
while were defined stable i e characteristics were assumed result biological differences early empirical observation low between behavior different situations given more complex behavior while way pattern behavior across situations
following two observations been simple risk
first different methods people's utility functions thus risk been shown result different individuals
more even when using same method individuals not shown themselves risk across different domains situations both studies
showed example different risk when making decisions involving versus money when financial versus
problems limit predictive validity based risk
given based risk should not scales based upon them not had much predicting people's choices behaviors across range situations
observed responses suggests they should not combined across domains
choice used scale people probability choice different domains life then combined into single risk
despite its scale still use lack better alternatives
some researchers recently risk may more framework risky choice example model its
psychological models perceived variable differ between individuals function context
they observed behavior i e risk taking into evaluation well between perceived perceived risk i e towards perceived risk assumed relatively stable across situations domains
provides multiple ways characteristics decision situation affect choices under risk
risk taking same person two situations might differ example because decision differ two domains e g financial decision while his towards perceived risk same both domains
empirical shown individual group differences risky choice options
smaller number studies also group differences perception perceived
after differences perception risk choice alternatives however people's their perceived risk perceived shown consistency
risk taking thus seems differences perception choice alternatives different domains while true towards risk shows consistency across situations evaluation risk perceived either i e up i e
decision domains shown different risk taking different include financial decisions decisions
decisions into smaller differ associated health e g social e g family decisions e g family life support
one find differences perception different domains decisions because decisions domains psychological risk e g identified known affect risk perception
reactions risk different domains differ result factors
given recent evidence about reactions risk individual domain differences subjective should not
based about set decisions under risk developed scale scale allows researchers both risk defined reported level risk taking defined risky activity function its perceived domains i e financial further into health social decisions
scale been used its factor structure wide range settings populations see
addition estimates et al reported estimates provided evidence validity respect risk taking social
construct validity was also via results risky task well tests differences
further evidence construct validity was provided who found health significantly predicted estimated
also used scale show individuals selected exhibit high levels risk taking one area e g taking risk other risky domains e g financial decisions
recent review large number measure risk decisions scale one three relevant environment they directly measure risk across number situations including take p number
scale its multiple risk risk taking risk perception
et al also used scale provide evidence psychological model risky choice
they found given level risk taking across risk domains yet his levels perceived risk together significant relationship between risk taking risk perception across domains was negative aversion
et al obtained similar findings at mean level across sample
use scale range applied settings current paper provides original scale et al had been developed
scale both i e number number items set groups levels
scale was groups do also scale literature
although scale been into several version was not available yet
above approach risk taking various risk well more stable component option being risky
present study could not due time constraints so focus here risk taking perceived risk
more specifically following derived model risky choice including work et al number there exists risk taking within between individuals number more perceived risk at i e domain level results significant reduction allows consistency number individuals across both even though risk perception risk taking degree aversion may differ between
while our goal findings reported et al taking very different approach using modeling investigate relationship between risk taking perception
our knowledge first time technique used context psychological models risky choice study risk taking general
one using modeling allows total risk taking into various components both within variation risk taking
