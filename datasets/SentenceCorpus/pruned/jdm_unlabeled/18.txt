introduction
numerical predictions predictions single most appropriate numerical estimation outcome required central interest both approaches judgment decisions
approach numerical predictions central interest social judgment theory derived about probabilistic
approach numerical predictions central interest heuristic biases research program
way predictions studied two different
they studied comparing them way their environment
particular cue probability learning experimental most popular experimental subjects learn environmental relationship between cues outcomes asked generate predictions based their learning
allows validity predictions correlation between prediction true outcome
other hand validity predictions against prediction rules
example their study examined predictions outcome three their predictive validity found they did not differ their measured prediction
predictions basic least predictions higher predictive validity predictor higher
thus at least at first approach study numerical prediction based predictions based their criterion whereas approach based predictions based standard
one issue approaches judgment decisions general numerical prediction particular their different experimental
possible research based approach experimental tend produce between judgments decisions environment whereas research based approach one question experiments described experiments so problems set up subjects would into if they were using particular heuristic tend produce biases
thus research associated two approaches take different people's their environment
particular whereas people's adaptive behavior accuracy program biases error
particular numerical predictions experiments almost always show people able learn experience improve their predictions
other hand more about people's ability learn experience argue regression effects all about us
our experience most tend
people do not notion regression p number

paper i examine two used experimental while heuristics biases
underlying both heuristics adaptive heuristics predictions
when they little experience rely subjects natural heuristics but also
but subjects experience prediction task heuristics adaptive heuristics
note contrast view natural heuristics adaptive view see them more data presented paper suggest heuristics natural since they associated little experience
cue probability learning may most experimental study between natural adaptive heuristics since early experiment subjects make predictions no experience whereas later they make predictions experience
yet very little research examined
view researchers approach not been natural heuristics while researchers effect experience cue probability learning people adaptive behavior
approach i also central role adaptive heuristics prediction despite central experimental work rather than heuristics early rather than later rather than
