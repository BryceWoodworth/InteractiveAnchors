three experiments investigated between ability first
study number demonstrated positive correlation between first their well its real power value
study number field experiment made higher potential higher
study number examined between perception its ability obtain alternatives specific first
found positive correlation between perception real value perception alternatives
study number here too analysis was behavior individual
however when were alternatives their first were related perceived alternatives
introduction
every must first one
first determine process outcomes both through process
but although first become important research subject recent years one simple question not been how do amount their first
research focus various cues reference points when amount their first
main reference points include own alternatives
several cues might not might some even effort find identify them
other hand available cues power not been investigated potential initial
one important variable ability
current article variable amount first
common sense might lead us predict positive correlation between perceived first will presented
will make higher because they greater more
common suggests may indeed case will more if you you considered high higher same will cost you more if you signals high
settings there widely belief tend higher
other hand though high involves also characterized attributes likely make less high leading negative effect first
there two main effect
first basis high them better search their environment find better than one
second if more than possible more would approach high
taken together two suggest high more alternatives given therefore their best alternative would better than low
better high less high
settings
one hand might against who them higher
however more
case might out many more so they will tend individual
though setting particularly their alternatives present often information about alternatives often
therefore its ability other hand typically more available more than its alternatives its so
know decision tend attention single dimension objects they
examples behavior effect tendency focus most important most effect tendency construct global basis single base judgments overall
thus because more cue than alternatives context positive effect first
article question do make different first same when different
though question simple far know not been examined
article relation between therefore its first
first two studies provide field tests prediction
