assumption people strategies solve inference problems they been made
experimental findings two previous studies strategy selection learning perspective people learn strategies making probabilistic
learning process strategy selection learning theory people develop subjective strategies they
they strategies their basis experience
study shown people did not strategy experiment
instead behavior observed at end experiment was result learning process described theory
second study theory able provide why participants only new environments dynamic inference situation
previous studies importance learning probabilistic
introduction
how do people make probabilistic likely
different strategies applied make all available information predict criterion
fact many researchers people different cognitive strategies making judgments decisions
do people apply different strategies probabilistic
if so how do they their strategy
approach strategy selection people
contrast i will argue selection via people learn strategies through experience strategy based past
i will describe computational theory learning process will use explain people's probabilistic two previous studies
