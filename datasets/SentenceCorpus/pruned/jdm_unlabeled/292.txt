researchers typically use money order obtain participants who specific behaviors interest
there however little understanding effects different types levels used
some results domain statistical suggest performance differences previously important may actually due differences types across studies number participants one statistical task they either
task was more than either other types
performance difficult tasks compared very very tasks was most

introduction
behavioral research participants typically must provided some type their much like typically must
although long been amount provided influence performance use research humans been characterized both across about
norm psychological research research often part some other form set amount i e
contrast norm research participants money scale those performance within research i e
recently been results theoretical research
past studies made case there real issue effects but they what studies show
focused found little evidence global performance but more effects reduced responses reduced effects performance specifically judgment tasks better effort
found similar results but also found more about effects financial
they cases where made difference they people's performance p number although do not optimal decisions many cases they decisions predictions models
moreover important they reduce data p number
within there been general about generally financial some finding important but others taking finding results
two factors
first factor use behaviors effects been simple tasks complex social tasks
if often financial should increase effort tasks will only tasks additional effort clear response
tasks participants at their best not likely show much tasks so difficult
second factor type used
when financial used they typically more directly norm but both very different terms structure financial
therefore remains how different types do do not affect performance across different types tasks different levels task difficulty
experimental contrast researchers use financial several
specifically reduce performance b problems i e more money always high levels attention c make target behaviors clear d towards optimal behavior performance
