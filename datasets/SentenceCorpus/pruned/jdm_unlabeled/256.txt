choices made identified strategies predicted observed choices number percent experiment number number percent experiment number cases
moreover experiment number directly compared respect their impact information search strategy description
found only differences between two methods
useful research identify choice strategies using did not increase its validity
introduction
processes judgment decision making been interest researchers several
context two major been used structural modeling process
structural modeling psychological processes provided information decisions judgments typically via multiple linear regression analysis
parameters models thought represent important features decision strategies instance if particular high weight regression being very important decision
despite its approach been phase processes take place between stimulus decision
example clear human decision making cannot simply decisions p number analyses been used most decision research not develop test process models decision behavior p number
response other against structural modeling others developed process approach methods research human problem
structural modeling aim process directly describe processes taking place during phase
achieve information search integration observed while they work decision task
used methods within information method active information search
following describe process discuss their
then present new called process developed identify decision processes underlying choice
uses various elements process measures above their some their
describe two experiments applied identify decision strategies
