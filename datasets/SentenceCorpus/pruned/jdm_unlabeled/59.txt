introduction
decision long between decision making often them different processing
despite theoretical literature view number empirical contrast effects limited
one lack research difficulty any particular decision
another could assumption analysis always lead better outcomes
some theories view assume under certain decisions more optimal results than rational
number empirical studies given support notion some tasks better without
results were often hypothesis lead people use make decisions decisions use heuristics
his however propose alternative performance when strategies not used
according thought theory decisions may thought high process weight information them into decisions via distributed processing
they argue process more complex decision situations than thought limited memory
empirical support participants presented positive negative attributes variety possible choices within particular e g
before choosing across three conditions participants decision condition make their decision at those thought condition four those thought condition make choice after four performance task
according best choices will made participants thought condition because task provides processing information
contrast thought condition assumed choices based processing
