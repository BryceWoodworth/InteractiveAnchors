recognition heuristic suggests when probabilistic based whether object not
overall findings processes fast heuristic many studies expressed need more integration recognition information
mechanism involved clear recognition strong influence choices finding might fact recognition cues affect thus more attention than cognitive cues
test assumption investigated whether recognition results direct signal physiological i e task
found recognition does not directly result increased physiological
moreover results show physiological increased increasing between recognition information additional cue information
findings support predictions derived model rather than predictions models
additional results confidence response times choice further demonstrated recognition information other cognitive cues manner
introduction
you before
end later than you had expected you
you make few find two both at similar rate
you know about however you do one them
would you choose
according probabilistic could recognition information
more specifically according individuals several tools i e fast heuristics structure environment some rely one information at time decision
recognition heuristic one most tools suggests probabilistic about specific criterion e g two more made basis recognition so objects e g will chosen over ones
indeed been shown people actually objects over ones behavior may lead rather accurate
several studies recognition information used manner predicted
example additional information been found affect choices recognition
while been several studies their findings need more integration recognition information
moreover studies focused choice behavior
yet since choice predictions made different models often difficult clear underlying cognitive processes
several recent studies address problem example testing process measures decision time confidence
yet additional research needed role recognition information decision making well examine cognitive processes underlying its use choice behavior
achieve investigated nature processes underlying use recognition information probabilistic using physiological choice decision times confidence dependent measures
derived predictions basis perspective predictions derived model
specifically investigate whether recognition leads increased physiological other cognitive information suggested models
been recognition information like other signals might generated may cognitive information
thus examined whether recognition information during decision process
tested against model decision making
model was selected because been shown account well decision times confidence recognition tasks because makes specific predictions physiological
model information integration based processes perception consistent decision tasks
available information taken into account according its importance option information
model four possible
first when presented decision task related information form representation task
second processes lead maximization consistency information alternative at same time information
result consistent representation available information
third decision choice alternatives if one alternative other i e if there information alternative alternative chosen
however if information consistency certain threshold decision step processes change structure network e g pattern information search different weights different information
among other model research shows available information occur during decision processes
