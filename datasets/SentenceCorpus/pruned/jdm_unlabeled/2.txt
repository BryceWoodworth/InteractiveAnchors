according model risk communication effect about risk behavior depends their
depends how good source been past
depends how similar agent values their own
show past quality degree similarity between values effects two types agent behavior degree expressed source weight given revealed
findings support et al model
also found revealed was affected more than differences quality
not clear how finding should within et al model
introduction
social important factor many aspects human behavior
but widely one psychological state based upon positive behavior another
thus person who depends reduce likelihood size negative outcome some situation when expected value outcome lower
experimental work been out various including behavioral game theory risk communication
work report here into three domains
risk communication provides information people about levels risk associated
signals based those when fact they may not
provides evidence sense above
when people rely more certain their behavior they more those
recent research into determined number factors
factors into two groups
first ability knowledge
second
basis findings developed their model
version shown number
according model two different types determine degree people their
first also known simply social second known confidence
produced two types results behaviors various types
example people may their they may use them form their own judgments they may basis their
determined past history quality produced source
type information been shown affect people place greater weight information sources who been more accurate past
determined how similar values their own
et al model predicts people will take more whose values they more similar their own
prediction their model not been tested
our aim here provide test
past researchers into measured using behavioral measures
example given two different value numerical variable e g risk level judgment first than second greater influence first
hence relative judgments different sources provides behavioral means relative influence those sources
contrast researchers into required people make numerical estimates their different sources information typically using scales
however behavioral measures may not always
example people may state they do not agent when their behavior they do
they may do because behavioral processes not processes required expression
indeed there some evidence revealed do under certain conditions
given results measure both ways present study
et al model predicts similarity values will increase increase influence
however does not make any prediction about effects physical similarity
there good people will more who same they who same they
because there evidence values particularly those risk more likely similar people same similar
result physical i e similarity may degree value similarity
if does who similar likely more
also who similar both likely more than those who similar them just one respect
