people report themselves above average simple tasks below average difficult tasks
paper effect than prior
new people relative evaluation especially subjective measures
paper then series four studies test
tests other
results suggest occurs at response during people subjective response scales order choose answer
because little effect objective measures would affected if at
introduction
there research findings comparative judgment
both effects tend direct measures than measures comparative judgment
given robustness biases comparative judgment
direct measures comparison people explicitly compare two comparing themselves others
instance had their participants take number was either very mean number percent correct very difficult mean number percent correct
direct comparative measure asked how do you relative others
participants scale number well below average number well above average
those who expected they would above average while difficult expected below average
measures people evaluate target target being compared using same standard
instance also asked their participants estimate their own
measure comparison estimated performance others
those who had taken their own would higher than those others whereas those who had taken difficult their own would lower
fact both effects direct measures comparison than measures comparison
other words task difficulty effect than direct comparative
task difficulty had significantly larger effect direct measure than had measure
task difficulty number percent direct measure
contrast difficulty only number percent measure
most popular difference
people weight target when making comparative judgments
target comparison more than other
may several including fact information about generally more more more than information about others
result when performance good above average when below average
theory effects tasks effects tasks direct than judgments psychological
result differences knowledge target not simply result response scale used people's
what evidence
number studies presented results analyses
analyses three variables number evaluation target individual number evaluation group group number direct comparative judgment individual relative group
results typically demonstrate direct comparative judgment highly correlated own performance but only often correlated performance reference
number shows analysis using data
direct comparative judgments weight target but target more number than number
may accurate description results analyses
however not accurate description underlying psychological processes comparative judgment
important analyses suggests result may not actual person making comparison
if people making then there should less estimates group average than estimates individual performance
after all if estimated group average then there should no estimates group average would therefore comparative judgments analyses
but there additional way analyses often judgments target often measured subjective scales
example had their participants rate using scale number very number very
comparative judgments those same were made using scale much less than average number much more than average
work demonstrated responses scales relevant comparison group
who measures number number would more likely describe than would same
case others evaluation depends context relevant comparison others
subjective response scales measures either relative
measures performance will at least part measures relative performance well
simple test does well
if one person number percent other number all above number percent when asked how well did you do test
person who number percent rate number number point scale if scale very very well
when relative performance measured using subjective response scales should judgments may performance
should no performance highly relative performance when they both measured subjective response scales
some extent they same
us second why effects direct than measures comparative judgment
error two distinct if they were one
people relative evaluation each other when making comparative judgments
when people asked compare themselves others their comparative judgments their judgments their own
response scales participants scale order their own knowledge response scale
open subjective scales influence other
after having well at task people more likely rate themselves being above average even if simple task should expected do well
new hypothesis tested paper effect not due some over effect questions subjective response scales
new part idea way comparative judgment measured
predicts effects across both subjective objective measures comparative judgment hypothesis predicts effects will when comparative judgments measured using objective response
would people make more accurate estimates comparative judgment but often question ways most likely comparative judgment
not issue important two
first subjective scales single most used measure psychological research including work comparative judgment
if measures responses may respect both prior findings optimal design future studies
second would psychological processes at work comparative judgment
if people make accurate comparative judgments when provided response scales shows at response during people's into behavioral responses
if instead relative evaluation were during then would appear people's responses all comparative judgments response question because there would no evaluation
without effects determined
not goal paper show only effects only distinct other
simple important
suggests prior research often size both effects through use measures
also suggests solution problem objective measures
four experiments presented here examine testing its specific predictions many other effects possible
i use both subjective response scales also objective measures
i find effects tasks effects difficult tasks more objective measures
experiment number effects shown them through experimental provide participants clear information about themselves others
full information about should rule out based greater estimates others because information theories assume errors people's others
however predicts effects even presence full information but especially subjective measures comparative judgment
experiments number number number also provide participants full information about target but order rule out role participants only asked compare other individuals each other
finally research shown effects when group rather than individual
order rule out influence experiments number number participants compare two individuals whose known
fact effect even context but only subjective direct measures better than other theories
research presented paper theory research several different
first four studies i report first effects test comparing judgments their
key prediction all four studies effects tasks effects tasks subjective than objective direct comparative judgments
second four studies presented here do another prior research not present participants information about performance target
important out other effects
third experiments number number number take tests their having people compare two targets about they complete information
