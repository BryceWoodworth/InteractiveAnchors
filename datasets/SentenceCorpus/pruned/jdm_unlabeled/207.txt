aversion been widely observed judgments
using scenarios decision analysis investigate aversion pairs individuals
examine risky original judgments their judgments when they up
our experiment participants were first asked their
they were then at random into were asked their amount same
amount was two individuals
our experiment one involved no involved different
found risk aversion well aversion
smaller than two average
our study thus aversion group setting
introduction
much theoretical experimental research decision analysis examined how individuals do should make choices set they risky options
but not much focus been decisions made groups though group decisions common
would understand relationship between individual decisions group decisions first setting
direction primary question address here via experiment when decision group called do they exhibit more less aversion than observed individual settings
note some situations forecasting e g technique two indeed better than one
context policy find groups make better decisions than individuals
therefore natural examine how decisions under differ when made versus when made
many real world decisions groups will
will individuals our scenarios their knowledge see probability due our scenarios at least number number therefore become less
risk aversion consistent rational decision making been observed variety settings
evidence aversion been
rational decision should not
found aversion when individuals evaluate single gamble setting found aversion reduced when making
found settings aversion reduced independent but not
at least two less aversion thus higher
first two people may more understand setting they
because our subjects know our scenarios they choose either between two subjects may lead probability at least number number
second individual regret should group setting
