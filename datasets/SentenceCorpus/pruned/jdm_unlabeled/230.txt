introduction
human decision-making its does not always
individual differences cognitive predict judgment decision-making
variety theories theories individual differences processes however between decision processes
what cognitive processes give relationship between cognitive decision making under risk
previous research examined individual differences decision making under risk known probabilities
low expected utility processes assumed probabilities potential gains losses i e
demonstrated choices associated cognitive test designed measure more processes rather than first
cognitive test known other general cognitive ability measures mathematical problems response
demonstrated higher individuals did not exhibit clear risk gains losses predicted theory
when given choice between gain number versus number percent number gain theory predicted risk aversion selection certain number
however people higher cognitive more often selected options higher expected values i e probability potential risky gain number compared lower individuals
there several mechanisms may account between cognitive decision making under risk
example one make choices
suggests expected values may play role although not likely only factor
more generally suggest individual differences judgments decisions often memory high ability individuals may make choices via
other research individual differences risky decision making may also general knowledge understanding probabilities i e
people high particularly ability probabilities less affected because they items number percent correct into number percent
