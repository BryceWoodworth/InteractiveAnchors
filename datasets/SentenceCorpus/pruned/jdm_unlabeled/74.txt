present strategy decision use find alternative alternative decision space
decision alternatives exhibit between values weights
show situations where alternatives utility distance alternative choice alternative
two experiments participants among well alternatives were
experiment number four alternatives were designed way choice each alternative would consistent one particular choice strategy one was strategy
experiment number participants were presented alternative number arbitrary alternatives
both experiments participants choose alternative
alternative was average more than other alternatives
addition measures between given alternatives alternative large preference order choices different types alternatives
findings both choices alternatives alternative
introduction
involves many decision situations one alternative chosen set several alternatives
true large but also choices what
all choice situations there might several alternatives cannot
indeed fundamental feature several alternatives at least some people some times depending their different constraints
thus there so
usually decision find alternative choice may more less other alternatives before making choice
they through may find alternative
ability make choices solve life because lack time fundamental feature
present paper strategies people use situations
how do people find most alternative out several alternatives difficult each other respect their overall
suggest situations individuals will choose alternative close their alternative
itself using strategy call strategy
according strategy decision choose alternative there between values importance weights attributes provided overall alternatives
study choices test validity strategy presented participants alternatives choose each
utility could used approximate alternative alternatives were they were based attributes weights participants generated themselves
study focused how participants find alternative i e choice rather than how they up complex structure choice
