make decisions every many them without much
two important open questions what minimum time required make choices above accuracy
what impact additional decision-making time choice accuracy
investigated questions four experiments subjects made binary choices using responses under either accuracy
subjects were able make above decisions little number choose their over number percent trials at average number
further their responses either them explicitly about their choices hand generated about number percent increase accuracy
together results suggest make accurate choices those made at significantly than previously reported
introduction
make decisions every many them without much
consider example local
while often involve observation suggests many others made at
important open question decision-making well domain research what at human brain most options
previous work computational basis decision-making provides some
multiple studies shown its provide computational description how choices made able provide good quantitative how accuracy response times underlying parameters choice problem
all models predict been observed data
however literature not experimentally measured at decisions made
previous decision-making studies also suggest decisions made but provide few about how fast decisions made when goal due constraints
example subjects made real choices between pairs stimuli computer reaction times number number choices number number most difficult ones
reaction times number range been reported various other choice studies
studies more complex choices those involving options reported reaction times number number range
however work judgments suggests brain may able out decisions much
showed subjects could natural according whether not they contain using task number trials activity number
found subjects could between task at fast mean number number minimum number number measured responses activity number both tasks
further used novel choice show pair natural could compared presence one more number minimum number
similar showed subjects could expression body one less than number mean
identify human performed above mean reaction time number minimum number
finally recently showed individuals make between two numbers high accuracy number average able perform above little number
note case simple choice all experiments subjects had stimuli their analyze stimuli make judgment then outcome judgment through response
thus given similar computational natural brain should able make accurate simple choices at much than those been reported literature
four experiments designed address two basic questions what minimum time required make choices above accuracy
what impact additional computational time choice accuracy
important difficulty questions reaction time measures standard choice amount time make decision i e compare values since they include time requires stimuli choice
here use was developed studies described above allows us problems
minimum times at make choices above level well impact additional time choice accuracy important two
first since significant decisions seems made at provides into general quality human decision-making
increased new decisions made further increases importance question
