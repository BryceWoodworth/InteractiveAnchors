previous research shown between particularly social moral judgments
some studies suggested between moral judgments observed patients
order investigate how brain moral judgment asked sample number patients number number number participants number number number into three different moral
group presented higher responses moral when compared pattern
also found negative between performance recognition social responses moral
results suggested preference responses type social recognition
overall our findings suggest moral judgments associated normal social processing important role both moral judgment
introduction
moral was theories role moral judgments
more recently empirical suggested moral judgment based emotional responses produced processes
according emotional processes play role human decision making including moral decisions
based moral decision making support variety empirical work including studies
instance several studies groups brain between emotional processing moral
studies suggest emotional states influence judgments some moral situations
their study show moral decision making tasks same brain involved processing
emotional been observed patients brain specifically patients demonstrate emotional specific
related difficulty processing specific social e g moral values
despite emotional regulation response patients their knowledge social moral
sense some patients example general information ability problem visual memory perception knowledge social moral rules
emotional processing pattern moral also been observed population
experimental study moral analysis subject reactions moral social situations specifically designed two alternative actions against each other choice will one involved
often into three moral moral
requires decision involves moral
moral subject must typically choose between leading greater
between moral
they consider moral if three first must likely
second must particular person set
third must not result existing different
three expressed terms you
criterion out most you criterion represented individual notion action direct way will rather than agent
moral if three
another important between moral their emotional level moral characterized high level emotional
particularly because moral option also response
perspective correct action one total all people affected
option involves direct action towards specific individual will results strong emotional aversion response tendency
single person individual might moral goal however choose option far natural normal individuals
brain patients processing often produce pattern judgments moral
example patients choose their own order group people who would including
patients often even if means them suggest emotional
argue high rate judgments observed brain patients emotional response suggests their decisions cognitive
functional studies recognition moral judgment tasks regulation emotional well
patients response patterns some when compared patients other brain regions
several studies further regions would moral actions little among researchers
example suggest involved moral while region not only judgment type but also processing more complex i e social
actually both authors unique all three regions together relevant moral judgments emotional cognitive
studies processing moral judgment also provided little
order understand whether leads response differences moral high emotional level examined subjects
both studies reported performance patients
following research also subjects showed response pattern processing judgment moral
results idea
region more moral judgments evidence shows social emotional leading some degree social
pattern more over time because social become cognitive
although several studies examined emotional changes brain patients few studies changes specifically subjects investigated possible between social processing moral judgment
thus our first goal compare performance patients group subjects moral judgment task
secondary objective whether performance task when specific region were considered
since literature between social processing e g judgment moral our third aim analyze patients performance social recognition whether responses moral
