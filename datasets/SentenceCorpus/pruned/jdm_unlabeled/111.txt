memory development popular new way
theory between support yet information support analysis
here i review findings development theory its most recent risky decision making
findings include memory memory associated better effects increase when numbers decision problems increases brain connectivity memory judgment decision making heuristics biases based increase attention effects provide critical tests comparing theory expected utility theory its e g theory
judgment decision making real life also discussed adaptive decision making health
introduction
what approaches judgment decision making will next
will turn into assumptions
questions new they place their most their time choosing making impact field
however although new original they also research
make important must prior their own those others
i provide recent one theory their prior research
moreover were chosen view future
about approaches been
more than simply more than because they based behavior
gain greater our field new
what i others taking will
among new most prior memory
researchers memory judgment decision making
memory much more than i explain
number theories memory common
development defined changes across another
because risk taking health although less within judgment decision making
cognitive heuristics biases theories judgment decision making only now results their core assumptions
results whether choices rational adaptive good
results been
sense rational they heuristics biases judgment decision making new
least among new
concept potential about judgment decision making field new original effect practical changes behavior
understanding its some tools might use p number behavior better
memory development popular new way
theory between memory information
people use their represent information even when information
view but not
most
however memory
increase
findings were predicted framework described here but they core assumptions other theories
section below i describe how account memory development about
