thus far know little about process value why one person may more likely than another value
present evidence perceived group lead people more likely consider preferences values
specifically three studies out show more people more likely they report preference value studies number number b people more values when they study number c effect likelihood value perception high study number
discuss findings understanding suggest future research into values
introduction
become particularly difficult solve when preferences sources into values
studies behavioral research suggest people process values terms associated rules rather than their value
specifically when people preferences into values they appear use rules about values any values
more money one people make over their values more people
thus standard techniques people when values involved

while many values others
into value part his rule
paper report first research program process
our research was two first people may preferences objects preferences into thus values include previously preferences second process more likely occur under conditions high perceived group
