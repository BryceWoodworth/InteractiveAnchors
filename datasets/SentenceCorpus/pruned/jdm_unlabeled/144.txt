introduction
expected losses decision their decision-making process
when making choice tend options some ways but others
rather they more likely choose option because may seen least choice
choice strategy having give up any attributes other
decision chosen attributes other two
effect occurs when likelihood one option will chosen over its alternative introduction third option makes first option appear option
concept effect been shown robust many including group decision making difference
most prior research effect focused choice single during specific decisions
yet often multiple single
instance they may several at
given choice among three available b c high b option will change their choice behavior option
specifically will they option predicted effect theory will they every available option
increases may find choosing only one option multiple may decision risk instead therefore they may their choice option strategy
one distinct multiple several available alternatives their choices among different options
choices among several options allows associated obtain variety options
people predicted theory achieve state order their
multiple among all alternatives people state also decision risk
hence effect may different than
moreover available options demonstrate their tendency preference variety
tendency may when people need expected losses decision their
since tendency people their choice multiple among available alternatives may effect
past research suggested may affect effect because people may make choices losses when making multiple choice decisions
need provide their choices
need assumed positive influence effect because focus decision choice good options choice good option
option seems when single but may not choosing only alternative all multiple
hence having make several choices among multiple options positive impact decision
finally variety alternatives choices far their optimal level
level response environmental stimuli
when complexity below optimal level people increase when above optimal level they reduce
therefore if choosing option all multiple cannot provide they may some alternatives other than one
study how effect
effect when increases particularly when people their choices
furthermore suggest impact effect tendency formula derived concept
