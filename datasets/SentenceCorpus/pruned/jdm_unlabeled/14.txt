several studies propose decisions
authors proposed process theory predictions what cognitive people use input their judgment process

important question what extent occur part rule if they strategy ability identify judgment strategy
article data demonstrate between memory cue well data where expected does not occur
contrast common assumption previous models results suggest strategy
introduction
models particularly learning decisions
years researchers shown interest basis other judgments decisions
thus been many judgments like example decision may at least part similar previous examples
despite interest nature interaction between memory other processes processes relatively little empirical
predicting class basis four different test results
when at might his high should associated high
his high should also associated high since very difficult
different individual test results their combined impact
judgment process based knowledge between individual cues tests their difficulty criterion
other hand might test results very similar
since number out number give number well
judgment based similar
although examples highly all at times both processes
what less clear relatively little attention judgment decision research what task properties one other process what processes between processes
memory processes been context example classification learning learning
without models assumption transition one process another occurs at level either learning rule models
alternative however involving sequential tests strategies over trials
according view choice one rather than other strategy result active process problem perceived strategy
aim article review data judgment demonstrate between processes well make appropriate
data turn nature mechanisms between processes
