article i will show how several observed biases human probabilistic good heuristics making environment where probabilities associated them
previous results show weight functions observed stochastic bayesian point view
will review those results see bayesian methods should also used part other known biases
means although observed errors still errors under conditions they demonstrated they percent solution real life problems
heuristics allow fast bayesian inference would evolutionary advantage since they would give us efficient way making decisions
introduction
well known fact humans make when presented probabilistic problems
was observed when choice between different people make their choices way not decision theory
several describe behavior exist literature including theory theory number models
all models use idea when probabilistic people probabilistic values using function use values order gamble would provide maximum expected
exact all involved values associated each aspects each model but models people do not use exact known probabilistic values when making their decisions
there also models based different approaches decision sampling model
decision sampling people make their decision making values them describe many characteristics human well
recently strong evidence models describe human behavior better than theory
several tests shown people simple decision rules
if presented two possible outcomes example number percent number one outcome number percent same number another possible result should make no difference if both outcomes were combined into one single number percent number
property called been observed not always
other strong decision theory experiments people should stochastic
stochastic when there two available possible gains one them good other one at least one gain more
per example given g number number number number number number g number number number number number number number number number g g since first outcome same second outcome g into two g same more than g depending
only rational choice here g but tests show people do not always simple rule
since models theory theory both stochastic weight models predict those better description real behavior
weight models each given different weight so outcome will given more weight
allows those basic
however although weight models good models how problem understanding why way do not them
theory predicts very simple strong makes sense why people would make
recently why humans make was still not clear
evolutionary suggested makes no sense humans would their made probability therefore there must some those biases
was also suggested since our had observed instead probability values observed biases might if people were presented data form observed theorem problem
experiment idea
however other studies those shown frequency improve only under some
if those not frequency either no effect might even probability tested subjects
other hand heuristics biases point view given our limited errors should expected best one humans would use heuristics efficient but error
fact they shown decision problems there simple heuristics do good
but since many involved experiments not too difficult perform question our probabilistic still needed
if using heuristics perform probabilistic understanding when good heuristic why tests important question
number idea people should simply use observed instead probability values bayesian point view
our should well uncertainty their own observations but make complete what would if our therefore our own were actually more than simple
if they had brain although using rules way bayesian inference instead evaluation they would better make decisions therefore would been good adaptation
other words our who were would better than any possible who consider uncertainty their analysis
would lead those
another learn those heuristics up them provide better
but even if dynamics our heuristics good learning should lead us bayesian answer than one
so makes sense if humans actually than current literature them
evidence idea our bayesian exists
et al shown observed bayesian models those models provide optimal inference
tests human cognitive judgments about seems suggest our provide very good prediction real statistics
recent work i proposed adaptive probability theory
biases human probabilistic actually approximation bayesian inference
if one people all probability values if they were even when they not make some assumptions about sample size where those probabilities would been observed follows observed functions obtained
here i will review those results also show were introduced explain functions explain other observed biases
i will show some those biases result make environment where probabilities associated them
functions theory whole class models use functions describe our behavior predicted bayesian point view
even observed theory stochastic need weight models described also predicted using
i will propose bayesian methods should used part number other biases
finally note what point view needed
usually involves theories should describe set data making predictions those theories testing them experiments
decision theory however requires work
because other decision theory us how should
does not describe real behavior since based assumptions about what best choice not about how real people
its testing against other decision strategies long provides optimal decisions theory correct even if does not predict behavior any agents
means certain actions sense they far optimal decisions even though they real actions real people
decision theory means not every model actually predict behavior
given observed behavior understanding what makes way also
where
its main show behavior based analysis decision problem follows theory
assumptions analysis might therefore observed behavior would not optimal
means our common sense not
however if well most real life problems either good adaptation well learned
make between theories
means work sense understand problems our way they do
while based theory was designed observed biases
means does not best actual description real behavior although might
even if other theories weight models decision sampling actually describe way our work long their predictions will show actual behavior predicted those theories approximation optimal decisions
tests show if actually best description not will see suggests new experiments problem base rate order understand better our
but main goal show real behavior does well
