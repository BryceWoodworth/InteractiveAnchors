heuristic decision-making models like rely environmental
they limited search available information there structure decision-making environment
at least two information found search more important than information found later correlated information information found early search predictive information found later
develop new approaches search cue make clear open
then demonstrate environment three new environments when how support
do focus not accuracy most previous studies but measure its decision-making process
particular consider whether decisions based single information because search information different decision
using measure show when two environmental present decisions made limited search after search but both often necessary
introduction
number was first time us were play
us like was one most any
their game was number number over need call during
making predictions about outcomes difficult but made some predictions
predict whether not us would its first each
at some point early us after would no need further
no who was us outcome clear
also made predictions during games
about number play first against us number number
was clear us would large without game
both decisions about us because not all available information used so information cannot change decision based information used
not examined game not
yet decision further information seems both cases
not reaction limited time cognitive but recognition nature environment decision-making taking place
