cognitive processes underlying impact bias methods been further
present examined both individual differences variables associated cognitive processing forecasting
results showed perceived importance event memory were both associated increased impact bias some participants whereas had no relationship bias

part involves making predictions about events most outcomes
decisions who require predictions emotional
when asked make people predict direction their emotional reactions but show ability predict their
more specifically people generally emotional impact future events phenomenon impact bias
people response response whereas reactions tend more than
although impact bias greater events been found predictions both positive negative events including decisions outcomes money
because people often make decisions based their predicted emotional reactions impact bias leads errors decision making
forecasting research importance both predicted actual emotional reactions since one type reaction cannot taken other
due difficulty researchers often chosen examine only use design predicted actual reactions event measured across different samples
fact only small number n number number total forecasting studies used design same participants provided both predicted actual reactions same event
only two focused individual difference variables
although impact bias been described past researchers relatively general phenomenon study individual differences forecasting help thought processes underlying impact bias
past research theory memory important individual difference variables may influence
present design was used determine whether individual differences cognitive processing influence predicted reactions actual reactions both
furthermore account core impact bias use strategy well perceived importance event question
