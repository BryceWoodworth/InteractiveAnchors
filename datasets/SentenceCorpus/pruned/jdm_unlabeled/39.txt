people gamble more themselves than what they others
question computer task subjects set number
subjects selected one at time after being number were good per one was all money end game
subjects could at any time their
some subjects game others observed
both groups what was rational i e number but were than
even after outcome i e having after how question was i e what they themselves would do what should do
discuss results relation theories decision making rational systems
introduction
you at game when who hand another
you what
should at number
but you same
after all decision making likely depend cues processes not available when choices others
reward having good potential regret all
then you may same decision whether you much information needed including probability size potential loss all available rational choice
example decision making both rational factors
rational processes using cost analysis determine best choice
contrast processes using heuristics history reward determine next behavior
processes more decisions than judgments
one may their own reactions
furthermore system rewards
contrast usually not affected when they influence rewards their being action
simple terms actions will show tendency
thus reward should action potential what would
current study specific instance its relation rational
used version task first developed risk taking
were computer subjects were were good would each while one was would make them all money they had thus game
subjects one at time when their
task could how many turn whether turn next
either way expected value task
thus rational decision should after number
two experiments possible rational decision making whether were active task
