people their own other preferences many domains
effect may not apply targets if people distance themselves negative targets associated previous research shown
current research examine relationship between same initial preferences stimuli
specifically examined after major test influence effect targets
individuals who initial were among relative distribution population
finding suggests people may negative effects when there characteristics between
introduction
number
when asked why i history one
current research whether response between might more likely than what would expected
specifically predict who initial will more likely particular than would individuals who do not initial
prediction individuals who initial will more likely at consistent research demonstrated people initial their first over other
preference called effect both subjective choices targets over targets different
been shown influence choices domains including preferences
example one study found people d people population
people more likely than expected people more likely
together findings affect judgment choice positive into representation target
assumed people should associations negative stimuli
based several studies shown people close others order
example people less likely recently game compared recently game
groups positive negative feedback group task
they found compared control group demonstrated more while group demonstrated less
under other individuals may negative features target they relationship
found subjects who they less after description his than those who did not
recent study extended work initial negative outcome task performance
specifically they found people whose first c d lower than people other used represent more likely out than other because people tend negative outcome much they when they their
other words people first c d may lower perform well
research negative stimuli people may not always their associations negative stimuli their
negative impact
help its
if would common initial would no more money than
if would history so much time money
case would so given previous research people less likely less
money both processes above well literature general
however there when people may not their negative targets may even make actions others they
example people will behavior their against even if behavior at cost
found was like positive affect between
if group increases likelihood behavior actions other group then other do same
taken together previous associations allow us towards may others
relation there at least some evidence target lead people help their
us people would i more likely money more money same initial
