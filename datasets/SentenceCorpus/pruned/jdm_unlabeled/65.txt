about decision processes often about decision other cognitive processes
at same time existing decision models at levels making difficult compare them
provide how detailed cognitive allow problems
make our point address whether processes better describe how people make decisions
number models decision processes including recognition heuristic various other popular decision models
how models tested model comparison models one experiment them another
behavioral data best models
models recognition heuristic models between processes between existing decision models
introduction
one way increase theories decision making cognitive processes decision-making mechanisms assumed
corresponding process models predict not only what decision person will make but also how information used make decision will
past seen develop process models fact models become popular
predictions made models number example whether people rely processes inference choice estimation
yet often process models relative process data against they tested
article show how process models them cognitive
will make our point class models assume people make decisions memory
models been at focus about what processes describe people's decisions best when they make about unknown states world when predicting likely will likely number
