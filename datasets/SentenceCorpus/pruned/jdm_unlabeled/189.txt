results thought does not lead better decision making performance than thought results found et al since other studies showed positive though not significant effect thought total number experiments was
suggests there little evidence advantage decision making using thought
however potential shows further study would help identify situations thought those not
introduction
series studies finding thought leads better decision making performance complex problems than thought
thought defined cognitive processes take place
second true simple decision about them better
paper only first
common all experiments described experimental technique
participants two three groups provided number information about number options choose instance four
each option described same number attributes usually attributes choice option
example all choice options might size
typically attributes either not
all information about all choice options presented either e g e g study fixed order fixed amount time
prior information participants they will choose one options b rate each option e g
then following information participants either make choice between options about their choice fixed amount time same amount time before making their decision
when number factors considered high number attributes decision therefore complex thought will lead better decision performance than
better decision making i call here defined choosing higher options more positive features
however although most experiments found effect direction effects often statistical when comparing group directly
example first reported experiment number study critical comparison did not statistical p less than number
context important point out sequence experiments out only first two were at differences between decision under versus thought
other experiments investigated further aspects what was become theory thought
example experiments number number study without attention effect required two conditions complex simple one were number information participants
however even though studies did not contrast thought they provided data notion thought form large amount information
thought according very useful information respect particular criterion example amount space must available
work case mathematical
other hand limited thus large information
thought other hand processing process information natural mechanism information
differences between two thought been described some additional characteristics who basic thought well complex decision situations multiple sources relevant information
despite its empirical its development theory thought not been without
number example thought effects were rates rather than different processing
theory was also limited sample size studies was about theory context out theory was not
addition data limited they almost include studies one
present article
first aim provide data decision making effect sample stimulus
study was also designed additional information rule out potential alternative thought effect
