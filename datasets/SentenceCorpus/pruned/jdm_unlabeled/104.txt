participants either before task they predict two events would occur each number trials
one event e number number trials other e number number
each two number trials group prediction event
contrast group predicted e number more often each
after task participants were asked rules they used
rule complexity were related e number predictions number trials
participants also after predictions before predicting e number time rules
results support hypothesis process matching experiments process function
introduction
probability learning experiments one event e number better than other e number event independent responses
task predict event will occur each
although participants could predicting e number they tend prediction outcome probabilities many trials
example if e number occurs number percent trials e number occurs other number percent trials people usually predict e number about number percent their choices trials
behavior because only number percent trials number number number number instead number percent rate always predicting e number
