experiments suggested decisions experience differ decisions description
decisions decision often their payoffs
previous authors effect outcomes
paper i provide further analysis effect experiment involves series simple binary choice
current experiment decisions small times feedback each decision provided decision outcomes
participants learn about outcome distributions through sampling they not explicitly provided prior information payoff structure
current results suggest effect than suggested previous research important payoff effect effect outcomes decisions experience features must learned through sampling process
introduction
much attention been given between decisions description decisions experience
decisions people experience difficulty understanding uncertainty
two main determine effect events decisions experience
first tendency rely small samples past
tendency leads events most samples not likely include events
second tendency rely recent
when information available decision limited obtained payoffs tendency leads effect outcomes
effect was first introduced his observation if then would
however would even
states effect fundamental problem learning likelihood decisions them
effect bias against risky alternative binary decisions
bias tendency actions been recent actions outcomes
previous research decisions value effect
whereas some studies demonstrate its importance other studies suggest effect
paper i choice problems
authors experiments three choice problems problem number number number were performed participants each involving number binary choice between alternative higher expected value alternative lower expected value
number shows payoff structure each problem
example one selection problem number made participants four points probability number number point
participants their study were experiments many trials their goal each t t number number was one two computer
each payoff random payoff distribution associated selected
thus prior information was participants had base their decisions experience
participants
number shows rate overall choices each problem example overall choices was number number problem number
data considered tendency rely small samples than effect
support problem number used where number participants were asked between computer number each selection random payoff distribution associated different number among possible options participants had rely feedback obtained similar situations past
problem number outcome number also outcome probability number number
problem number small samples effect lead predictions
small samples outcome number will prediction will
effect predicts learning their likelihood decisions they i e example thus outcome
thus effect outcome number will prediction will
reported observed choices over number trials was number number
their results suggest tendency rely small samples than effect
studies demonstrated value assumed tendency rely small samples effect
example all leading models recent choice prediction focused decisions experience described alternative assumptions
however some recent results appear question relative two effects
review suggests events studies examine decisions experience complete feedback
design effect complete feedback
different however shown studies focus decisions experience limited feedback feedback limited obtained payoff payoff payoff option not presented
studies strong events when small samples effect lead same predictions but no clear events when two lead predictions
results consistent predictions leading models choice prediction
example best model et al predicts only number number problem number
main goal current paper effect than suggested
order achieve goal i problem number number number
note effect bias low option problem number number
