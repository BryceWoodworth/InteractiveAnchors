people their reactions future events decisions phenomenon been impact bias
evidence suggests events one judgments affect
generally assumed because people they will event
however there another may occur because processing bias
first experiment showed also affect associated past decisions
second experiment showed same effect
third experiment not because affect judgments changes about
indeed affect same way
cognitive tasks any processing required judgments affect
introduction
recent evidence suggests people estimate their reactions future events will more than they actually
been impact bias
et al suggested psychological mechanism phenomenon what they
et al words when people generate predictions about how they will after future event people focus too much event question not other future events
also been found influence people's judgments their reactions past events
example et al found people's judgments events were more positive than their judgments were events
been suggested same people too much attention event not other events occur at same time event
et al demonstrated people complete they expected time event reduced associated event
they had its effect specifically they suggested effect reduce extent people about event after
they suggested effect could about one two ways
first people complete may make them other events would their them about target event
result they would they their
second people may focus their attention other events rather than likelihood being those events
other words they may event will out other events same time
result they their event
fact et al found events had no effect level affect was event
researchers hypothesis was not hypothesis provided more account their
here two
first aim investigate whether judgment affect i e regret well judgments affect
second aim investigate account account both judgments
particular contrast task account
according alternative view occurs because processing affect associated
more specifically judgments affect associated particular event likely involve cognitive processes memory
people perform additional task processes because makes its own memory
