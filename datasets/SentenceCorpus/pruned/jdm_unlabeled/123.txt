online suggested two additional items were correlated scale considered them
factor analysis responses factors us set number items represent risk domain
set items use general

our next step will items complete scale properties determine whether distinct domain other risky individual differences risk
introduction
risk preference risk important decision making under uncertainty
widely used measures risk likelihood defined risky perceived risk likelihood perceived risky under assumption may differ domain risk
risk domains health social risk taking
each domain risk perception perception risk measured using number point scale responses items per domain
although one very few measures use decisions recent review only measure evidence measures risk perception perception risk health scale behaviors does not include items sample types risk health settings
example et al found no differences health among potential potential despite differences their expressed health
two also reported health scale may require measure also associated domain because several health items behaviors
goal study was develop designed measure risky
our work initial results itself through three studies cognitive online
studies what been validity structural validity scale development
