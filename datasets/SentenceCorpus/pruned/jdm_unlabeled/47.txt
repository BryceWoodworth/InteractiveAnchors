common effect been standard theories risky choice since its over number years
however its conditions necessary effect well
two experiments test effects losses event
experiment number found occurs both gain loss produced across
experiment number found outcomes even when probabilities used do not increase common
results experiment number consistent theory current leading theory risky choice

introduction
when expected utility theory was first proposed was assumed was not only theory risky decision making but theory well
however did not work theory risky choice
one first most was presented number
one given choice between following proposed will generally choose certain gamble
however when asked choose between will generally gamble
second set obtained first common number percent number whose presence should no effect preference
thus preference
been demonstrated under many different conditions
real robust phenomenon at least when involves standard large gains
however literature results
present experiments investigate two leading theory predicts common effect should occur but effect not always previously been found
experiment number issue losses while experiment number effects event
number been
theories include theories explain via expected utility theories utility function number outcomes
however present i will two particular classes theories probability theories weight theories
most common weight probabilities outcomes via p function small values p large values p original theory
first pair when common number number percent greater gamble because very section p function p number
thus gamble
when common number both number percent gamble number percent gamble p function
difference between them seems small choose more gamble
under theory p function not applied directly probability outcome but rather probabilities utility outcome probability outcome at least good probability if outcome better than
thus weight given outcome depends not only probability utility outcome itself but also how good outcome relative other possible outcomes gamble
rather than using probabilities weight models directly weight outcome according its rank outcome set outcomes given weight
smaller outcomes more than larger ones weight model people more outcomes than they best outcomes
example model each lower outcome probability weight each higher outcome
model therefore via probability weights risky gamble outcome less than its probability would suggest outcome less outcome more
thus gamble pair gamble probability weight
both two outcomes
thus probability weights similar changes both simply choose better risky gamble
although been demonstrated wide variety gains few studies used losses had results
found greater than losses obtained common amount all outcomes gains
probability theories model predict under conditions
however obtained obtained same manner
three other studies found no either losses gains
thus literature existence losses
moreover no studies i examined effect across rather than
question loss will experiment number
take standard each into three outcomes instead two standard ones
because rank outcome using probability two sets also under therefore predicts should
under original effects depend whether during
if so should standard ones
if not should increase gamble number percent number percent considered larger than number percent risky gamble thus
under model will also increase value gamble outcomes less weight outcome when into two outcomes than when one outcome
at same time value risky gamble when outcome more weight outcome when outcome
thus model predicts should reduce
known event
several studies found event event reduce
although other studies find effect
extent event fundamental
possible simply makes common more out probability outcome could tested does not make common more
effects only one two
found only risky gamble makes common most did not while only gamble did
result against event makes common more
however one two not other still means at least one outcomes across
effect so outcomes may compared not known will examined experiment number
all studies examined losses event past used simple choice technique subjects demonstrate choosing risky gamble gamble
however what important about not preference itself but rather increase risk when common
set two pairs risk preference only if presented if gamble but risky gamble
who risky gamble might well more therefore demonstrate using technique
choice technique if reduction number subjects making pattern choices does actually reduction common effect risk preference been overall
one aim present experiments was examine effects event using matching technique more than choice technique used previous studies
