three experiments investigated preferences reactions negative life
participants had more negative reaction when they were highly negative life experience than when they were two negative events highly negative negative life event
participants also situation two versus one negative event
thus more negative events were better when events had different
when participants were events having similar however two negative events produced more negative reaction
addition participants situation having one versus two negative life
thus more negative events were when events had similar
results consistent s model situations when more negative life events better when more negative life events
results also out several alternative including rule
introduction
more when negative life events
follows behavioral approaches
behavioral addition stimulus context should reduce approach preference
s model demonstrated preferences but not always values associated each event example individuals may not always more negative after event both highly negative negative event than they after highly negative one
model findings judgment
example was found judgment literature when individuals were given cues had values see however our set size effects section number number whereas each impact was seen social influence where participants typically performed task having similar impact similar levels
s model effects not judgment domain effects not social influence domain
rather responses sensitivity values associated each event well central average value events
see quantitative expression model
model was developed provide theoretical account how individuals presence one multiple having levels
