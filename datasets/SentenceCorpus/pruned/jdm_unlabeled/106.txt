introduction
recently one our was
had just little
but i had just
now i like
more money than necessary
when not make one like
people
people show their
others their money up number
people also choose etc
not
but when actions if not more than itself
provides useful framework understanding
if you new pair number
but if you number may
number may
but them you should out more
when you open account you whether resulting outcome was
but does not explain why so
defined two ways
first above person if more money than necessary
second other been
identified several behaviors aversion
even considered so natural
showed moreover even people may make choices their own
too much
too much
people may reduce psychological
however losses not own due e g behavior not
thus people may also additional time effort etc
if only psychological they their money
present study aversion scenarios where not only but well provided one like
study number phenomenon order money was people outcome same result but requires greater effort time therefore
study number results new dependent variables
