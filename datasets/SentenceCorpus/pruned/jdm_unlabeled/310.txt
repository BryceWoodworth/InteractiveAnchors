decision behavior been observed patients
investigated several cognitive mechanisms might bias seen patients biases information integration using process
allows various decision-making processes information environment
total number patients number experiment
although less focused information search patients considered all information showed no sense less evidence
choices patients both rational solution well but patients showed more confidence
both groups used decision strategies information integration only small simple heuristics
under high time however patients strategies less cues more ones were
introduction
decision-making feature patients
certain number
cognitive studies bias not scenarios but situations
while among also patients other studies found bias also patients
recently been found
number researchers fundamental role fixed
been investigated probabilistic task subject presented sequence either contains example contains
events usually strongly one
compared both patients make early decisions number number percent cases i e they after only one been
when presented available information all at group differences
addition probability usually not patients bias rather than probabilistic
our group bias out memory factors
others found bias not result
using experimental who patients current they available amount evidence
nature not under some multiple response options bias may even
different ways
core paper investigate bias less information taken into account decision-making relative predictive value information relative information integration validity cues not considered heuristics more strongly relative
our group recently investigated second found patients decisions so far been investigated context memory tasks
also found patients tend more decisions when asked correct classical especially under other studies role cognitive biases
present study used task confidence information integration single
were especially investigate cue selection patients since feature sources information e g theories
may not problem if most information indeed cognitive research found subjects take best heuristic application heuristic some environments leads good decisions
although task remains standard does not decision-making sequence events
moreover task estimates basis single its
aim was investigate impact scenarios
basis available literature expected patients less number particularly less number information show less information search less information first number their judgments number biases might more under conditions task number compared
following account investigated whether there differences choice accuracy whether subjects particularly rely take best strategy if there relation between measures i e see below different aspects biases
