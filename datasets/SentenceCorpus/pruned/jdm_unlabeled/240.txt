more recently tendency been individual difference
his developed maximization scale contains number items at general tendency e g i relationships like i before i

findings based use scale about been reported major
general characterized group people high options
given strong been about versus based responses maximization scale especially important confidence construct validity measure
suggested maximization scale short
present research therefore was better understand nature construct measured maximization scale propose alternative measure maximization construct
