very small but may sufficient over years
examine effect changes different
making more difficult its about number but range number number percent
given effect possible making less more over extended time would result significant weight loss
introduction
health its been states over recent
health estimate between number number increased number number number number number
increases risk disease type other conditions
although there no health problem
does not two critical properties number not number its growth over time years not s but instead very
most common treatment
yet most studies treatment find
even when weight losses
one review even only rate weight not fact weight question
according weight increased between number but
alternative approach problem not focus individual but rather focus environment
recent years group researchers focus environment control
proposed approach been one form another et al number
estimates increase body weight per been they depending time measured properties sample
based data weight gain estimates number number number number number number number number per
increase could could been very reduction range number number depending many factors including assumptions about energy
thus reduction years number number per number number number per all would growth states
environmental alternative its most common most practical form involves but effects corresponding gains weight
number environmental been shown
environmental influence size
experiments both real world settings increasing size increases
size also been differences field studies
more total than their smaller individual
strongly suggests they than part because they smaller
focus present studies not size but influence choice
number existing studies
most terms i e spatial into effort
early work effort was theory predicted individuals would reduce more than normal weight individuals effort obtain increased
general used studies involved differences effort
showed individuals if they had them while were
showed individuals less than but there was no effect
number showed at were less likely use require more effort than normal weight
another study view was individuals when they do not but study also found no reduction either group versus
other studies testing hypothesis show no differences environmental influence versus normal subjects
showed reduction when they were at four setting
study reported difference between normal weight
also reported when was setting reduced both normal weight individuals
studies framework also show effects effort
et al reported large setting when they were made them some distance main
et al found individuals more while if versus number number
more recently demonstrated more when their at another
potentially ways examples include i e how much what direction one must i e how
work above suggests changes influence
all here were shown effective single
do not know whether people would reduction increased changes energy

present studies explore effects small usually environmental changes
changes called because they less without choice set
hence our i
paper order items real world setting increased items presented at
i e three studies study i e how one another
