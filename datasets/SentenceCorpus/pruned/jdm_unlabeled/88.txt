first strong associations exist between associations data most
moreover natural those humans some significant way tend seen good further associations between attributes

second because estimation task might even related means complex judgments
third might who might also about other aspects more general about attributes
effects more generally suggests might one positive more other attributes even when they not related if so might extent
because natural tend seen good given
although above all point positive effects effects might general

if so people high might more affected positive effects should increase initial here
despite different underlying assumptions all same core prediction might reduce judgments making more goal
present studies test prediction effect perceived well impact perceived need
also explore whether individuals high especially likely show effect consistent above
note however alternative prediction also those high may know more about them less
