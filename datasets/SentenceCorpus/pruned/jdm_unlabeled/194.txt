propose model general decision making
model utility theory theory its treatment multiple suggests several different ways context affect choice
particularly apply model decisions often
among other people against events against allow factors influence other decisions
theory theory explain
apply model above consider many different consider effects context decision rules
paper some individual decision making respect measures
introduction
concept goal aim etc
been long been taken many human behavior
behavior his best order make good first literature etc

despite wide use goal decision utility value basis choice
particular ways increasing utility
utility thought common multiple multiple quantitative attributes outcomes

contrast multiple way different together should
integration multiple idea paper
despite concept single common value across both general decision
concept concept work reward systems brain general all suggest some general quality many different
who decision analysis focus values point rather than goal represented overall utility
decision concept maximization single dimension utility
set real numbers maximum but there no natural total sets vectors two more therefore no natural concept maximization
fact total fundamental most theories decision
idea all human same hypothesis been determine extent its ways
many into well human thought processes especially models
way application mathematical methods
paper more theory decision making where preferences based decision context decision rather than utility
show alternative approach leads new how people make choices novel questions respect theories behavior decision choices
our theory present about
many out were selected view several different at
because often involves several each one more but at may emotional visual up current
often both at financial at emotional
will discuss multiple other below
fundamental structural decision theory
do not consider each each choice
rather decision theory only at behavioral level where what will various possible what designed will likely achieve several important
past research various cognitive
area control particularly evidence sequences
interest very
been considered other theories human
one major together individual decision making into close decision making
latter among individuals groups
new their perceived relationship made often
individual decision their perceived relationship hidden within but one data provide some information about processes
also requires us between
achieve
some money may itself become goal
example between money considered same money considered goal
main our paper decision making
much focus even consider decisions at length
theory much more
however found focus useful theory development
there many decisions individuals
classical utility theory account decision making under risk especially
was not us goal approach would do better than utility theory its popular alternative theory
theory domain been both compared more examples
choices idea designed financial risk situations where many at risk but relatively few actually financial loss
many cases financial risk but difficult if not other
having example even if
may time
cannot others not directly affected although social exist
what most financial risk
each at risk relatively small amount risk
when does amount some cost
instead few cases where financial loss at risk much smaller financial
must large not only total financial losses but also effort
thus usually average losses
terms standard theory people more than expected loss because they
does not lower overall utility level significantly but large financial loss would result very large utility
utility changes much greater than probability loss thus individuals so their expected utility
financial when choices respect appear given risk aversion
example common people obtain low rather than high requires them initial loss
make some not following small whose cost could via low they would lead increased next years they involved their
higher would individuals money before associated whether not
rather different example after program number
against was both high at low rates
yet there was limited interest despite despite potential losses
third example many people more they find very than they negative
if needed then must after loss
cost remains same independent positive negative object
since more than less object
