introduction
human judgment
how people evaluate given target depends how they
example how they their own other frequency
effects might occur because tend use their information judgment process
however influence human judgments not only because they used directly information but also because they more influence how process information
particular who tend process information more heuristic manner whereas those tend process information more
example rely more use other heuristic strategies than
extent use heuristic strategies leads biases findings suggest typically less accurate more than
however there at least one rule
