difference risk preferences being more risky choices robust experimental finding
sources difference recently tendency experience more strongly suggested more strongly about negative outcomes would lead greater
here test hypothesis number number us where questions about
both find about outcomes among effect difference
introduction
why do less risky behaviors than
prior work lower risk preferences less risky behavior robust across variety
particular current work researchers differences financial decisions involving risk
instance less likely than
number structural role theories evolutionary approaches consistent observations
however only recently researchers study underlying mechanisms differences
there several possible differences
first may different probabilities likelihood second may experience different positive negative reactions
recent review literature differences risk preferences research tendency experience emotional reactions outcomes events than
authors tendency experience emotional reactions outcomes may explain differences risk preferences
goal current study address hypothesis using sample
tendency experience emotional reactions would explain differences risky financial decisions whether if compared more strongly b negative predicted decisions about whether
thus predict will differences
but tend experience emotional reactions all outcomes suggested they would also experience positive reactions
positive reactions negative emotional reactions effect decisions
argue much higher probabilities than does not allow positive reactions negative reactions
other words because people know they most likely expected emotional reactions should much predictor decisions them than expected emotional reactions
thus even if do find reactions among only reactions will influence decisions play
results recent study et al consistent hypothesis
using sample researchers measured differences likelihood variety risky behaviors
researchers found most domains negative outcomes more strongly than did
further compared expected negative outcomes occur greater likelihood
finally found evaluation negative outcomes well expected likelihood those outcomes differences risky behaviors
but extent likelihood events cannot know certain whether differences reactions explain differences decisions
thus one goal current make probabilities known measure differences under conditions
below second goal study was test prediction
study section tests using
tend s
thus our allows us test robustness our using two different
prior work differences risk taking found tend less risk than
use hypothesis explain differences times financial need decision rely network help
thus allows more risky behavior
thus might more risk taking among than
most however should predicted differences occur above any differences
