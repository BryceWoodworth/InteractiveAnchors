introduction
world actual state world constraints interactions within
domains judgments how far how high
what correct given
where likely
multiple probabilistic physical world
depends accuracy our judgment how well objective
increasing systems however many environments power well processes judgments decision making within them

nature cues information available also strategies must use make judgments
i make case judgment decision making requires primary strategy achieve process requires analysis
recognition changes research models environments well design systems decision
