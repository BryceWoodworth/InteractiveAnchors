how do individual differences direction particular bias
different individuals biases different
paper effect information processing rate biases occur when two choice questions made up components set different situation behavioral biases
typically two correlated attributes involved number people affected choice option people affected
each two attributes relevant one one judgment
two biases involve some attention each case
biases define them thus different situation discussed bias action bias
cases biases occur same task example some people over action while few others action over
biases requires methods statistical analysis individuals
existence individual differences heuristic been demonstrated variety biases
include risk perception risk binary heuristic
however studies heuristic biases use statistics hypothesis number participants cognitive biases each group cannot due
suggest individual who one direction bias not less exhibit its bias
specifically argue individual differences information processing together factors play important role rate biases general will thus affect both biases
previous research shown relation several measures information processing judgments
example reported individual differences heuristic responses
responses were found correlated rational
identified need effects i e way information presented
people who low need were more affected effects
found decision-making need were correlated complexity representation decision task
moreover individual differences information processing may work several factors decision process
example two factors according performance errors random processes lack attention memory alternative task where participants task way one point view perspective
thus way people process information dependent their individual processing but also factors change different types attributes
same proposed processing information model explain variety biases
according model decision process individuals complex attributes although might choice at hand attributes may correlated more relevant ones
process behavioral biases often result attributes attributes
example when individuals required risk level they often tend attributes data about real statistical correlation between rely instead attributes more difference between
thus factors change given each process direction
based argue individual information processing likely determine attributes aspects will process ones will used
rational information processing seems rather clear
based previous research individuals who low rational assumed more different types biases
since people also more affected i e way information presented they more use alternative tasks
they expected show behavioral biases when components set different situation
however much less clear when consider
while behavior often considered result low tendency rational high tendency relevant attributes attributes recent data suggest some situations highly leads well judgments take into account different attributes according their importance rather
more recent studies may between rational systems
specifically highly rational participants tend active information search often leads selection more relevant attributes during decision process
most relevant attributes via high rational may value lead less decisions individuals high
thus another goal current paper examine proposed between judgment contrast more account leads more judgments
