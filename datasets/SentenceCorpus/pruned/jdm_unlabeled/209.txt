note number attention issue specifically studies number problem examples judgment literature number provide simple method power regression analyses order type errors when regression models used
introduction
judgment used multiple regression model cognitive underlying many types judgments variety
most often models individual decision multiple information cues manner at judgment
further analyses those who judgment task their judgment model policy although less than consistency
ability linear regression models judgments under various conditions been discussed
if one people's judgments though they multiple regression questions number how many available cues does individual use
number how should number cues used determined
too many researchers apply statistical tests did did not specific cues
if weight significant then cue being
p values way problem because values affected number cues number cases presented during task how well overall regression total set responses
issue discussed note follows first examples judgment literature existence problem
second used judgment when regression introduced
third using method power regression based t distribution described
method applied estimate number cases necessary statistical order how about number cues judgment task should type error
finally program described provided
