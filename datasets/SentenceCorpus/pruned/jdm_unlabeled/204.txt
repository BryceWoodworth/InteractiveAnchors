introduction
most applications standard models whether individual decision making make basic assumption each risky game considered resulting choice should based only attributes particular game
validity related assumptions been past especially context individual decision making under risk
thus first demonstrated behavior expected utility theory here between possible outcomes
later regret theory showed how regret utility outcome results particular choice depending outcomes would other choices choice set
recent psychological theories individual decision making also been developed relation one another stochastic difference model decision field theory model
theories all common idea presence option choice set may change way another option more preferences options each situation recent past
thus preference rather than revealed

similar effects were also found financial decision making under risk
