effect probability outcome higher following action outcome than action
paper evaluate hypothesis effect due control situation
require action make difference outcome action outcome
if control then actions make difference occur prior outcome should most strongly
experiments number number whether action makes difference temporal order action outcome
experiment number tested whether action if all outcomes negative
results all four experiments our hypothesis effect depends sense control
introduction
shown taking action making decision certain state world make state more likely even when action decision no real impact
example people at increases probability will
argue occurs because action good outcome leads regret therefore attention negative outcome
negative outcome then seems more likely because more available
paper hypothesis conditions
our not outcome makes more likely
rather belief action will influence outcome control
further argue control depends role action outcome
understand control more than taking action one about outcome when fact outcome due
take term control more general any between action outcome including possible action outcome
our use term control relation between variables not states variables
agent will control over outcome only if agent at some level his action relation outcome
certain between actions outcomes
first action outcome action must make difference outcome
second action must outcome
people highly therefore propose they experience when there cues environment they should their actions specifically action potential make difference action outcome
actions no real impact outcome question does not influence whether will
however actions affect way depends outcome
instance decision at determine whether one
argue actions function choice outcome likely because action leads sense control
contrast actions do not directly influence will not
use term choice outcome determine
temporal another fundamental property one people highly
used principle provide evidence control choices game
they compared behavior games where had chosen but what they was unknown cases where had not chosen yet
people were more likely if their had not chosen yet even though their own choice was unknown
suggests decision-making was belief at some level choice could influence even though was unknown
will if outcome been determined even if one knowledge outcome
our hypothesis predicts one should when choice makes difference outcome not yet been determined
first study both whether choice makes difference temporal order outcome decision test prediction
second study first using different rule out alternative
third study extended
study examined whether choice must make difference
