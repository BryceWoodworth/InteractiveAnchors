present article methods used between regret new method regret scale two decision making research
validity was tested three studies
study number used two scenarios one regret other test compare methods how much regret do you how much do you
results showed only between regret
study number validity both regret could
study number also demonstrated between regret results similar those obtained using scale
study number showed over methods situations used decision making research provided evidence validity
introduction
impact our they our behavior their influence so no decision theory could complete without taking their role into account
example typically experience after having made decision leads good outcome us
tend experience negative even when had made better decision
other at very decision made our choices
most studied decision regret one after better outcome could been obtained had one
experience regret depends choice its relation alternatives
been relation between regret choice since early number there now general influence regret decision making
specifically regret increase certain alternatives
same process also function health behavior computer behavior
although less empirical focus effects regret been more
example some studies shown regret also game
other authors however found regret lower impact than generally assumed
also based when find events world had out better us
yet although regret different they both generated comparing what what might been
regret results comparison between actual outcome better outcome might had another option been chosen choice
comparison actual outcome better outcome might had world events
