present research investigated relationship between individual differences versus i e make single best choice rather than choice good interaction individual
data three distinct groups s n number n number n number were
results showed where choice i e s reported less than difference was regret
however was
although was associated more regret regret had no relationship
patterns also individual scale although difference between s high
where individual choice highly considered regret over choices factor whereas much less place less choice way
introduction
choice individual decision making highly
greater choice provide two types
first find what they
their
various studies recently choice may at does not always health
options within domain choice several problems may
first process complete information about options makes more
second options people's what outcome
people may any result their because so many options they no not one
however more options there more likely one does not choose best option
problems become especially relevant where people options all domains life
people about their life decisions because they about whether they making choices according p number increase people's their even
however not may problems choice
been people who always outcomes their choices most negative effects too much choice
people options because make they choose optimal option all information about each alternative considered often difficult even
moreover there likely best option been especially when not been possible consider all options
hence potential regret present because there always there better option out there find means
other hand people approach choices using good strategy any option certain threshold considered
approach choice individual does not consider all information about each option what more several options do not depend number options because more options does not good option
moreover there no but not option when good approach choice
et al found stable individual differences people's tendency use either good strategy strategy
people either been latter group expected more problems choice
indeed various studies showed experience higher levels regret compared they show lower levels decisions lower levels more generally
