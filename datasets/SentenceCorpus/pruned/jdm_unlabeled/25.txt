principle loss aversion thought explain wide range involving between losses gains
article i show loss aversion was introduced risky effect characterized not only loss gain but between change towards latter sufficient explain
moreover i show two basic psychological number behavior number preferences tend existence robust fundamental
thus loss aversion principle account was introduced explain
introduction
research shown people tend evaluate outcomes not terms their impact resulting state but terms changes reference state
moreover evidence been people loss negative changes i e losses reference state thought larger than positive changes i e gains
principle loss aversion considered most robust important finding behavioral decision theory been widely phenomenon
literature where loss aversion been account effect based explain people's small even
literature loss aversion been widely account effect effect observed
principle loss aversion was first introduced account finding experimental subjects required over expected value even gain loss risky
principle was extended context choice term effect finding object appear value object more than object
instance one series effect experiments found required significantly more money part their number than were number
et al result loss aversion loss larger than gain
bias tendency at loss aversion assumed loss option larger than gain alternative option
instance one empirical bias showed individuals choice task were more likely choose particular option out four when option was presented i e when they were money was option
principle so principle loss aversion not derived any theory behavior more basic psychological but principle introduced account range involving between losses gains context classical choice
psychological theory account loss aversion situation loss aversion associated loss gain e g effect bias risky same evidence existence loss aversion
not loss aversion potentially psychological basis
indeed number researchers underlying psychological mechanism could explain loss gain
psychological mechanisms loss aversion include impact losses greater than gains people's attention focused losses more than gains studies either loss gain
common feature psychological mechanism loss aversion fundamental loss gain fact exists explain
contrast present research i do not explain existence loss gain but notion necessary explain at all
particular i most evidence loss bias effect risky characterized not only loss gain but between change towards latter sufficient explain
moreover i show two basic psychological number behavior number preferences tend existence robust fundamental
thus at e not simply alternative account loss aversion but one introduction loss aversion principle
article follows first i discuss nature behavior preferences at
i compare account loss aversion account bias effect risky
i existence basic behavioral tendency over change loss aversion principle account was introduced explain principle should therefore
