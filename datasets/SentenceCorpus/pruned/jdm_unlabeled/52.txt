introduction
decisions expected result outcomes do complex problems complex strategies
extent difficult choices simple strategies been decision research
one choice inference strategies recognition heuristic
simply if one two objects other not then object higher value
thus when asked greater person who only one use recognition heuristic though person who both must make their choice some other way
when rate frequency value heuristic will lead choice inference accuracy above levels
thus our example positive between means recognition heuristic should some validity choice question
recent analysis shows recognition may even though leads some previously seen objects
if objects more likely associated relevant characteristics environment than ones will predictive power recognition
paper examine application recognition heuristic decisions where one many possible made
here recognition heuristic when set objects larger set choose subset objects
why might people use heuristic
first some situations they may expressed previous
makes sense many people they more than those they they will make
there when number whose only
generally people know will recognition
there may other when about recognition more processes may choices
people stimuli more so when they previously presented stimuli at better than levels not prior
suggests preference may adaptive stimuli situations greater potential risk than ones do
people also more i e more stimuli often base their how objects events
although not distinct recognition may more less available but simply not
stimuli more more available than ones average more too
features could explain why choice may occur even when conditions make effective strategy certain unknown
use recognition heuristic been subject several empirical
reported heuristic people make correct when task two had greater population
some experimental observation also been additional samples
objects associated stable characteristics true answer memory will usually not change many years
example correct answer question larger
been same different future
dynamic domains events where accuracy over time
instance likely though not certain
furthermore there may time when highly will basis unknown
been shown recognition some extent predict outcome events
paper recognition heuristic using important but difficult
task also associated variable characteristics so provides test recognition heuristic
et al found recognition basis
people they among new
most than number percent participants over number
possible recognition data four participants across each two distinct
only recognition s did
was general advantage highly was when people were most e using recognition data where recognition rates were lower than
simple strategy should prove effective was therefore attention among financial efficient hypothesis cannot simple strategies
et al provide some their results instance features size may all associated both recognition limited recognition best ability recognition heuristic
simply other features recognition also tend up value
hence will higher average than ones
if individual few they only whose size made them good
however important question whether mechanism could
et al results sample recognition data us
both et al discuss recognition may not good strategy when often observed perform
model predicts et al finding more likely than
points out only those they
value will tend higher widely
however theory predicts will highly will lower recognition heuristic should
consistent effect more widely
effect even when size may effect
need information order predict future
less information greater important information predicts changes value
however information e g will less therefore more than high levels recognition detailed basis
therefore order require risk their their increased effort information about those
risk aversion would make potentially risky relatively unknown expected
contrast will more they obtain sufficient information able against risk losses
several studies examined factors affect recognition
many found effect upon value consistent
instance showed had previously high had been recent
strategy was shown
provide some into why might strategy features
they found people tend they less risky than those they
more direct tests theory focus among number recognition
predictions et al found low levels recognition predicted low
however showed changes do indeed predict current value predict future when value over time
others who examined its recognition
increases recognition will often result increases might some no particular they previously
studies reported here direct measure recognition simply sample people whether they
thus recognition considered at level individual potential rather than at level large
use data whether simple recognition form basis strategy
particular two questions how well et al findings considered
were their results simply function random variation only particular time
end our studies at different time points value over time
will see despite being at us test recognition heuristic detailed et al findings under variety conditions
et al findings only particular populations participants
thus one recognition strategy selection simply recognition data better than average
issue examine recognition data participants three
all number number possible could some examined more than one study recognition data different samples participants at different points time
us test recognition heuristic over range recognition rates typically high low
many important order determine whether there might any general effect over
although et al report between not independent
instance there was some always given
two key findings et al data number overall validity recognition method selection number increased recognition more participants lower levels recognition
note not whether actually use recognition whether if they did would effective
