research towards processing differences means understanding likelihood effect
current study how differences processing may through across individuals
predicted during participants would exhibit effects whereas effects would relatively during
individuals part study findings our hypothesis pattern risk across number cycle
introduction
most studied examples risk decision making its theory
according theory outcome either loss gain amount risk person
effect due differences perceived subjective value value function
function gains leads preferences convex losses leads preference risky alternatives
most well known example effect participants disease will potentially number people
then asked choose between two alternatives disease
one alternative contains certain outcome e g number people certain other likelihood outcome e g number number probability all number people will number number probability no one will
alternatives presented either people people
both alternatives contain same expected outcome numerical
people tend choose certain risk free option when problem risky option when
while effect number studies processing differences factor effect
one most widely investigated factors research
extent people thought how much they so
thus individuals high levels should process tasks more whereas individuals low should use less effort
research shown effects individuals who high
similar results were found when high was combined ability processing
related research shown influence likelihood effects
other research shown task either high low importance should lead more less processing likelihood effects
overall findings studies tend show when more effort involved task effect one
similar approach research theory shown when greater like memory used effects robust whereas when more effects less
recent shown support means understanding effects
one ability factor been identified complex information
research shown low individuals more sources information i e they been shown demonstrate effects
another individual difference variable used cognitive test show effects were people more processing more robust people using more processing
similar findings were reported
other research shown ability differences may influence effect
one study found individuals relatively higher cognitive ability measured were less likely exhibit effects
later research shown memory also role effects but exact nature role not been defined
recently however their original assumptions larger study their findings call their prior effects into question
taken together findings how effects differ across individuals situations
type processing involved important choices people make
findings suggest effects will less likely when person being more involved decision task
variety factors may influence effort processing person uses
