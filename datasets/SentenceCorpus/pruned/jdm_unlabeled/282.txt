examined relation cognitive performance tasks distinct predicting
found significant between cognitive all estimation measures tasks
our results suggest cognitive more characteristics than proposed
proposed cognitive related concept
cognitive knowledge heuristics characteristics environment may play essential role adaptation decision different environments situations
introduction
humans often statistics expected utility theory other models rational decision making
instead making decisions judgments based those models humans tend use heuristics lead them errors biases
not all humans some them perform if they use models
studies shown cognitive related
article investigate role cognitive decision making
defined cognitive ability response first number developed cognitive test order measure
also proposed more general cognitive based theories
theories propose humans two cognitive systems system number processes heuristic system number processes
based system number identified two characteristics system number related cognitive its system number its system number
research shown individual differences play role decisions judgments tasks where their behavior could compared predictions models
those studies found was related choices predicted expected utility theory risky choice tasks
note however also found domain gains high more risky options than low even when expected value risk option was lower than option
choice showed was related options i e high had lower rates than low et al found almost significant difference same direction
furthermore et al found high were better than low at also they were less
article three related cognitive number do individual differences cognitive measured influence behavior decision-making tasks those accuracy measured criterion rather than consistency number does measure only ability response first
does also measure number does general knowledge account influence cognitive decision making
does cognitive influence decision making general knowledge
tasks those test world
example number compared actual number
theoretical interest tasks good performance them typically use heuristics not
far present study first one cognitive measured decision-making tasks
previous research shown high heuristic behavior tasks investigate judgments but not whether judgments world
found high performance was related more heuristic search
based results predicted cognitive performance would related tasks use heuristics
second investigated was whether only measures response suggested also measures decision making
if case cognitive measured would more general concept
third was alternative role decision-making tasks
since different types general knowledge e g could relation between decision making individual differences general knowledge
tested using tasks did not require
