when probability event many people less likely when expressed small numbers e g number number than when expressed large numbers e g number number
four experiments show phenomenon increased experimental subjects aim task
one factor constant across experiment number number particular subjects them about outcome target event rather than rational answer
question experiment number explicitly subject third option experiment number number one between two options
experiment number task only third option simply option allows subjects correct answer
introduction
phenomenon occurs when people event less likely more when its probability presented form smaller e g number number versus larger e g number number numbers
phenomenon robust special interest because seems demonstrate many people despite better certain situations according their
phenomenon seems provide evidence existence two independent processing each other often manner
experimental game subjects two one large e g number out number one small e g number out number they
when two probabilities rational decision report no preference
however most subjects larger number many despite they know better small money so rather than having selection made
subjects were how they most people would how they they themselves would
according authors behavior more because present themselves rational people
bias been investigated health domain et al
subjects rates both rate population per number number number people within subjects
risk were higher number number than number actual rate
et al investigated bias context choices between given probability
many studies presented subjects choice between number number number number well choice between number number number number
they found many individuals number percent number percent latter choice large even though small greater probability
existence bias also been studies testing effect
recent study risky judgments also provides support effect over theory level theory
given number people cancer every number number people cancer every level theory predicts will result higher risk judgments whereas effect predicts higher risk judgments latter
study showed bias effect seems level theory when two compared although subjects show effect
