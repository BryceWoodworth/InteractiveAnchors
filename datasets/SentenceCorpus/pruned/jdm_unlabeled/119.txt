about via contact may when people mechanisms their appropriate
do people knowledge mechanisms
previous work shown very being close source asked whether same also judgments
two studies measured object had made contact source object had made no contact object far had also made no contact
showed clear effect objects source were perceived less than those far even though group could not made contact either object study number
effect also robust when third group was explicitly no had made contact objects at any time study number
discuss our findings effects contact principle understanding theories despite theories work
introduction
people often their about world more recently learned theories
example people may belief directly
although research revealed alternative mechanisms e g transmission people may their initial belief
perspective our theories critical examine because although they often they still strongly influence our behaviors
instance people's patients despite knowledge cannot via contact theories
general may when people's core knowledge assumptions about major domains other domains situations
example about correct within biological domain psychological domain behaviors consistent belief person properties objects
most domain knowledge effect people objects had into even contact source
example person
there no real yet even when any physical e g via people object
studies demonstrated several key features states objects contact always contact
first people though physical contact critical properties second characterized even most contact amount properties then other objects third characterized relative long time after contact
showed contact central effect
current studies asked whether also about sources even complete contact effect
given contact effect distinct contact always contact
theory existence effect highly if effect mechanisms previously
effect if obtained could known mechanisms situations
there some prior evidence very though just being
one study example one several about who
their physical contact first into was their was but made contact
most number number their study only physical contact
contrast significant number number their study also effect
given between groups effect researchers generally effect knowledge very may mechanisms
indeed there been little no evidence suggest experiments effect been who know correct mechanisms
if even most contact source was would still though occurs
whether show knowledge about open question
one theories been more theories
may only specific learned cases scenarios
example may scenarios real life explicitly learned despite their
our study used scenarios even would not increasing our ability measure their responses
previously only reported evidence effect both using described scenarios upon found had e g either next
however study was very whether contact had before them e g could prior making
critical problem given work principle shown even point contact still contact following
therefore remains unknown whether would show true effect they while its was
studies using tasks cannot tests effect
tasks second then first so total number judgments made each
studies showed judgments close
however contact at each point
therefore about second second made physical contact first first
judgments task demonstrated its e g physical contact but task does not clear test effect
finally study people like cannot having shown effect
although no contact was involved study was effect tested
study there was no object could
et al instead designed study test distinct known similarity e g if like must also some other properties
study similarity but does not indeed was address contact always contact effect
thus new was needed test effect
current studies used was clear contact had
they asked participants rate having contact objects had previously had contact different sources
current work task participants having contact objects had been different sources
contact source was critical conditions measure effect
