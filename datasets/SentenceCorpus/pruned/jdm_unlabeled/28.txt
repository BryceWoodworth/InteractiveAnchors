series recent experiments matching generate significantly higher than do
paper experiment examine whether higher relative preference matching
some potential policy effects also considered
introduction
play large role social developed
effort find ways experimental recent years attention effects alternative mechanisms
one general program effects different methods
series recent experiments matching higher than do
design experiments one more games similar those used where participants make decisions under different conditions
however rather than directly experiments subjects make decisions under various matching conditions effective
number design used control treatment many ways
subjects asked make series decisions themselves number under conditions shown number
must
after making their choices one selected decision
decision subject amount they conditions
amount matching matching conditions
general matching s effective number p number number s s effective number p numbers
thus s s same effective when s s number s
however observed higher under matching than under
example were high under number percent matching shown problem number number than under number percent condition shown problem number
control treatment results previously reported
also report very similar results alternative where subjects make decisions field
addition their control treatment report information treatment where subjects information them about their choices
information only reduced but did not significant differences
why so remains
part subjects understand task at hand results
simple subjects report very high levels understanding
example subjects strongly were clear
using number point scale mean subject response was number number
one possible higher under matching people find about matching
suggest effect might support preference matching knowledge also under matching may subjects increases relative rewards
at least some find
effects discussed may explain higher generated matching
notion effects related but distinct well known concept suggests when given problem people tend problem focus only those components they control most directly affect them most directly
example given problems shown number people may focus direct their rather than themselves various conditions
observed similar result when they asked subjects make series among
when asked subjects among despite very
when asked subjects use rule even though time rule very
subjects information about their decisions reduced but did not tendency make presented
preferences matching effects distinct policy
if people simply matching might do well feature matching
particular matching program would increase however extent effects explain higher generated matching may program even if may not find program increases
both potential what people may direct effects
example combination matching higher might difficult since people may focus direct negative increase rather than more positive increased
matching program would increase over current policy only if people more increased matching than other possible attention reduction
potential importance effects remains subject future
paper experiment task between preference matching effects effects
idea experiment
addition control treatment using design shown number i maximum possible treatment where decisions so problem dimension presented most directly subjects maximum amount may rather than maximum amount subject may take
although terms few natural allows between simple preferences matching effects extent subjects simply matching matching will higher than both control
other hand extent subjects amount presented under matching will those under only control treatment
treatment will increase both matching because subjects will maximum possible between themselves same way all conditions
i observations following hypothesis i state alternative form
hypothesis effects previously observed effects
direct effect amount maximum amount may increased matching over
way experimental results consistent effects
paper follows
section number experimental design used evaluate hypothesis
section number experimental results
section some potential policy effects
