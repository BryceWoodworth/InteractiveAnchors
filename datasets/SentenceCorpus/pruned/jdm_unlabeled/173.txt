introduction
effect tendency people like more result greater degree prior more effect
been most studied since his initial studies been found robust been demonstrated different
example demonstrated words was positive objects
studies found effects also influence people
other been shown affect preference
often been observed studies where individual increases how they
effective even when stimuli presented
effect been shown affect
found both were associated
et al analysis greater
they were suggested greater may result being perceived more
part at level et al proposed context may
most studies effect within setting
even studies at where seems data should available at population level limited themselves
may due difficulty how prior well variables influence way individuals
example those who more likely more making them more
however prior well estimated
some close strong represented
place over during time they thought best
within after each its points number number number number various cannot their own
since number used system
number number there was single during first were all
second had seen those had through while they were who
since number there been two all four main financial determine who will appear number number
show people more likely their own
phenomenon means will more who same their own
both allow estimates estimates would very achieve most studies
at data number number found those higher than those had not
although was due likely had were higher standard than those did not would been out
result difficult any whether effect actually at work context
been subject much number studies been at way tend within determined
identified patterns particularly more
addition found presence population all influence way their points
some factors quality though others natural they including
other studies found less affected factors than appear later tend more points
current study whether effect also
although been previously account quality means still open question
rather than simply comparing were those were not study only at participants who via
assumed will more those same their own they will more likely them
