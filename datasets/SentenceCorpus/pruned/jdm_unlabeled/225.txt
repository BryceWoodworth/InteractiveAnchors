introduction
known part d into effect s help them their
other health provided part d not provided directly but rather
directly while certain aspects program
one design large number available
most states more than number choose
while reported program they also program too
indeed when family number asked what they thought about d program number percent number percent number percent too
one might therefore about large choice
long idea choice
recent research however question basic assumption too much choice reduce quality decision decision
field cognitive processing could potentially affect ability process information make decisions set out study how natural process may choice set size decision quality
part d was used basis task because its current real world decision-making
specifically study examined relationship between number drug choices available effect ability make objective subjective decisions
