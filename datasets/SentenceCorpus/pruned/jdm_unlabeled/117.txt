three experiments tested if individuals show choices between risky
binary probability higher better value higher value lower
each design two factors third fixed
using same values different
allow one determine if model describe more than one design using same parameters
addition two experiments tested critical property all models
very few people showed only one person out number showed two could
however person did other participants
most individuals showed assumptions stochastic choice responses
means should evaluate models respect response patterns response rather than choice
introduction
theories risky decision making into two groups those preference those do not
preference assumption if person b b c then person should c random error
use number b preference so property follows number b b b number b c number d number number b c
theories represent each gamble single number
theories assume number b b number d number greater than where numerical values two
expected utility theory theory attention model well many other theories class theories
theories represent choice terms between components alternatives however need not preference
theories include family models heuristic regret theory stochastic difference model others
