some studies found choices become more risk after gains more risk after losses although other studies found
latter tend use cases
current study examined effects prior gains losses task designed less decision making task
participants decision-making task one group money whereas other group money
participants who prior loss more risky choice behavior than subjects who prior gain
effects were not positive negative affect although sample size may been too small small effect
introduction
people often risk gains risk losses
whether people consider their choice loss gain dependent their point reference
reference point often current position key role theory choice
should possible domain gain loss actual prior gains losses
people may see their point before gain loss reference point
if they had money example they may see new domain losses they therefore might risk
studies effect gains losses show results
found they called money effect although their participants would take gain all their loss
review literature find some conditions support theory prediction
their result however most results consistent theory studies use more situations rather than tasks
some studies theories decision-making assume decision-making based scenarios people various choices against each other base their decision outcome comparison
choices characterized
however some recent psychological studies decision-making show decisions also less choices often based
recently et al made clear between two psychological systems involved decision-making emotional system involves activation processes system involving processes each having neural
present apply recent knowledge risk aversion
risk aversion after gains people's decisions risk
case risk aversion people's current reference point leads them less risky options without all outcome scenarios
present study examined role reference point task designed emotional decision-making task
during participants four range probability rewards
our hypothesis risk aversion necessary explain some
participants choose usually up number times between four
two e g b
they produce large gains but gains large losses leading overall loss long
other e g c d
gains but consistent losses small
leads gains long
means people who risk would choose b leading losses long
people who risk will choose c d leading overall gain
means risk aversion into better performance overall gains whereas risk would into performance overall losses
psychological process people's behavior our hypothesis risk aversion not only based all outcome scenarios
general people at some point towards certain rather way
whether behavior still subject see et al
behavior seen form learning behavior changes before people why they do what they
therefore decision-making processes
addition our central test relative risk another goal
studies theories decision-making often rely situations choices participants without any real
although use real often not outcome experiments using real important role play quality experimental data
present study point using real order decision-making more
present study experimentally reference point
participants first performed they either money result their performance they had no influence gains losses
note experimental close situations reference point real perceived often result their prior choices
known individual differences influence behavioral decision-making
individual difference variables include reward sensitivity
previous research expected our experimental would effect affect
more prior gain would increase positive affect whereas loss would result increase negative affect
been suggested affect might influence decision-making
positive affect increased sensitivity losses
present study investigated whether individual differences affect may additional effect decision-making
main hypothesis was people who prior gain task performed better i e made more choices risk aversion compared who prior loss
furthermore asked whether effect was subjective affect various other individual differences
