introduction
between approaches decision making long been considered important decision making literature
when decision find best possible solution comparing available alternatives based preferences
when contrast decision find solution important minimum i e option good rather than best
et al attention interest when individuals differ their global versus decision making
new scale was measure individual tendency was presented
based analysis scale less life less lower
also more regret well more social comparison than
due high regret
increased choice were also represent particular who would explore all possible find difficult make choice
previous research problems related increased choice possible decision should make learn good rather than best well about what they
research several key results et al studies identified other negative
example findings suggest associated life outcomes less behavioral greater others more decision
et al if relationships then importance decision making well order obtain better outcomes
research associated et al scale well practical decision scale was introduced several groups
some groups original version scale while other groups items version based items
any subjects based their original scale whether scale was presented original version
all but very few subjects reported approaches most tasks items scale
yet based et al theoretical many subjects reported they indeed considered themselves
however many items scale were seen too too set
subjects also many items situations were them
feedback many items scale not general terms not relevant measure differences individual tendency across samples settings
construct validity scale also been among others
et al consistency important characteristics maximization all items scale should one factor
however et al scale three distinct several items produce relatively factor
there been literature validity construct factor structure scale well proposed less than
et al findings less than need core construct
based individual tendency general tendency identification optimal alternative et al presented several alternative measures
et al scale produced significantly higher decision making behaviors regret than several et al alternative measures including their scale
also factor structure validity et al scale several short scale were tested using datasets different populations
results solution et al
et al first dimension preference alternative search i e even better options
second dimension was decision difficulty i e decision perceived difficulty choosing making decisions
third dimension was taken represent decision tendency high themselves their
et al along same et al need consistency measurements construct
however although several short et al scale useful when three their correlation other variables
et al therefore three should examined future research there need whether all only one two three represent components construct
research reported et al et al suggests individual tendency associated several fundamental problems need order research area
view interest et al article relatively few studies report empirical findings based original scale scale so far
important include study search strategies individual differences decision making decision making outcomes versus analysis
studies reported here was
first lack when et al scale new population was scale testing original new items across several new large samples
second was previous studies individual tendency
into may better decision making
development testing across subjects settings important practical well theoretical
scale factor structure validity would future research
develop scale may also improve our understanding core construct development better
attention et al research also scale high interest high potential value decision who improve their decision making
