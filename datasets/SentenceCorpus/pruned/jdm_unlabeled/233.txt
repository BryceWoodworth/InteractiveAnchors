study judgments actions among populations both groups people's
findings suggest among all groups general patterns what was was not considered were similar
however there were also some significant differences influence being two samples than groups influence being population related
whole almost no significant differences were found any new
introduction
often play important role people's choices decisions
people some their own out others
evidence consistent also been studies involving both responses scenarios decisions real payoffs
although there little empirical evidence one way other judgments might well differ among different populations
suggests there no particular unique norm but one several might depending context
even though there may within given about how example should distributed there may differences between them
although past studies shown nature importance how people they all been
very little evidence been reported people's
although reported responses some questions comparing results one those differences might subject some
suggested et al differences same differences
one present study three their responses all four types compare their judgments those people different
i choose p
comparison using common
since study based used because was over two provides limited comparison judgments over time chosen sample its having much more common than terms level development
further judgments also made between populations between
findings among all groups generally similar ways
there however some differences particularly between those both
all studies were based responses same questions involving simple used their early study among
questions tests example extent people response conditions when were were not making normal
questions terms were useful influence reference what was found important role reference people's judgments often independent particular actions
research empirical literature patterns people's judgments much based not only methods but findings what people actions what they study
et al example used questions similar those study populations
their findings were much same terms negative responses use
investigated people states some questions similar those used
some relatively differences similar patterns judgments were found between
both groups considered increase response finding large consistent findings
general findings showed consistent results
however although how people some other evaluate various they limited were some time
they provide little direct evidence how people other might similar questions given present interest particularly people p

some related studies been out but they used other methods populations
example found judgments those random sample power
while difference between may well limited particular sample population
another study used different sample people about life rather than about common behaviors while useful studies decisions special groups sample questions allow little present studies
latter studies involved more generally populations questions actions decisions power gains previous reference
present study also literature human judgments some empirical evidence used test existing related theories
present study compared might differ social aspects
due differences between comparison difference factor was
however provided some evidence role people's behavior might more significant than factors
order explore influence difference they comparison used control sample because its similarity systems social level development
they found no significant differences people's behavior game between but people two samples influence factors
thus between group two see number including power distance proposed expected play critical role people's judgments
hypothesis number number class hypothesis number number end people people judgments some actions
more people same action than their
hypothesis number based
seen number group along each higher power distance while lower
according large power distance large extent less within power distributed people generally fact power basic fact good its
contrast high associated norm group individuals group provides
study people whose actions all scenarios power more less at same time most them represent group
so theories power distance predict would more decisions groups hypothesis number
however two each other people's judgments
compared less consistent hypothesis number but more thus should less likely
made propose alternative hypothesis number
hypothesis number b number class hypothesis number b number end more people same action than their
many much attention thus studies differences
study also examined whether people's judgments three new
findings some studies judgments social preference revealed might differ each other respect
judgments example significant differences where perceived significantly less across all scenarios both
so i differences exist
hypothesis number number class hypothesis number number end differ their judgments each three
