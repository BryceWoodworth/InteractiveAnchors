using model framework proposed theory explain nature source cognitive between judgment tasks
early review potential approach example understanding structure cognitive effect task person variables judgment policy change
however our number present demonstrate research cognitive using model while research task
there also been less theoretical
discuss possible suggest ways model research cognitive recent theoretical field judgment decision making
introduction
was during cognitive history when proposed between judgment tasks could cognitive thus making examine values social might do
theory how cognitive could within model framework well experimental methods researchers could use study nature source between judgment tasks
cognitive differences how solution problem
instance different may different judgment problem terms information they rely
how apply their judgment also lead
thus according theory make judgment same task could because they principle they different how solve problem practice they application their
while cognitive different value differences among cognitive differences into
under underlying cognitive differences very difficult
early review research using theory psychological potential approach our understanding cognitive both real world settings
despite since time theory little field judgment decision making
example review theories field provide only theory when judgment research
need theories including cognitive seems characterized where other about level how characterized towards greater use alternative
fact theory cognitive could recent theoretical field
instance researchers shown individuals likely use simple process models when judgment tasks factors may affect how individuals make judgments
addition researchers new tools environments computer simulations when judgment behavior
our goal evaluate evolution theory its present
specifically consider how research cognitive developed terms its theoretical review findings empirical research cognitive
our goal focus our cognitive directly related model framework
review theories research more generally not within present paper
article into three main
first consider theory its experimental early research findings
second number present evolution theory cognitive research central number number
finally discuss future theory cognitive research theoretical field
will future researchers
