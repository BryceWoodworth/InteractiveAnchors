previous research events judgment tasks events decisions experience
current paper three experiments field study explore pattern
results suggest pattern
part difference between two effect although negative choice behavior positive
similar pattern observed field study following i e people risk negative but at same time exhibit more behavior positive
difference consistent two well mechanisms judgment error use small samples choice
choice model discussed
introduction
studies human reaction low probability events difference between judgment decision-making settings
judgments probability appear events
estimated probability events occur probability below number number higher than objective probability
other hand decision-making experience events
if events occur probability below number number occur smaller probability than their objective probability
important choice model choice predicted estimated probabilities
