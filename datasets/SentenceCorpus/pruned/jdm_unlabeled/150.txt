introduction
recent studies identified following effect individuals significantly less binary either number number probability than they number
uncertainty effect not only also important current theories at through utility function predict risky should no lower than value their possible outcome
indeed although been literature generally been models because patterns
first paper demonstrate did so across number different both real effect does not features particular
specifically was outcomes e g number one work task studies using choice rather than e g number number number either number number real world situations actual
out number alternative authors resulting direct mechanism uncertainty per directly utility risky
other words uncertainty about outcome one will makes less
support direct mechanism original finding et al out two additional alternative
first found was observed even when participants condition number were better outcome number rules out better outcome may one
second demonstrated participants was not few who did not rules out effect observed simply because participants task
basis aversion uncertainty per i e direct likely
there however at least two alternative been previous research
first involves aversion people may value less because potential not better two outcomes
example number may than number because individual they did not number
thus may result values between better outcomes rather than uncertainty itself
alternative experimentally direct mechanism value better outcome
according models amount should when both outcomes increase their difference
if not better two outcomes effect should at least when outcomes their perceived value e g one two each number
if however uncertainty about outcome one will then effect should despite values
alternative was examined experiment number
second may participants less because they just general aversion term
might case because some people consider against their
moreover state typically expected value less than into
result participants may term because real world typically signal negative expected value
