social preferences often requires one various social maximization social
propose novel theory people's level relative their social thus their social preferences
context decision active processes produce social outcomes
decision not involved outcomes
therefore comparison between others highly them they settings their outcome
decision who take action influence social outcomes more about outcomes more social
report studies testing hypothesis
participants were presented scenarios involving outcomes themselves another person
each outcome was fixed while outcome other person
task was their other person either same outcome their own better one
found participants who were involved outcomes condition were more other better option than were participants who were not involved condition
even low levels influence outcomes were sufficient strong effect occur
discuss hypothesis relation theories social preference effects decision processes policy
introduction
following
after new you find out same
you consider might less than you so you how much
would you rather find out same you less
two reactions might
particular you might outcome would comparison thus you would find out same not less
yet you might find out less since does not cost you
people's reactions scenarios their social preferences their social outcomes obtained themselves others
decision social preferences settings like involve between two social social about others
propose decision hence their social preferences depend their experience setting
thus people's social preferences depend whether not they role outcomes
people tend more their preferences extent they situation
role been recent studies participants were first task were then asked consider another same task
participants one condition were asked determine while participants another condition were asked how they would various
participants who outcomes were far more than participants who their outcomes
particular they were more likely option another more than they had themselves
social preference level
individuals considered when they experience social outcomes were not about their actions
contrast individuals considered when they produce social outcomes outcomes being related their actions
how might affect social preferences
proposed theory theories social comparison social utility
been suggested individuals generally social tend based differences they between themselves others
people differences others negative signals about their own social tend settings
our settings where individuals their aversion so strong their
individuals who however between changes
individuals do not view comparison important social information since their own action
being involved outcomes others they also more about others effect consistent maximization
thus individuals compared ones less attention more about social
our theoretical analysis suggests people construct their social preferences depending their level setting
analysis people should more preferences when they involved outcome other person than when they not
