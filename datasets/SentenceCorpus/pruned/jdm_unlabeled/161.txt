gains losses particularly decision because their perceived well their impact financial decision
past research focused decision making biases hand effect
participants current study outcomes long sequence
risk preferences were found change function i e losses gains length financial
individuals were found differ effect all factors their responses gains losses sequential risky choice
introduction
many decisions over time results past decisions impact future decisions
financial make decisions involving gains losses financial data common method used past performance
gains losses generally some their more characteristics
behavioral researchers patterns so affect future predictions made
influence because often occur without any special underlying
financial predictions patterns provided case studies financial decisions
one example involved prediction number
after long high below average were after long gains
there was number number percent increase close
long outcomes low frequency therefore more likely end they
but assume any who their at time were so because
there no humans probabilistic when predicting random random binary events
but losses gains not like other binary events because events also financial impact decision
losses will result financial just gains will result increase financial
but most studies impact gains losses risk preferences focused based financial
example examined hand
hand another decision bias result random events
decision who hand heuristic if gains losses likely because control
result decision risk more after gains risk less after losses
tested hand effect at number made after after loss
researchers assumed hand bias would make more after than after loss they found many who produced behaviors
however researchers also same pattern risk preferences could result changes financial state occur during gains losses
they suggested could also place more after because they
however had no way financial their study
studies allow examine how gains losses influence risk preferences financial decision
most previous studies gains losses settings not control
example examined effects losses gains single decision
decision was based gains losses prior decision
length was researchers
participants their choice basis prior researchers choices terms hand
although research important decisions experimental design dynamic nature sequential risky choice
prior gains losses had no direct effect financial participants no effect choices made participants
not provided participants experiment probabilistic
one study did dynamic more complex aspects sequential risky choices was
study participants were provided long sequence binary where was amount
although experimental does not change actual risk gamble i e expected value remains same each choice previous research shown participants larger choices
example number number perceived than number number
gains losses occur during long sequences random events participants were play they had their number number they had number
loss gain length before each choice was made also current each time gamble was
tested effects analysis gamble risk each length
losses were negative value gains were positive value
significant effect was found number percent participants each data number
then participants basis visual graphs number
participants had number three participants had shown hand effect number b
also found two participants who provided risk preferences participants number c
participants increased their risk because they perceived long any type signal positive outcome
several questions
outcome financial state some degree at least some subjects p number
many participants study provided significant relationships between risk preference financial state including all but three participants number
addition classification participants visual data number
however whether linear patterns required were actually significant
addition consistent were not always both types gains losses across full range
many participants number number b showed length increased
could change risk strategy during times
finally outcomes each were random therefore financial state at times when could within between participants
does not provide any information about how many participants complete number trials what financial state each was at end each experimental
not out question may only when their initial only when up their initial
difficulty using random event sequences there no control over when will occur what type will occur how long each will
goal current study improve study type length when occur respect financial state
more statistical analysis data will also provide better risk preference patterns during gains losses
i financial will affect risk preferences but gains losses will still influence risk preferences effects
latter hypothesis based evidence decision highly probabilistic involving random binary events
linear patterns risk preferences negative hand positive still expected
however other participants may show significant relationships between variables risk preference there two possible patterns
prior research found may not related length
recently reported reaction sequence outcomes often at three outcomes after third event
second effects follows different strategies different
example being after will must end if
latter perception may out change risk preference occurs leading pattern risk preferences
i use risk strategies during gains losses much more dynamic than suggested previous research
