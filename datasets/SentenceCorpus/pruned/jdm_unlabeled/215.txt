introduction
general negative experience people
however humans world
other people were many others our was many others use was many unknown others money use was many other people contains molecules human most molecules were at one point other part some through body
yet humans their without much about
they do so same way they not their out
number ways number
direct number
potentially other ways number
adaptation many potential
example most people when do not about fact they been many other unknown people some no did not their
if when person them way out people might take paper open
other hand adaptation who his body but adaptation
finally one reduce potential about little no while itself low level so just like smaller
individuals many potential normal they may experience only few times
problem seems most individuals whose them into contact strong example
seems two different types factors at work responses
first individuals who generally less may more likely choose
second processes adaptation may become
adaptation seems like most likely
study explore number
whether adaptation occurs result particular class number
adaptation occurs whether specific class there was
examine questions case first who number number
