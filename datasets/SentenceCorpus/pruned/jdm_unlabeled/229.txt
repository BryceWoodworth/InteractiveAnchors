introduction
when people make basic judgments about example their responses context stimuli presented given size large when most experiment smaller size but small when most larger
long been known more complex real world situations
thus perceived moral depends upon scenarios presented judgment even when participants explicitly context
studies therefore demonstrated importance what may global experimental context set stimuli judgments useful more complex judgment tasks
yet judgments also local context stimuli presented past few trials number authors provided evidence same more complex decisions too
current article idea sequential effects complex judgment task using tools experimental research
judgments events few trials been
approach regression model current judgment dependent variable current stimulus stimuli responses trials sequence
particular use following regression model where p value stimulus presented current p value stimulus previous value judgment made previous
been applied data large number experiments
experiments presented sequence stimuli differ one physical differ asked form some judgment nature judgment depends task
estimation experiments asked number his subjective each either respect standard scale
matching experiments asked one dimension so another dimension
judgment experiments asked each stimulus into one several
identification experiments each stimulus given unique example stimuli number number asked stimulus presented each
been used study sequential effects all
results depend experimental task but general pattern robust response current towards judgment made previous but stimulus presented
there response but contrast stimulus
sequential effects been given various many assume there some previous stimulus previous judgment point reference when current stimulus
even when participants asked stimuli respect they use most recently events framework judgment
many tasks structural similarity estimation judgment people sequence stimuli
however stimuli very different
used very simple difficult memory indeed our processing stimuli limited about number items contrast our identify many complex objects
stimuli may observed sequential effects form accurate may people towards use recent items reference
when people make judgments about complex items when judgments type they very may sequential effects people use only stable scales judgment
indeed many models sequential effects judgment make assumptions explicitly tasks not extended other situations
current article whether pattern sequential seen tasks situations people make judgments about complex objects
three experiments asked participants various items
task because well important our sequences explicitly their cost
task was also because us use complex stimuli require judgments about property does not simple physical presented judgment
experiment number whether judgments exhibit sequential type seen experiments
