however when social find no evidence lower seems lower fact making more rather than moral
introduction
information if only know quality
paper showed given certain conditions good quality would out information
experimental studies support basic
core features model quality
high quality assumed more but only know quality at time
order any take place must also able make quality true
if no other possible considered usually game theory
effect standard game theory if they so
example used
however points out empirical theoretical prediction then suggests often place sufficient because many actually
indeed many experimental studies found most subjects usually do not take advantage another
studies also identify several decision whether particular found less likely occur more other
will moral cost
here present novel experimental study
far know there been no previous study quality
our first aim also context most subjects will tend
most subjects who will actually not
our second main aim study relationship between
where set no gain made actually more good when high quality
no study where subjects only whether
our experiment both quality
at first may they since at time
however will discuss below there several why might less
higher signals higher quality
hence our second question whether our signaling
why would less
following their might lower let us call mechanism moral signaling
alternative mechanism rational signaling who most would actually less when than when
higher relatively less who does not cost high quality
difficult between two mechanisms within same framework
our approach let make both
research social information lead strong preferences part since more
therefore who relatively certain will not out
rational signaling would not expected between whereas moral signaling would if more between
our third question thus whether signaling dependent whether made social
experiment section was designed answer questions
data well
latter data allow us investigate preferences over social
particular tend lower
