considered also provide way mechanisms some good action
one most behavior strong tendency participants more than rational agent theory often at significant loss
suggests humans limited cognitive make correct difficult if not
using series structures found approaches rational agent predictions when participants against computer
however when participants against other humans even when cognitive correct strategy
results suggest humans significant future value over human but not over computer even though may losses behavior
introduction
various types mechanism items limited
given under general conditions even highly tend losses
fact called was first identified
phenomenon since been reported range other field settings well studies
experiments shown large losses over time but even very participants
items fixed but unknown value known common value
conditions because amount region hence its value same all yet cannot estimated
understand source estimates value each correct average some amount
if participants their estimated value will most estimate
since estimates distributed true value most estimate will generally true value loss will therefore occur
hence average statistical fact their estimate more likely than not greater than true value
necessary estimate true value account probability
good less than estimate order fact most likely occur
practice participants do their but not sufficient
there been several proposed mechanisms
generally propose perform due cognitive
hypothesis people understand they must less than their estimates but they how much less
study examine hypothesis find no support
first present data not limited cognitive
then demonstrate depends instead social nature environment
previous work demonstrated social significant effect
participants single high remains people subject may lead high
phenomenon known likely related according our
previously thought phenomenon because uncertainty common value make cognitive
our experiments social environment
each no
our findings address both points
first despite lack information common value people able stable strategies less than number trials constant when cognitive
second find fact strongly dependent social context
