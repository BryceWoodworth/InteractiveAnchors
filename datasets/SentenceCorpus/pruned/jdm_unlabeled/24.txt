examine two individual probability theory hand their
first use data field individuals demonstrate existence impact biases been previously
decisions field consistent although significant individual population
second identify biases within given individual then examine their correlation
find positive significant correlation across individuals between hand biases common two related errors
source correlation control suggest future research could test
introduction
almost every decision make involves uncertainty some way
yet research decision making under uncertainty our judgments often not consistent probability theory

research suggests developed number judgment heuristics complex events
although many decisions based heuristics consistent probability theory there also situations where heuristics lead statistical actions
paper existence impact two statistical hand
both random sequences
thus both involve sequences events rather than events
belief negative random sequence outcomes like
example outcome before
if then after three his subjective probability another less than number percent
thus due more likely appear next than
contrast hand belief positive random sequence outcomes like
example outcome before
if hand then after three correct subjective probability next higher than number percent
thus more likely than
two biases not simply
about outcomes random process e g while hand outcomes individual like losses
due hand person
our study will identify four possible biases individuals could exhibit
its outcome about outcomes involving negative versus positive random outcomes
hand its about involving positive versus negative
thus both after three due hand after three they will more likely next outcome
biases same source heuristic discussed below
paper use empirical data examine existence correlation between hand
paper uses same data examine impact biases
contrast here will identify biases at individual level examine correlation between two
empirical data while difficult obtain provide important robustness other methods biases
participants making real decisions their own money
further participants represent more sample than at very real learn game they make decisions their
use data does however involve some
particular were directly study thus cannot particular individuals why they how they did about their at time
also population while selected population at large
thus will our validity study
biases field at level individual important itself
also one very few identify multiple biases within individual correlation between them
defined belief negative random sequence
example individuals who after three numbers number due more likely appear than number
were first observed under conditions literature probability matching
experiments subjects were asked two would next
after one outcome subjects were significantly more likely other effect literature negative
also demonstrate existence when subjects choose two will appear next
show behavior not simply participants their experiments were asked how they would best their they type
thought heuristic
here perceived process one direction direction
thus after sequence three numbers more likely occur than because sequence more underlying distribution than sequence
test our data at impact previous outcomes current at
people who should less likely number previously
analysis will examine two outcome hand
outcome will simply belief positive random sequence
example individuals who outcome after three numbers another number more likely appear than number because numbers
here outcomes e g numbers rather than individuals hand below
literature probability matching also provides evidence outcome
all found positive effects probability matching tasks
particularly long sequences probability matching game participants were significantly more likely same outcome had been observed previously
will test outcome our data at impact previous outcomes current at
if outcomes they should more likely outcome previously been observed
thus positive relationship between outcomes current belief outcomes
hand different outcome
rather than particular outcome individuals who hand particular person
example if individual past numbers they choose likely future not just numbers previously
demonstrated individuals hand not correct i e probability indeed
other evidence shows subjects game more after series than they do after series losses both when their own play play others
further evidence hand experiment
participants exhibit more their what will next appear after correct than after
hand
related control where individuals they control outcomes fact random
et al suggest hand also out heuristic just
they second data participants asked generate random numbers
generated produced significantly same outcome than random sequence would
will test hand our data at how behavior changes response losses
particular hand predict after individuals will increase number they place after them
just outcome biases hand bias here
individuals they fixed amount their probability
thus after individuals less likely rather than more likely predicted hand because they their
effect been demonstrated who choice behavior series subjects take more risk after than after their about change their good about out
predict after individuals will number they place after loss increase them
thus negative relationship observed between current behavior previous losses will provide evidence bias
large literature individual differences risk
addition previous work identified individual about sequences
uses individuals into
design behavior individuals but no behavior particular no current past outcomes individuals
field previous work also found individual
examine play number individuals who at least number their over time
number had relationships between previous outcomes changes thus bias some
them increased their after they them after they consistent hand while number their after increased them after consistent
studies will use our data analyze individual differences behavior
only two previous examine field behavior at
first field study both outcome
t particular outcomes either because they not some time because way
p number
second source data number who between number number each
number who their most after number percent involve increased risk hand number percent involve risk
after loss number percent involve risk hand number percent do not
however does not present analysis how individuals differ dimension
while previous investigated hand biases our work makes two important original
first provides field setting possible investigate both biases at
biases been together only
second our empirical data will allow us identify individual differences biases
will able examine correlation between biases within individual
study use data field individuals at
useful game number
first other games like where without
second each his own thus behavior
finally popular game requires relatively little play example perceived game
thus likely less selection bias than although participants population above selection bias
involves two
into number even number number
each space number number
shown number numbers
at money either
they given special at
not each at unique
small its
particular number number
next all who had number some their new
number shows along types made
numerical order
place their
type number number called up
single number
if number up would number number number number
when number number directly was not
type between number number two numbers
if either numbers up number number
also number numbers number number number number numbers number number number numbers number number
like even low high
will not our analysis they not often allow identification at individual level but discussed our paper behavior
all same expected value number number percent
since advantage almost all at same there no one way another at all
paper will compare actual behavior against random search significant
