dynamic models decision making decision field theory propose effect context choice series between attributes alternatives across time
they predict amount time make decision should rather than increase size effects
prediction was tested across four levels time both effects choice
overall results prediction both types effects found larger time
introduction
wide body research demonstrated sensitivity preference preferences some degree depend upon set alternatives considered at time choice
effects effects c common examples sensitivity
particular effects examples preference situations preference between two alternatives changes changes context
although much research focused effects little work been explore effect time effect
