standard preference models research assume people all attributes available options derive decision while there evidence use heuristics
recently algorithm been developed model heuristics preference data
compare predictive approach standard analysis online study task
model derived algorithm was better at predicting compared data but overall lower predictive accuracy data than model estimated analysis
however participants was better predicted strategies
new algorithm will not standard tools preferences but study individual differences choice processes
introduction
how do choose
how many attributes do they consider how do they process them form preference
questions theoretical well practical interest
into processes people while making decisions will lead better decision theories
at same time more decision models predicting actions example choice processes
research decision models based idea utility maximization expressed use models derived analysis preferences
at same time judgment decision making researchers propose alternative decision heuristics provide more human decision making evidence their use
recently field judgment decision making been new algorithm decision processes preference data developed et al
aim together two research comparing predictive performance decision processes new algorithm models estimated full analysis standard research
derive theoretical framework adaptive decision making about when approach should test them empirical study
