although heuristic model some its critical process assumptions tested
makes very strong quantitative assumptions about sequential use three cues choices between number difference between outcomes number difference probabilities number best outcome obtained
aspects were present experiment
no support was found
although main effect primary was significant along other effects
strong effect secondary probabilities was not small differences was actually large differences
overall probabilities influence
overall rate choices predicted was close although high
findings fundamental questions about theoretical heuristics fixed
introduction
almost four theoretical empirical work judgment decision making been notion cognitive heuristics
people all available information making accurate judgments
they usually but solutions
cognitive tools solutions called heuristics
their
having first been rules sources biases more recent literature heuristics often characterized fast functional
simple heuristics make us were shown more models rational inference simulation studies
yet addition mathematical simulation heuristics may perform well when they applied psychological assumption decision actually do use heuristics evolutionary learning
although evidence heuristic validity criterion sufficient study first functional hypothesis testing about actual cognitive process heuristic experimental cognitive
thus test assumption judgments frequency probability actually heuristic essential its feature information
test heuristic shown actually initial
without appropriate experimental prove role heuristic process
correct predictions judgments decisions cannot provide distinct evidence about underlying process
early research program though experimental cognitive had been
any experiment had heuristic process heuristic
more recently though situation been
number fast heuristics been allow experimental tests underlying cognitive processes
tests heuristic been assumption cues validity
research recognition heuristic tested whether comparative judgments determined rather than evaluation comparison objects
seems empirical tests more critical validity heuristics
