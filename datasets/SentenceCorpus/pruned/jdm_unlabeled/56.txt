games involving been useful study decision making both
two experiments involving game over made choices between themselves other either themselves but but least but
whether participants were other was another computer did not
using terms game was associated increased frequency behavior
were more optimal than interaction was found first experiment
prior research participants whose were most
overall was strategy although clear context
introduction
being given choice between number number
choice take number every time
now choice following if you number then other will number but if you take number other will instead number
while choosing number number option still optimal choice optimal mean choice maximum amount might know unknown person more than you
when choice was our not all them take optimal
one our would number number option every time make i more than other
person was well having relative advantage over
another would take between options number then number while number then number so both end up same amount number every other
person had while strategy would not either would reduce any between them
third his decisions may differ depending how situation was
paper investigate patterns choices made people simple situation described above if what extent certain affect decisions
popular games examine how participants
example two studied games game game
one distribution example if number number number other
if other number number
if no possible
second
also participants choose between two possible fixed between themselves another
report two studies themselves another where involve points either without value
participants other person other computer
according social model social rules interaction apply interaction participants game might computer same way human
was if would seen our experiments though due fact participants game do not directly rather their choices upon other much same way decisions upon
no way does upon either game
contrast participants experiments always performed some interaction each other whether participants were computer was program was through another person was
predicted lack part computer our experiments would influence our participants choose i e how much how little other gains process more often when computer
participants points value others they do not
question between whether results obtained without
finally although all our participants see their own game participants one our experiments see other well factor might increase task therefore increase choice smaller outcome
previously found there no significant difference between two conditions but their results involved game both participants had decision-making power
although people generally exhibit stable preference patterns variables do affect behavior choice situations
present study whether distribution game strategies affected context game
question extent strategies relatively stable they might if fundamental characteristics
how choice affected other central aspects game participants whether other being another person computer whether aspects game made more
addition game predictions two leading types social preference theories against each other
theories aversion state situations people tend difference between their own payoffs
theories would predict game choose so reduce difference between between payoff choices each pair trials
other hand theory would predict would choose optimal option so social
issue whether not financial affect decisions games been discussed
use real financial financial often between research generally participants basis defined performance usually fixed amount
several experiments their find performance differences function real
found no effect financial performance task
report performance certain types game experiments financial while performance other types games not
game similarity game one decision respect how
their game experiments used real money reported if our game participants similar goal appear then them less often when points not real money
addition call learning more about specific conditions under payoffs improve do not task performance
theoretical perspective important further conditions under financial affect performance
also important if certain studies games produce same results real then human money may
game task used present experiments popular game both games choices participants present them options
game popular any given choice must choose between more still more other less still less other
choices particularly relatively
game choose between outcome optimal both participants one relative but advantage
choice
however trials so possible participants over trials
thus above participants according aversion theories may expected choices payoffs both participants
distribution choices should choices optimal
possible effects other variables whether other person computer should us determine extent distributions choices stable variables
would participants task always larger payoff themselves other
if not how would frequency choices choosing smaller payoff affected each three variables nature other other
would participants who do not choose choose outcome lower payoffs larger
would they payoffs two
