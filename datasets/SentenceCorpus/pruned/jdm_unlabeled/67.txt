research forecasting limited expressed event must so whether not event expressed quantitative probabilities
when expressed then quantitative measures rules etc
used measure accuracy turn used measure comparative accuracy different forecasting methods
most real world not expressed
lack both description event use
thus difficult accuracy most real world accuracy methods used generate real world
paper approach accuracy real world using same quantitative used measure accuracy
demonstrate probability method applied measure accuracy complex domains
introduction
forecasting accuracy methods tools improve accuracy research practical importance
when measure accuracy researchers generally require events described degree expressed quantitative probabilities
contrast forecasting research most describe events use
particularly true about complex events domain interest us
consider example number rather difficult what
number percent number percent number percent
if event occurs would if should accurate
consider also following number addition fact different individuals widely their likely itself define
if there does mean other was found where could
cases difficult clear whether not event
authors forecasting expressed us
they limit their ability what they
example important individuals involved will option less than their expressed preference
addition many quantitative because they later
though there may there still need evaluate accuracy
research judgment would suggest objective feedback accuracy their determine when their were
particular given memory bias would will having low probability when event occur high probability when event did occur
furthermore without accuracy real world difficult compare accuracy different forecasting methods research results research settings widely
between research practice well years research
every research effort described involved defined forecasting questions provide quantitative
actually were not examined
paper describe method accuracy
our objective sufficient evaluation application common accuracy actually
our approach two basic techniques probabilities judgments
first use probabilities quantitative probabilities
simply multiple quantitative probabilities based their understanding rather than their
second multiple who do not see original probabilities research estimate whether not event
addition needed use data estimated
below present our current probability method
