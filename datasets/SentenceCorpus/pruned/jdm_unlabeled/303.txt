effect occurs when better decisions made when people experience before decision than when they make decisions when they time alternatives
effect been people when thought better complex decisions than thought
experiments number number number b study alternative find evidence effect
experiment number alternative thought alternative
all experiments participants did not make better decisions after thought decisions were better than when made after information
people not about complex decisions
introduction
when making complex decision should one take time consider information about each alternative should one review information about best alternative become known
model decision making strategy suggests several making complex decisions number important attributes number each number alternatives all attributes number each weight number each alternative number alternative
thought theory thought following complex decisions because its but thought able similar
therefore complex decisions best all necessary information then about alternatives let at decision
evidence series studies
studies participants given positive negative attributes few alternatives
all alternatives same number attributes but one alternative most positive attributes one positive attributes
best alternatives
after information presented some participants consider information had been presented before alternative best
other participants e g same before making decisions some experiments another group makes decisions after attributes
three groups thought thought groups
people generally more likely best alternative after thought than when decisions judgments made after thought
finding effect
effect been demonstrated complex e g number attributes per alternative but not simple e g number attributes per alternatives decisions
effect occurs only when participants they will making decision judgment after some not when they given information no goal
furthermore effect when participants themselves
also suggested many decisions made found evidence people more decisions made after thought
because importance findings e g people should complex decisions others effect but found little evidence
several studies methods similar et al find advantage thought
some participants long they needed found judgments made after thought judgments at least good better than judgments made after thought
asked participants form four after phase found those condition did not form better judgments best than
furthermore being findings social cognitive clear evidence effect because problems method
one method best alternative
alternative most positive negative attributes best choice
problem consider following example one between two each three known attributes
but while b no but good
two positive one negative b one positive two negative attributes
according one should choose
however person who more than weights should b over
because attributes when positive negative attributes between alternatives difficult know alternative one
et al asked participants attributes were important their decisions so could determined individual basis
problems et al tested effect using alternative
one alternative another if better at least one at least good every other
example if what good about also present b but b also at least one positive not then b
no how person attributes better alternative
et al found after participants could not alternative more often than
however all participants thought so performance could not compared decisions those after thought
despite effect further tests
recent reported mean effect g number thought when compared thought g number thought when compared both thought judgments decisions
new findings advantage thought over thought
example found better at predicting outcome after thought than they when making predictions after
furthermore findings theories applied design
tested results
current set experiments participants were given four alternatives one others experiment number
experiment number compared simple complex decisions made participants after thought
experiments number number b number participants four alternatives after attributes each
difference between judgments best alternatives participants who thought was compared those participants who thought experiments number number b those who made judgments experiments number number b number
predicts participants who thought will best more often than more often than those who thought experiment number
furthermore participants who thought will rate best significantly higher than difference will greater than difference those who thought experiments number number b make judgments experiments number number b number
order alternatives was also examined experiment number alternatives were not experiments number number b number
et al suggest if about alternatives during attributes there should effect information presented later should greater impact decisions than information presented
