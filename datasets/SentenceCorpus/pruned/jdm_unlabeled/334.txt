introduction
proposed recognition heuristic mechanism describe judgments
heuristic inference made basis presence information memory if one two objects other not then object higher value
recognition heuristic decision rule its not only does through simple rule but also process model
development recognition heuristic over research within behavioral decision-making
while recognition heuristic been well many researchers others been rather critical its accuracy underlying psychological processes
recognition heuristic focus inference much like other heuristics place within judgment decision making
while construct judgment decision making research its useful theoretical construct
question however whether recognition heuristic will similar
article present four related researchers recognition heuristic well call fundamental research strategy
argue should our call strategy taken up if theoretical research recognition heuristic
before into few
first our four our call research strategy not but rather future research
second while our call strategy respect recognition heuristic they may apply related models inference including heuristic
likely will require recognition heuristic whether heuristic will then still recognition heuristic our points because observed proposed mechanism not what they called p number
finally some our consider full memory processes judgment decision making
literature memory theory provides theories judgment decision making
while recent work decision theory adaptive role recognition may play accurate judgment errors biases memory including effects source errors many others
memory processes judgment decision making then understanding full range effects associated common memory seems relevant understanding judgment decision making
similar there multiple strategies may judgment decision assumed framework recognition heuristic been need cognitive both multiple strategies model how people them
example not sufficient some choices made recognition memory one must model possible how decision recognition some other process
