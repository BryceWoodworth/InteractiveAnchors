previous research demonstrated bayesian performance if uncertainty information presented natural rather than probabilities
study number effect but also found natural frequency participants who high
finding suggests even natural requires certain threshold effects natural frequency may not general previously
introduction
bayesian performance if uncertainty information presented natural
argue evolutionary point view suggests frequency information humans long before probability theory
although there some among researchers about why natural frequency bayesian result they do improve performance well
current paper examine whether natural frequency bayesian among some people more than others
one result suggests does study
they presented bayesian
participants were base rate rate rate test
they were asked estimate probability given test result actually
accurate responses were more when was presented terms natural rather than probabilities
effect was limited
other three groups performance was both
thus effect natural frequency does not appear universal
natural only some types
one factor may help explain result
defined ability process basic probability numerical been studied number decision tasks because many judgments decisions rely mathematical
example found more people more more risk communication when risk than when does not whereas less people more if given risk
et al found compared their highly individuals more likely use appropriate numerical thus making themselves less effects tasks involving numbers
interest explore whether high more than low uncertainty information presented natural rather than probabilities
present study two bayesian problems
each one problem was presented probability other natural frequency
