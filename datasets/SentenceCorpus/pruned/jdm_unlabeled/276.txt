according level theory including would future sets but may increase future sets
four studies participants choice situation three alternatives
some participants alternatives was was but
participants each condition making decision future whereas others making decision future
participants then set alternatives well each alternative
examined choices between
study examined about
consistent our hypothesis increased evaluation set evaluation set
introduction
through different
all but one them out being especially new all
most you not
how would existence very but alternative affect evaluation set
would you other
some decision may find situation
compared other would would
other people however could fact principle its increase their
other cases including set alternatives may involve especially they out including they not
including
good strategy

would reduce increase set
related question research effect found when between two alternatives alternative than both initial alternatives one them increases choice alternative
example decision may between number number
third alternative number may decision number
both
however more than other alternatives
investigate impact but alternative evaluation set alternatives
suggest temporal distance making choice one factor may determine influence but alternatives evaluation set
specifically based level theory propose when alternatives considered future future sets but do not even increase future sets leading interaction between temporal distance
what follows how prediction test four studies
level theory psychological distance decision alternatives way they alternatives
people tend more alternatives higher level using more
essential events therefore more central essential features
contrast may include more less essential features events
thus whereas future events future events secondary features events
high level features those when more change situation
example typically perceived more change place therefore higher level feature than its
there two ways might predict distance would increase impact impact sets alternatives
first i e value end state alternative should more weight more future decision
contrast i e difficulty alternative should less weight more future decision
because highly but not they would more more future sets
second temporal distance may affect likelihood versus contrast
recently showed psychological distance contrast target
example one their experiments participants compared their either high standard low standard then their expected performance would take place either next later
compared control condition time was not time perspective i e produced high after comparison high standard low after comparison low standard whereas time perspective contrast i e produced low after comparison high standard high after comparison low standard
temporal would make participants more likely contrast set set more than without
temporal distance other hand would reduce contrast produce set
result set alternatives will not may even better presence than without
report four studies examine prediction future sets but do not even increase future sets
addition predicted interaction between time there might also main effects both factors
specifically might produce either overall effect overall contrast effect
temporal distance too might increase set alternatives due temporal
