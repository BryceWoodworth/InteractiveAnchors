three experiments demonstrate how processing evaluation context negative information presented
addition strategy used process different reactions stimuli leading preference
participants were presented stimuli described either presence positive features explicitly positive alternative presence negative features alternative
alternatives were presented either evaluation
experiment number showed stimuli were less than positive ones but not
experiment number revealed stimuli less clear less positive when they were explicitly positive stimuli rather than
options were also found less than positive ones but not
finally experiment number showed people process using two different models depending evaluation
through memory task found people process attributes negative features whereas they directly process attributes positive features
introduction
positive stimulus described either direct difference between two small
instance if person you not high you may either low
therefore above since explicitly what not present but does not how those
possible evaluation context described may affect way they
other words people may evaluate same less if they not high b than if they simply not high
present paper will show specific context effect people's about their reactions turn their preferences
reactions information e g not high evaluation context presented
particular aim show effect evaluation context reactions different ways depending whether explicitly positive comparison form present not
preference may important several domains like instance selection
studies few shown strong between people's reactions their behaviors
therefore if context may influence then may also affect their actual choices
our previous work processing
there been long how actually whether they increase information actual state not high state high
two models different way
first model theories
model called model
states individuals process processing core e g high then complete
et al model two important
first people process core therefore between them at later point time
second associations should state high instead being consistent actual state not high
indeed under model people only after associations been
they end up understanding its but at same time they series associations
model suggested second way process into core
case not high should low
main using model core concept allows people associations actual state
therefore model should make more
just proposed mechanism into core
they suggested should activation state
more recently et al suggested alternative mechanism may account process
proposed mechanism state system
way representation state not representation described world
instead people should able two so they take into account information
other words et al suggested simulation state should fact but not representation described world
et al suggested individuals might use either model model depending
particular found existence original critical how will
present study aim show use either one other model may context presented
series three studies asked participants explicitly positive stimuli characterized having positive features stimuli characterized not having negative features
participants were presented either one both options using versus evaluation
previous studies demonstrated ways preferences
understand stimuli used present study consider example presented
both not high similar value i e both cases does not positive people's health but different ways
three studies find people presented either one other type description do not evaluate them good their
positive lead similar judgments
however find description perceived less way than positive description when they presented together
difference depend how versus evaluation
