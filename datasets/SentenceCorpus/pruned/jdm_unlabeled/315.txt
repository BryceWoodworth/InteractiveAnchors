here use them model patterns information search binary comparison judgment task
simulation involves number subjects making number choice about relative two objects two more
two show how models developed account explain both search rules seen across individuals
discuss how results provide into current literature heuristic decision making argue they demonstrate power bayesian methods modeling human decision-making
introduction
cognitive individual differences behavior both
all subjects our experiments who do what they do
different patterns behavior simply noise subject was cell during experiment but often they due responses our theories models cannot explain
field judgment decision making no individual differences
even theory important theory typically predicts only number percent number percent decisions choice tasks many models do much
how should field individual differences they present our models theories
one approach use bayesian methods existing models apply them ways experimental data
approach not only provide tools individual differences but also theory account why individual differences might
especially important approach because developed models without constraints theoretical assumptions used develop models
taking existing models them within bayesian framework potential current modeling because provides model structure settings
demonstrate application bayesian methods modeling heuristic decision-making use standard experimental requires subjects make judgments about relative two objects size distance so
perform judgments often assumed subjects search their memory sources information cues help objects
example inference about relative size two might cues two so
judgments then determined rules use presence cues provide estimates criterion i e number
tasks although simple several important features need theories models describe how subjects perform them
paper present two simple case studies first information search second rules
