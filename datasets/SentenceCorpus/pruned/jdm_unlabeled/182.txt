according without attention hypothesis people difficult choice will make better decision after than after long effect thought advantage
hypothesis many studies but
here report series experiments identify conditions under
our point was recent identified conditions under was previous studies
using design task each conditions
based previous methods findings then examined some additional factors could important including choice complexity
was no results revealed only significant thought advantage when choice complexity was increased relative first experiment
analyses data across experiments found subjects showed significant thought advantage while subjects showed towards
taken together our results suggest may depend more characteristics sample than characteristics task they suggest could source outcomes previous studies using design
introduction
life people variety decisions involve choices between options many relevant attributes
instance program one consider best possible distance family finding place
rational approach complex decision problem would involve comparing different options extent they
perform decision analysis one would use computer paper out decision problem required
but what if you do not option using instead rely memory information processing making complex decisions
while suggests one should before making difficult choice without attention hypothesis proposed
specifically hypothesis complex decisions best made without following during about choice at hand means task
support hypothesis et al reported results experiment three
information phase subjects information about four were each described terms number characteristics could positive efficient negative does not
one had positive characteristics whereas two had one had only three
characteristics were presented one after other subjects were form each
following information phase one group subjects was they had four about options before they would asked make choice
thought condition
other group was they would first do another four before they would asked make choice
thought condition
results comparison showed subjects thought condition performed better than those condition latter at out best
other words subjects who were given about made choices than those who did not about due task
explain their finding proposed hypothesis
hypothesis processing presented information will at level during task preference will decision when choice made
explain why form better choices than further proposed thought much greater processing information than thought
hence thought would better complex decisions would result thought advantage case decisions involving many options many characteristics
people should rely processing make better choices hypothesis attention other
were considered potentially researchers were alternative
thought researchers investigate conditions
work not very robust phenomenon many studies using similar methods those used
at same time however other researchers produced number
short available literature features number studies together report total number experiments quality judgments decisions was compared between condition see number
experiments number some form while number showed no significant difference performance four showed significantly better performance thought condition thought advantage
given most experiments number used methods similar those used question why results experiments could so
address datasets they examined number between studies
results showed across studies significant effect size number
more results also showed there indeed few significant influence
not only nature choices had made but also manner information were different studies
specifically analysis et al showed effect were larger studies more complex decisions predicted hypothesis
analysis also showed when subjects different goal than options later judgment choice most studies when subjects focus specific aspects information instead general each options most studies
addition was found when information about choice alternatives was presented per alternative instead across alternatives when information was presented at relatively high when information was information
phase analysis showed was when phase was relatively short when task used subjects thought condition involved instead memory task
