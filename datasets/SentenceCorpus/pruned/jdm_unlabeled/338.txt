advantage models do not use parameters one show what degree they predict behavior what situations
three recognition heuristic been examined many points view
here four use optimization models understand heuristics generalization recognition input binary judgment new conditions effects importance conditions cognitive heuristics
introduction
objects his s s described stimulus power learning no more complex than those high
simple models much
yet no model simple complex explain all behavior
simple models one their their conditions turn
does not generally situations object there no g does not change over distance
learning do not every situation concept biological fact certain stimulus stimulus associations learned but not others
organisms work multiple tools not one general principle
concept adaptive individual species characterized set heuristics world
heuristics learned core simple order robust fast efficient
recognition heuristic one tools adaptive humans other species recognition memory
three special testing model proposed
made first before here would like some theoretical
