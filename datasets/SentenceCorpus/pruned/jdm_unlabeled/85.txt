recently found events taken sequence trials than common events effect they
current paper idea situation where participants likelihood
participants were about produced random process human performance either predicted next outcome outcome
scenarios participants effect was same predictions
scenarios no overall bias was found either judgments
results support past same heuristics prediction future they also support idea nature process key whether people into
suggested term used describe situations where taken outcome was type phenomenon belief small numbers
introduction
recent article people's judgments about past history random process might same biases their predictions future outcomes
belief one outcome probability other outcome above base rate
most common people heuristic they small numbers small samples should underlying probabilities one outcome out outcome
suggested might also when people past history random process
rather than having participants predict future outcomes they asked people estimate number trials had particular event
example participants were asked into find times either three two
participants were then asked how many times had before they
estimates participants condition were much larger than those participants condition
result across wide variety domains found estimated number previous trials was greater when outcome was effect they
effect important because suggests heuristics biases our predictions future also our past
however focus work not
rather than judgments about outcomes previous trials manner prediction future outcomes authors estimates number trials
note most would only past


while would natural our knowledge been tested p number
current experiment work test
participants were about one outcome asked either predict next outcome outcome before
additional process was some participants was physical process likely random others was action
was although some judgment domains produce bias belief one outcome increases probability outcome
