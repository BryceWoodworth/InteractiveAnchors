comparison based what call test whether judgments linear function value p probability condition if would treatment
comparison allows validity judgments under assumption decision model validity decision model under assumption judgments
under assumption results judgments large accurate
under latter assumption results support idea constant treatment effect idea treatment constant over various levels disease
our results also support idea judgments far judgments
introduction
judgments how appropriate perform procedure information how perform procedure play major role systems
systems given scenarios disease e g along number e g size number nodes affected asked using certain procedure e g treatment each cases
judgments later used whether not treatment should their patients
view importance methods general particular paper judgments within framework decision model validity judgments their understanding models treatment
our empirical work based judgment had been used whether use treatment
there three relationship between decision model judgments could
first if model assumed describe judgments could used rules underlying judgments
policy view judgment modeling used weights judgment but also determine presence i e other rules underlying judgment
second if our decision model model treatment consistency between model actual judgments could validity those judgments
third if set judgments accurate between model judgments could model basic based
thus whereas second third either model judgment first perspective
term common difference between expected utility taking action expected utility not taking action
thus when treatment number number not appropriate at all number very appropriate scale expected utility treatment higher than expected utility not whereas when number expected utility treatment much higher than expected utility not
important note appropriate judgments support utility treatment
they should direct i e linear utility should
use example consider who asked
appropriate judgment case should related test could test their validity
consider now judgment treatment condition probability p e g number p
assume treatment associated probability p p less than p probability number p
number decision tree
our model assume probability events under treatment one
utility
also assume utility under treatment where event associated treatment
expected utility treatment expected utility not given number number
thus difference between expected utility treatment expected utility not given number if judgment linear representation assumption further discussed below then could expressed number where level positive constant
p p obtain number treatment defined p p p p number
assumption p p constant treatment constant over various levels disease effect treatment constant over various levels disease
example if treatment probability whose initial probability number number number percent number number will also reduce probability b initial probability number number number percent number number
constant treatment effect although not true may describe effect treatment many situations
assumption made many studies
moreover studies where relative risk reduction estimated regression
whereas our decision model judgments function p they usually obtained response scenarios include information about levels various
therefore policy studies usually model judgments function level rather than p any other relevant probabilities
approach two
first does not allow policy model based decision model based probabilities
second scales levels may not linear thus into results
particular not clear whether relationships between judgment represent rule scale
our study models judgment terms both scale terms scale levels expressed using p
example if measured number low number high scale probability within years then levels could expressed terms probability associated each level rather than scale values
process could scale
whereas number number scale not scale changes scale not respect their impact e g change number number may differ change number number scale changes scale could terms their impact
validity judgments taken either approach comparing methods whether decision process biases
few studies also examined validity judgments comparing them models
contrast approaches our basic test validity judgments based approach comparing function form environment model predicts criterion function form judgment model predicts judgments cues
particular our test test involves whether model judgments linear function value p probability derived studies
test test validity judgments since extent our decision model correct model judgments should test
thus linear relation though does not prove validity judgments whereas relation provides some evidence against their validity
note however relationship does not suggest judgments not
particular may result our model being e g assumption constant treatment effect rather than judgments being e g judgments rely probability utility correct integration two
thus our test could test validity our model judgment validity judgments themselves
both need occur
basic question decision making whether judgments result more judgments
despite fundamental importance question not much relevant empirical evidence available because problems associated will allow evaluation utility
context current study criterion evaluation utility not judgments linear
thus our empirical test utility judgments whether not judgments test better than individual judgments
our so far focused judgments under assumption our decision model model treatment
however perspective model under assumption judgments
particular if judgments assumed assumption constant treatment effect
study examine validity judgments specific setting number b
common cancer world
during number years agents been series both trials

other words at increased frequency
so judgments must perceived between
