people been shown delay decision making would not their decision if known at delay uncertainty true preference
test account relative alternative delay low confidence preference information delay latter reduce influence sources delay any influence uncertainty
results were uncertainty account under low delay did not depend information under high delay rate was actually much lower when information was
explain latter propose people use strategy choice under uncertainty does not require preference each value information
findings related others choice difficulty been found major source delay
introduction
decisions how much information should decision before choice alternative
common much relevant information exists world yet some will not affect choice
term information whether not some information could actually choice preference strategy only information
contrast strategy however decision been shown delay choice obtain information
been across wide range decision situations including choice selection games
example was found when was either very popular less popular one but was not yet known would individuals choice
information was was fact when less was known no was available individuals
interest here why choice delay occurs context information research present important question
particular individuals actually information per
they other
proposed individuals specifically obtain information phenomenon because information uncertainty decision true preference
rather than their preference decision choice any additional information will situation uncertainty account
contrast developed alternative account here confidence account
account occurs gain not information uncertainty but rather gain confidence alternative through occur even when all information known
consistent their account they found choice delay even when decision less option had become available some cases rates certain condition were found high those one
furthermore they found less decision were their initial preference well delay more likely they were choice
there limited evidence influence information uncertainty source choice delay above low confidence
because only used control condition could between extent uncertainty delay behavior across range remains
sources delay further evaluate evidence uncertainty account relative low confidence account present research delay behavior situations there some not choice relative those little not delay
introduction delay important one experience e g information risk all available full account delay behavior should able data context
more central present work context delay people make more at choice than they might do
result not only does introduction potential information effect high context but also potential two sources delay
particular large might produce greater delay than uncertainty because delay under because preference known than delay uncertainty
two experiments delay behavior context information both presence significant delay information
experiment number involved risk participants were either there was high risk loss alternative over time risk was
experiment number instead involved cost participants were either high cost
both experiments information condition value information would not known next certain information condition was known least value
delay certain condition consistent confidence source delay although any additional delay condition uncertainty expected evidence both sources each level
evidence two sources delay further predicted would between strategies delay certain condition where low confidence only source delay might choice difficulty when at least preference been identified than when been selected
