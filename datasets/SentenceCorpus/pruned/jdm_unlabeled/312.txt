introduction
when often important
well behavioral domains
ability small rewards order larger future rewards effective both humans
report examine impact information about outcomes human decision-making behavior situations short rewards
outcomes rewards could been obtained had one made choices
our task aspects tasks people choices outcomes determined past choices well current choices
study found ability e g one order more outcomes e g two after delay predictive number key
several studies suggest most effective strategy attention stimuli during
specifically who direct their attention smaller reward better able gains them gains
systems framework one popular theory performance delay studies
according theory level systems
system fast stimuli
contrast system
between two systems either support delay
e g whether reward factors e g whether attention focused reward rewards system
rewards become more one more likely control system lead delay
one previous studies they involve options do not occur situations
participants explicitly when larger rewards will
real world people given information about actions
example consider between short
at each choice point new training thus increasing future output instead order thus future new
choices influence state environment future
here choices not known future time points
optimal choice must some extent learned through decision space our example increasing resulting training
present work optimal choice behavior dynamic task choices more representation many short life
whereas choices decisions many decisions often past outcomes current situation determined past choices
experimental proposed ability rewards dynamic choice environments
consider task reward structure number
current state decision environment whereas reward either choice
every state one option option always higher reward than other option option
state environment defined number choices made over trials
making larger choices over time current state environment thus increasing rewards both choices
choices larger rewards affect future rewards above example whereas options less lead larger future rewards new training
dynamic choice environment i e global rewards requires larger i e local rewards option making choices
literature examined factors ability learn choice strategy similar environments
report consider dynamic decision making tasks people learn about rewards resulting both chosen i e options
example may able both actual result further cost would
although neural signal rewards distinct directly rewards been identified both humans how reward signals behavior
behavioral research human decision making some into how knowledge rewards affect choice behavior
settings where rewards change over time rewards support optimal choice when rewards optimal choice when rewards
further sensitivity rewards over time settings
present work research dynamic decision-making environments
tasks been used examine effects rewards information rewards actions dynamic tasks upon past choice behavior
rewards present determined recent history choices
consider particular form sequential short rewards
task strategy rewards not at
thus computational described greater below past decisions better rewards present
when short rewards rewards local option e g bias choice option e g training
our predictions dynamic decision tasks consistent findings studies find attention reward increases likelihood gain but larger reward
investigate information presented about rewards after each choice task above see number
example after choice might shown number points were actually well number points could been had made choice
our hypothesis information will larger payoff decision space leading behavior long
our results find more information i e about payoffs makes less likely will
result standard learning mechanism single systems
according systems view greater rewards associated option should increase control over choice leading consistent selection option
mechanism result without two systems different computational properties
models learn their interactions environment gains making use reward signal provides information about actions
framework been used model human decision-making behavior well firing patterns neurons
our model i e reward signal action not taken decision space because tasks where short rewards necessary optimal choice strategy
components account provides simple account choice behavior related tasks
rule out effect rewards does not additional information but rather local option include additional condition rewards provided
would demonstrate reward information biases choice does not participants information optimal choice behavior
demonstrate control condition rewards
condition when option chosen rewards option appear greater than rewards order belief option
when option chosen rewards option appear smaller than reward order belief option
example who at they had was actually was
short actual feedback chosen option but information about option option
if additional information about rewards does not participants should find participants provided information about rewards should make more optimal choices than participants not provided rewards
other words predict more less when local information gains but more more when local information gains
