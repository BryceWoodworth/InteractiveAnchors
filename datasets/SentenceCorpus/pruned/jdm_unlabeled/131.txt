like any decision regret when they compare outcome what outcome would been had they
argue show comparison process most likely take place when decision
across experiments found decision were only outcomes when short expected result
however when their prior effect regret
addition experiment number found individual differences need further effects their always take into account
experiment found when make also may lead regret
together experiments into comparative processes leading decision regret
introduction
regret negative most us
highly relevant context decision making been widely studied behavior researchers
regret associated event strong tendency second
makes regret decisions made been shown predictor behavior
findings theories regret its impact decision making proposed theory regret regulation
their number p number they state regret when people their present situation would been better had they past
who example if only i had i would much more regret
theory regret regulation was developed understand how regret strategies used
understand impact regret important further develop into processes may
discuss here how prior about outcomes decisions play role
let us fact regret
regret one simulation what what could instead then compare two
hence outcome reference point against regret
how regret been early regret theories also been well
comparing decision outcomes regret may itself comparative may actually decisions
found experience regret also affected other comparison
research revealed not only into regret but also obtained outcome prior
through online they number
several questions their chosen
results showed outcomes considered but indeed regret over their
but relevant here chosen were also significantly related regret over their financial decisions
larger difference between more regret
found similar effects experimental field study number
obtained outcomes prior been literature emotional response but not yet regret
because regret many ways related though distinct both role decision making
research also their number p number regret distinct related other specific general negative affect basis its behavioral
may well case regret sense experience
whether both alternatives will examined experiment number
two studies best our knowledge first fact may impact regret but note research remains respect underlying psychological processes
also data studies were strong
present study thus take between findings et al prior work regret
do investigate experimentally impact expected outcomes regret some psychological processes involved
