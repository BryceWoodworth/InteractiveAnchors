often problems features
what they likely do situations
presented number family their information
feature while other features either
due risk should considered
participants number percent only number them
they less information less time than those who
no feedback was provided participants
number revealed differences way same information was function
group important cues making them their representation group them evidence problem
most they were very certain about their
observed described judgment evaluation information so judgments even information
role error examined
introduction
primary difficult
usually not life
however conditions may if not
there evidence may primary
against primary more than other conditions against family
studies found well patients their significant factors
studied using who attributes his
described later features i e some features others
describe how people situations what they do order
i e information about two alternatives people will form preference one alternative will information so alternative
they may even information one alternative order preference other alternative though generally information increases
if preferences judgments change result new information now new preference judgment
seems information psychological individuals form judgments
studies decision making
participants case information i e where each position was probabilistic evidence asked them their confidence
they participants either them dna evidence either number number dna evidence being
before case participants had been asked rate each evidence presented them various social situations
after they their case participants were asked rate each evidence time presented them context case
new were consistent significantly ones made
seems evidence was perceived was part model case
its perceived thus increased
authors argue dna should no relationship other evidence case identification
now perceived related their evaluation support what authors call
basic experimental procedure been several order test whether different factors affected
were found even when participants were asked simply case
when they were asked rate their various case had function
however were observed between phase after but before being asked towards
findings suggest not simply result decision
processing complex case either make decision later further information order
was complex represent way
information been investigated tasks required no prior experience
people experience specific domain making judgments within their domain studied
one study participants information their choice either having place later simply processing task information
they information greater extent than participants without experience
investigate how difficult problems contain information where cannot
primary itself type
was one scenarios larger study investigated relationship between experience information search accuracy difficult problems family
found across scenarios experience was not related accuracy was predicted only number critical cues i e cues value relevant
