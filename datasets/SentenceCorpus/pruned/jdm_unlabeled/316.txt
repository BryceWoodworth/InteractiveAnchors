introduction
within decision making literature there exist many decision theories both defined
theories decision strategies not defined terms random variables therefore do not explicitly account choice decision
yet many researchers observed not consistent their observed choices across same stimuli set choice type
choice does not over experimental same subject random responses learning experience effects
many researchers suggested different methods stochastic decision strategies choice
stochastic fixed level error responses
hand stochastic follows single strategy some probability choice alternative not
other class models preference model choice random variable noise
another class stochastic those multiple decision strategies choice sampling process over set strategies
there many above well
further choice stochastic use not one
recently different lead different same set decision strategies should not about noise when decision strategies
article present new strategy classification framework set strategies over multiple types stochastic
consider single strategy error well probabilistic strategies using model selection directly compare different models one another optimal pair set observed choice data
thus our framework not only choices but also stochastic
our classification framework simulation study three different decision strategies over four types stochastic
also apply our framework existing empirical data set test preference
article will classification strategies using choice data perspective often comparative model
how one out strategy classification via choice data
at most basic level could strategies simply number times strategy was observed data problem stochastic
however rate approach lead significant biases strategy classification
how lead theoretical data
et al provides related practice strategies
more recent approaches statistical models out strategy classification
developed statistical framework models single strategy some fixed probability making error
under framework strategy classification out comparing factor
basic approach been applied choice decision making under risk
approach any number additional measures decision time confidence data into likelihood function allow theories predictions at choice level see also
approaches similar assumption all same stochastic
problem following different stochastic et al likelihood test evaluate set strategies under various stochastic
set studies they found were best variety stochastic mixture strategies consistent expected utility many
likelihood test however test may lack statistical power when applied small samples
does likelihood test provide measure model complexity
article strategy classification framework multiple stochastic decision strategies including probabilistic multiple strategies
while many possible under our framework will three described number applications article
were chosen their theoretical data set section number well our approach
apply minimum description length principle maximum likelihood out model selection among all pairs
maximum likelihood model selection models based upon its complexity model provides good account data
