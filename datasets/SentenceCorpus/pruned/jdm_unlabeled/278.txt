introduction
at least since end second world policy decision-making been rational perspective model world basis rational choice across
although well decision often make rational choices assumption they utility
example performance s policy little policy decisions should result choices
strategy states explicitly states actions results rather than
recent work values under along common scale
new body research often values affect decision-making
example large scale study presented subjects involving over core future experimentally within each
contrast rational perspective subjects who under values greater those values
because they made against values along
however effect only people who issue value not those who values important but not
existing empirical work values been focused complex often life several over over
yet seems possible much context become values especially when they involve
research reported here investigate whether values would also lead judgments decisions would not rational
specifically focus its program using test values
past few years its having program part past events was
specifically made effort issue strongly people
between events context
its having program at recent cannot any respect
while about program focused position they will not one will domain
