both increase number potential
theoretical practical well future research
introduction
recently much literature importance numbers alternatives choice
considered two
one reported effects when people make unique different numbers alternatives
example studies choice decisions involving
moreover recent suggests effects depends choice decisions made
focus second perspective what when people across different numbers alternatives
present paper
specifically consider issue context investigate effects numbers alternatives amount total well their distribution across specific
both important theoretical practical
example when might consider whether them small large potential
at same time often different important know how number affect total
report two experiments
first explore effects when across different numbers
second investigate what when single different numbers
short find two effects increasing number alternatives total increase at rate distributions affected
specifically tend become less case but more so case
second experiment also investigate use specific
when current practice choice limited one several alternatives lower than when does not apply
