introduction
our many small large decisions exist within variety
many choices involve some risk like whether certain treatment options even whether risk human
most studied examples risk decision making involve risky choices presented within positive negative framework effects
effects derived theory predictions become one most studied examples rational decision making
according theory outcome either loss gain amount risk person
effect differences perceived subjective value value function gains preferences convex losses preferences
most widely tested example presented participants disease problem number were at
participants were then presented set alternatives one other risky
alternatives were either terms people would
their findings revealed despite expected values most participants alternative when problem was risky alternative when
