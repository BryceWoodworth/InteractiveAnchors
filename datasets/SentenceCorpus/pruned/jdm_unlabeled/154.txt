present maximization three scales decision difficulty alternative search
show items maximization much better properties when compared original maximization scale
scale new addition study maximization behavior demonstrate scale correlated positive adaptation whereas decision difficulty alternative search scales correlated behavior
maximization was then compared previous maximization scales while decision difficulty alternative search scales correlated similar previous scale dimension different maximization
introduction
one most variables decision making research tendency versus
based theory suggested there may individual differences degree individual who find best solution versus who good solution
not only could influence outcomes decision but also could reduce psychological
example may option will turn out best one they will much information possible when making even decisions
examine relationship between health measures maximization behavior were developed
first most widely used measure was number maximization scale developed et al
examined factor structure maximization scale found three factors they alternative search decision difficulty high
alternative search items tendency all possible e g when i i often through available options even while one program

decision difficulty four items degree difficulty when making choices among options e g i often find difficult

high three items decision tendency high themselves general e g no what i do i

contrast nature maximization scale maximization tendency
maximization tendency general tendency identification optimal alternative et al developed maximization tendency scale
maximization tendency scale was using three high items maximization scale new items goal outcomes decisions
all scale development theoretical been directly measured only literature
research scales hypothesis relationships support depending whether total were used
et al reported results several studies all relationships maximization psychological
their study number maximization was correlated life correlated regret
four additional studies showed maximization scale total were correlated correlated subjective
et al tend alternative search increase finding best option but search process may more regret choice been made
related studies et al used number measures each three factors
they found high were correlated correlated subjective
decision difficulty showed pattern being correlated subjective correlated
decision difficulty key factor leading negative outcomes findings et al
contrast et al found evidence high was relationship because smaller were found when were compared maximization tendency scale rather than maximization scale
thus previous studies suggested maximization measures several components relationships were method
nature maximization construct degree its elements were related measures psychological maximization scale maximization tendency scale were examined four studies
et al maximization scale measures three factors its authors but only alternative search difficulty factors both correlated each other correlated
high correlated strongly maximization tendency scale high items was strongly correlated positive e g e g
high maximization tendency scale were correlated decision making while alternative search decision difficulty were correlated decision making
theory analysis et al properties items existing scales
addition their experimental study alternative search decision difficulty were correlated maximization behavior while high maximization tendency scale were not
findings maximization behavior
first although high useful construct does not concept maximization
alternative search dimension seems construct
however similarity pattern between decision difficulty scale alternative search scale criterion variables suggests similar if not similar
thus propose items behavioral aspects e g alternative search emotional features e g perceived difficulty should network but items not aspects should e g high
all previous classical test theory analyses theory analyses et al suggest properties
analyses most were below number number minimum usually considered research
although may length scales theory analyses suggest items themselves not very
also some items may validity scale
example maximization scale some maximization behaviors specific situations may not universal all e g difficult
always best ones

items too specific might degree maximization event
new items more general maximization e g more specific than may prove useful
finally all alternative search decision difficulty items maximization scale same direction i e more greater perceived decision difficulty means measured only lower end maximization dimension
direct construct would understanding maximization behavior
based previous research nature maximization behavior present series studies was designed develop evaluate new measures decision difficulty alternative search
addition develop measure examine its relationships other decision making
study number use classical test theory factor analyses theory determine best items each three scales larger
our goal was develop scales number number items each scales form maximization measure maximization construct
after best items each scale report values each scale resulting factor structure estimated parameter values theory analysis
study number was designed investigate relationship between developed measures
new scales through their relationship criterion measures demonstrated et al
study number examined relationships new scales two major maximization scales studied maximization scale maximization tendency scale
