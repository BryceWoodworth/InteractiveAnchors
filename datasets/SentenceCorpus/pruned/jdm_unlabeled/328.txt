what role recognition choice
recognition heuristic situations where recognition correlated decision criterion objects will chosen more often than ones any other relevant information available about object
past research investigated decision heuristic inference
here report two experiments preference using choice task
results revealed although recognition was preferences was used rather than way
specifically additional information learned about objects significantly affected choices
recognition manner combined other attributes choice
introduction
tend like what know
studies effect experience our preferences other objects tend related their
but what mechanism recognition choice
article whether choice mechanism recognition heuristic
been investigated choice domains larger
simple adaptive human judgment decision making proposed research group
researchers shown classical decision strategies e g linear regression bayesian models aim integration relevant knowledge gain optimal prediction decision criterion efficient knowledge case recognition
was proposed most situations where knowledge limited not all choice set
there various other domains recognition knowledge limited where choices depend preferences rather than
one example choice
money
although many often their simply increase
positive image
present study investigate exact role recognition choice
more specifically see whether under certain participants will rely recognition choice strategy any other information they may about
instance when between two only one participants may simple heuristic choose
they may recognition other information known about whether good environmental
present research therefore past studies recognition heuristic into new domain choice
