introduction
some use
short empirical research heuristic
fast heuristic was introduced provide alternative proposed strategies judgment decision making research
according models rational decision requires integration all available information about all alternatives
integration become complex information cues probabilistic
however were able show simulation binary cue choosing best alternative out two very simple when available cues sequential order validity probability cue will lead correct decision given between alternatives direction first cue
stimulus environment they used their population size number features being present not simple search rule rule decision rule decisions same quality computational integration set cue information
information search after having found first cue therefore been called decision making
term was chosen clear contrast models integration all available information usually not how information was
models complexity simple complex multiple linear regression
what they common at least two information need present comparison case several cues same option integration available information
contrast class class under term decision making because search more than one information information integration
most high number correct predictions compared models
mathematical results allow rank rational strategies used probabilistic decision making especially but not only when information
however empirical findings use compared models were
while some studies were generally against use because they found only particular use strategy more recent studies shows more evidence use
one question fact participants showed using single strategy
so far there been no statistical environments all participants experiment according using
but what even more use rule
most effect was reported testing sequential search using only two available cues they found number participants number percent their sample information search some even when more cue hence fact second cue would not able first information
