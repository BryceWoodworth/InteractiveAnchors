study whether probability observed when individuals presented series choices between real outcomes
our estimation parameters probability function proposed similar those obtained previous studies choice negative payoffs negative payoffs
addition common choice behavior
our results provide evidence probability general phenomenon independent source
introduction
expected utility theory standard theoretical model choice under risk used analysis
utility linear probability each possible outcome
while modeling number experiments called into question model choice under risk see review literature
other hand probabilities function where provide good empirical available experimental data
low probabilities high probabilities
recognition empirical support probability key assumption several theories choice under risk including theory rank dependent expected utility theory theory
particularly phenomenon probability common
consider two individual utility function
first payoff number probability p payoff probability second number probability p
assumption expected utility theory individual who first over second one must also choose probability p over probability p
if greater than then greater than
common result probability later out been found domain positive payoffs involving outcomes
empirical support underlying probability common experimental studies all outcomes involve
however many decisions involve losses
examples include decision choose among alternative another person
few studies decisions domain losses they used one two techniques negative payoffs
some studies researchers use payoffs examples include
other studies participants given real at experiment real losses initial examples include et al
however many real life decisions involve negative outcomes not
consider cancer who asked make choice between two involve between probabilities different states health e g versus
another example decision case reduced
choice between over time
however exists when decisions over outcomes how do real outcomes type
some authors used stimuli investigate other decision making
example et al used well having subjects place their study effects preferences
et al required individuals study decisions good negative value
paper use negative payoffs
good measure almost would rather
addition means use reward experiment
larger either than smaller one
fixed current therefore its
furthermore our simple decision task described below given levels applied our experiment differences between levels alternative choices large between alternatives
physical also other individual cannot other individuals
paper consider whether phenomenon probability particular pattern probability observed when people involve whether common been observed involving positive also appear our setting
addition although probability predict complex pattern out probability particular consider see more risk aversion when better i e when there lower overall means would tend
find both probability common features our data
probability parameter estimate very similar those observed decisions over negative payoffs
results suggest similar process probability choice both outcomes when payoffs negative
