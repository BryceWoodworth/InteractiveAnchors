introduction
common sense would suggest always better more rather than less relevant information when making decision
most theories decision making models all relevant variables
perspective was group who proposed theoretical framework simple decision rules often fast heuristics some cases decision less relevant information may actually all relevant information
fact many heuristics use single cue selected among many available prediction task
key among decision rules recognition heuristic
empirical literature suggests decision rules at least subset both take best
questions however when why rule will perform well
examined relative performance rules within binary choice framework where both predictor independent criterion dependent variable were assumed continuous
using combination tools simulations they found rules strong predictive accuracy when number all highly number single predictor used highly typically correlated criterion
related analysis using binary rather than continuous cues
identified similar conditions rules using series simulations
environments highly correlated environments demonstrated simulation rules when model were correlated finding was later et al
similar presented framework analyze simple decision rules within context
paper present results single variable rules previous studies two major ways
first show when single predictor without any loss correlated other where each either correlated optimal greater weight than any cues
result major previous studies identify conditions rules models where all variables highly correlated
second our results do not rely any specific assumptions about cue defined between cues criterion
only correlation single cue
some rules depend upon either knowledge estimation all cue
example take best rule depends identification single best cue
our results validity single variable need not among available
apply new results argue recognition validity i e correlation between criterion recognition criterion variable recognition through variables environment
our results our different approach question when does less information lead better performance
first within framework linear model i e within standard regression framework single predictor
regression framework best set weights cues if one had data knowledge they would predictive accuracy call vector weights
then consider weights would cues various decision heuristics if they were estimates
within framework prove results respect measure statistical called risk defined section number measures how close heuristic weights expected best weights
measure particularly useful because within single sample set weights best weights more new samples
advantage problem within framework linear model results range situations including choosing between more than two options binary continuous recognition evaluate any single variable rule not just
show under certain conditions greater weight single variable relative all others form optimization maximum value risk over all choices decision rules
number cues large strategy rule large weight single cue weights all others
use term describe effect single predictor cue more weight than any other predictor cue according optimal strategy
further show single cue all others same risk single cue all others number cues
previous research shown decision heuristics applied manner standard regression models samples become very large
thus under conditions single variable just accurate predictor full set
while framework could used any single variable heuristic argue sufficient conditions environments one would use where recognition single cue
indeed examine data used prior recognition tasks show well our sufficient conditions
our does not assume cue selection process
other words always single cue interest
theory natural application results theory also does not cue selection process i e if one alternative other not then recognition predictor cue interest
why recognition rational
our results demonstrate when single cue recognition correlated all other cues knowledge then strategy recognition cue
results do not depend upon either recognition knowledge cues
paper convergence two
one hand single variable rules them robust statistical risk within linear model
another perspective our results suggest heuristics could work no other than they approximate optimal statistical model objective function been literature
thus while see approach contrast heuristics being used optimal statistical computational power would use rule much like
paper follows
first recent evaluation decision heuristics within linear model make some assumptions
then describe sufficient conditions phenomenon first case single variable correlated more case set within
then present application theory prove under conditions only recognition will perform at least well only knowledge
then examine matrix empirical study finding support accuracy sufficient conditions
