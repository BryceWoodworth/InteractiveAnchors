individual difference measure difficulty delay decision making
associated low confidence distinct patterns information search behavior
present study whether confidence levels search behaviors associated individual also group decision making
study number participants were make decision group
was found predict confidence individual condition but not group condition group participants being overall more than individuals
similar results were obtained other related measures decision task
no differences information search were found other aspects group process increased confidence
results provide initial evidence does not influence group decision making especially individuals groups may way confidence
introduction
individual difference measure associated difficulty delay decision making
include taking long time not how during decision making decisions ones decisions
given individuals appear many tasks important goal identify likely effective decision making
present research question whether relationship between patterns decision making search observed individuals groups
introduction first review past empirical work relationship between confidence search patterns
then our interest relationships group decision making context relevant group literature
finally present empirical study relationship between patterns decision making individuals versus small groups
