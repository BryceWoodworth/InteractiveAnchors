forecasting decision making people often do represent degree belief some
at least two belief support weight
paper weight evidence subjects using belief function situations where relevant goal
subjects impact sets evidence complexity within situation
study potential weight measure alternative probability measure
responses weight likelihood were weight single elements there were individual differences reactions evidence
specifically most subjects evidence sets support sets although their support
individuals would likely require greater amount evidence than others tendency support
thus study value understanding weight distinct likelihood our understanding judgments weight application belief functions communication
introduction
probabilities useful when complete knowledge e g forecasting decision making
probabilities measures likelihood against criterion
rules quality probability judgments perspective comparing likelihood actual outcomes application criterion
however very probability theory not only criterion potential interest probabilities
recognition analysis knowledge number true belief number use probabilities short knowledge
analysis two along may
theoretical basis between probability based likelihood relative criterion probability based support relative criterion

also basis common between weight evidence major role study decision-making
short evidence criterion
if true
degree evidence evidence measure
weight evidence criterion
weight depends upon evidence how much good evidence there
how well does evidence any
weight does not
probability theory when judgment one hypothesis increases judgments must same amount
one only one set events occur thus should exhibit probabilities feature
contrast weight construct criterion not expected exhibit property
increased support one does not support other
belief functions theory discussed paper measures do not necessary
one source between likelihood weight measures them measures generally
useful here weight two aspects size
though measures they distinct size
probabilities measures likelihood belief functions measures may but they different
provided how weight addition evidence explain various empirical characteristics confidence judgments
there number situations primary interest decision interest addition
example interest settings where goal analysis upon tasks not e g within policy inference
despite history their potential measures been little studied been measures likelihood
research been different
probability theory many applied because relative frequency
application system used use theory more about underlying theoretical mechanisms judgments
here theory based between aspects weight unique features theory e g its natural representation i e case where no information present
terms previous work using theory most prior research system been theoretical example use belief functions uncertainty systems addition instead using probabilities
although sparse there some empirical work
work directly work effects decision making weight decision behavior
addition responses exhibit belief manner consistent theory
perspective demonstrated judgments
subjects number showed clear relevant evidence relevant evidence number p number
results support value weight distinct more construct likelihood
since likelihood judgments more attention than weight judgments often them particular must
specifically important literature need measures present application theory theories likelihood theory subjective probability called support theory
