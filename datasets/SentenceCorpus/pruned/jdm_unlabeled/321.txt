long known problem significant results bias may lead estimates true effects being investigated
even though other research e g biology problem identified strong biases researchers judgment decision making
two current area
both showed evidence biases may true effects they investigated
review additional shows most no analyses bias
however given our results effects literature biases occur often
findings suggest based without reported tests bias should b standard research should problem
introduction
comparison results larger significant results underlying population effect
long known discussed problem significant studies will therefore lead literature provides robustness size effect question
when results even effects may appear
strong direct evidence significant results literature area where several samples all studies specific research question become available
samples studies drug review
several compared results studies data were
recent particularly example et al
data base number trials effect agents were drug states
according number studies reported significant primary results
studies were
contrast number studies main results number
additional number studies but main outcomes studies dependent variables considered most relevant were
combined effect size studies was g number
literature however combined effect size was g number
field nature individual studies their results particular
however one did similar procedure biases
data base all studies were human subjects at s between number number
number percent studies significant results were
studies outcomes however only number percent were
thus there strong evidence biases affect literature several including
even though hypothesis tests may less area than still widely used procedure
results give good assume biases do occur
thus main question article whether there evidence estimates effect literature biases
generally biases validity body knowledge represented literature
however studies may standard comparison problem may only become when study results quantitative review
any review literature including will produce estimate true effect if available information sample relevant research area
at same time provide extent problem
several methods been developed aim whether effect affected bias
human biology several examples biases been identified using methods data
however whole problem been
following will first provide methods detection biases
then will use methods some one area
