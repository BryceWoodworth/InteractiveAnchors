during continuous response provides measure growth preference than current practice just choice itself
recent research cognitive shown cognitive processing revealed dynamic responses
current process response dynamics studies demonstrate continuous between choice options even online preference
here order demonstrate utility present example response dynamics experiment common decision task
introduction
past few seen change level analysis theories models decision making
generally models outcome prediction way computational models focus processes assumed produce responses
focus underlying cognitive processes e g effects within rather than complex functions cognitive
theoretical empirical order evaluate more process theories
example information search during decision tasks developed use information techniques techniques
other methods response time analyses been used several together provide evidence
here would like introduce what consider next important step important evolution our response dynamics decision making
techniques identified above their dynamic nature choice preferences
process one information search not process itself information perception how they task subject characteristics response times how long task but not nature processing occurs during
not measures always many authors applied analyses example characteristics decision process
however generally notion observed choices result dynamic process where evidence various response choice alternatives may over task
specifically lack sufficient explore dynamic evolution preference real time
given evidence assumption theoretical treatment support
recently body research cognitive novel current methods identified above
research response dynamics continuous online processing information revealed response
describe theoretical basis applications approach
basic involves simply position selection option decision task
theoretical assumption alternatives influence response there now behavioral evidence
therefore one measure properties response about underlying processes
goal current work introduce research types analyses makes possible
only other explicitly application responses risky decision making task involving either gains losses ability describe changes direction preference online during task
when gamble gains subjects very directly gamble
when they risky gamble they first towards gamble before direction towards risky gamble
pattern was generally true losses
results support models allow preference one option during task but choice other option e g models sequential sampling behavior would not existing response methods
following study show another application task task
task because its use design allow us utility response dynamics both within types e g following gain loss below across task metric learning
task been used decision making individuals
subjects presented four each provides every losses but they different characteristics see number
typically two b considered high rewards high result loss whereas two other c d good lower rewards but also lower more resulting gain
