introduction
much people their expected utility when making decisions under uncertainty
contrast argue people often not so much their expected utility but instead their expected regret people make choices their expected when action out compared other alternatives
some decision environments lead people over action what known bias
role wide range decisions
example people potentially even when risk comparison primary disease
number us their when optimal do so
many us their despite presence
often make when
impact expected regret bias experimental setting because requires complex set risk aversion
paper study expected regret bias actual play at
two important features make
first setting issue optimal play every situation optimal play way
because there solution game known basic strategy been widely since number s
indeed many learning basic strategy
second more place game before they make decisions
therefore all but few situations cost play optimal strategy independent level risk aversion
fact allows us identify role regret independent risk aversion
data over number number over number number actual play
data our study were obtained study number recognition system designed games
number system based all choices during play data way
allows us essential features game manner natural play game
using novel data source find strong evidence bias present choices make
when make they four times more likely make error than they make error taking i e action
relevant hypothesis bias would errors how often were required take under basic strategy
even if focus strategy space action optimal strategy leading high number under bias high degree confidence
bias large
who basic strategy number number percent time very close theoretical rate reported
only number number percent time significantly lower
total about number number during study
basic strategy total over number number while they only about number number following basic strategy
contrast only number number was over number number basic strategy
over number every while only about number number every
therefore not only more common they more
consider alternative other than bias choices
first basic strategy
explore examine basic strategy find no evidence manner strategies
should also note since rates among basic strategy so low losses so high
second limited cognitive ability our results
indeed may some find difficult optimal choice all situations
control account difficulty certain situations e g versus
idea here if cognitive make bias more then should more among more difficult
find though bias not more among higher order required
third possible derive utility play thus take additional if so might them
test account position at number at
at large find no evidence more among those who high order at
does not rule out hand however does represent another source expected regret
indeed if people were expected because they would if they did not game when they would further support our expected regret decisions
analysis paper work who used game understanding about game
they observed complete history play number subjects many learn their how they make decisions
while they data set provided many our analysis distinct focus bias alternative result
indeed place study other aspects human behavior decision making
studied hand bias individuals who play
also been study though many difficult regret risk aversion cognitive
example derive game show optimal strategy
indeed consistent bias risk aversion cognitive but one observed behavior generally difficult
