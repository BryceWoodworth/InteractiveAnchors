introduction
better you know than you
most people when between options known probabilities others probabilities uncertainty
people often choose what decision call aversion
decision choice between two one number percent number percent whereas other had unknown distribution
selection produced
participants showed no preference but they did show clear preference number number
preference rational because cannot contain lower both
later work showed people even when expected value other higher they more number number
several been account aversion
proposed decision particularly information especially if information known others may become available at some later point decision process
authors also suggest people about regret may decision made context information
example relatively less their setting where characteristics who experience effects
argue participants will made following selection about being if out present smaller
indeed observed aversion greater when will revealed others
important feature just unknown participants
outcome decision also not any way own knowledge
suggest if people decision domain if related outcome they should exhibit less aversion
study participants predicted outcomes games over also their own knowledge about each game
they then between they predicted would were but determined
long participants perceived probability number higher those higher perceived knowledge over domain aversion
similar findings where made predictions about outcomes number where made predictions about future events
decision domain likely reduced perception information key aversion
thus proposed perceived perceived does not independent effect its own
however other characteristics decision suggest independent effect
most people generally outcomes more about outcomes outcomes
most though not all tests hypothesis option may outcome
if probabilities option were participants might still choose option they over any effect
rather than may also account choice domains e g own area unknown area given due
another current context people not per but rather
could different effects depending its source
tests hypothesis option because not associated probability there option
instead related natural variation source
if associated option derived factors likely option would become less
above suggested options tests hypothesis should i e range probabilities rather than point estimate here take one step further options should same
finally previous experiments options were based way was
no cases was particular participants feedback domain more directly test role choices involving
report three experiments source order determine whether people exhibit aversion predicted hypothesis
experiment number participants choice between
latter because its difficulty determined
predicted would option pattern tests hypothesis but aversion
experiment number study participants option option number percent option probabilities number percent number percent
because third option due because first option participants option over other two preferences against same context
experiment also give participants performance feedback upon base their choices rather than about
experiment number standard hypothesis two options against each other while level
finally participants make same choice
if aversion independent then choices other people should those
experiment number tests similar hypothesis using different
case give participants choice among option option where they must low option where they must instead high
experiment number people options but show aversion option they against low
additional previous studies literature probability option was always i e fixed probability
experiments number number also introduce option form range probabilities
so provides even more test whether preference tasks previous tests was due simply preference over tasks
moreover terms experiment number yet different manner than experiment number where participants make choices both themselves others
report three experiments designed test hypothesis
studies include both actual choices two experiments more than one choice
people will exhibit aversion even when constant
they should options only when ability options more but when among similar options they should those lower
