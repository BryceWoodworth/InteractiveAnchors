although theories evolutionary biology predict health probability should associated subjective rate few studies tested
our study how related health probability sample individuals
contrast previous studies find not significantly related but both physical health relationship
individuals very health high rates those very good health also high rates
those expected probability high rates
therefore health probability not area world high
introduction
people generally reward rather than later
present value future reward often when there delay reward
many terms used describe phenomenon time preference positive rate
delay will used paper phenomenon individual value reward future relative reward degree individual future reward will measured subjective rate define below
although delay common assumption models choice literature relatively when why people future general why some people more than others
among various factors associated delay proposed literature review next section theory one key factor
although existing theoretical models delay often explicitly risk future risk utility future delay most existing empirical tests theoretical models rely those
between may important
if known if many potentially outcomes related could theory if some future reward could
while not either through own health through health
if related changes potentially lead changes
our study existing literature health probability addition empirical
