perform experimental using game individuals must make moral decision give not give amount money people third world
subjects asked about their decision shows at least case moral weight decision give money nature
based results presented here other experiments behavior terms moral distance rather than social distance assumption models game theory
introduction
standard game experiments one given fixed amount money set
explain money been two but only how much money how much money give
simple situation there at least three sources information relevant decision i information related i e whether not decision observed others information about information derived game used
previous shown outcome changes depending type information provided
instance when makes decision under conditions no information about no one
tend very low number percent average
however when information even while constant increase
when no information available about may existence therefore no money
contrast when were shown particular experiment up number percent subjects much total amount although number percent them all money themselves
another experiment were their would given
percent experiment part money number percent amount while number percent full amount
also increased when were when they actual existence when they were was
experiments shown if conditions e g behavior relevant information about revealed will higher although full amount money will experiment
used yet another factor may determine outcome experiment
example fact subjects they experiment may make them interest their may subjects they game they must therefore all part money themselves
nature presence taking part future experiments thus more money may also determine outcome
aim experiments measure preferences revealed subjects thus assumption behavior
individuals will their own standard assumption could lead no one will give since behavior payoff
however seen subjects often prediction setting
experimental results several been developed explain
et al show increase
authors due fact social distance they define degree subjects exists within social interaction
social lack sense produced leads behavior
hypothesis social distance been widely
concept example very sense since does not so much problem do one subject
indeed behavior
many experiments shown not so much degree but rather information about
thus example article several explain games others proposed et al argue if i know about other person if i give money i but i because i not hypothesis
according authors however explain when information about
should et al do not find evidence what they call hypothesis according might give one more many e g sense moral derived demonstrate number
hypothesis however very distinct must
although affected not if not does not allow demonstrate moral not affected but rather lack information about actual situation
et al experiment most experiments along complete lack information about necessary conditions out sense moral if shown behavior requires appropriate context most experiments what would if makes decision moral context context information example about their
experiment increase but not way
increase much more when money result effort both given case social moral likely reward
points out results experiment et al preferences do phenomenon not preference
moral preferences sense moral moral appear outcomes range experiments
yet fact occur experiments cannot any about only know preference been revealed decision whether did not give
indeed theoretical do not know why give
view following section present two experiments one one moral context asked about their action
then determine if hypothesis some degree certain either because take give demonstrate give out sense moral
