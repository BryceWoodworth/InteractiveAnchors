introduction
long between defined degree one involved e g etc
behavior e g
consistent empirical demonstrated key predictor behavior
however when actual behavior rather than studied between behavior
because more likely than behaviors social bias some less actual behaviors than seen others see
paper alternative relationship between behavior one may help explain
i behavior not per but rather
because people more likely situations where e g at etc
they may fact exhibit greater so
however tendency towards behavior will not not case when behaviors studied experiments
testing hypothesis current sets question does make people
instead when does make people
i report field experiment whether when participants
findings suggest individuals more likely but effect they likely their place
prior research between behavior considered role environmental cues play behavior
environmental cues effects behavior social well domains
furthermore stable individual characteristics e g often predict behavior task environment contains cues will appropriate behavioral
example et al find more likely support if their environmental cue some other effect even after other factors
findings significant role context making behavioral
more specifically research effects environmental cues relevant memory make them more
activation also related turn judgment behavior
example show increased lead increased activation related more positive
show when there appropriate decision e g whether people will rely more more likely influence decision making
current context i if any between behaviors found
consistent individuals been shown more when they been words associated
there also evidence suggest those who e g those who but not those who e g those who social tend more aspects life
findings suggest behavior may associated less i e degree one than extent at particular time e g due recent
when fact people more likely than people situations where e g at etc
may help explain why behavior higher people
current experimental able stable individual cues natural field setting allows us test whether factors predict actual behavior
