research shown people themselves less than others better than average many characteristics
suggest types behavior others may directly affect people's decisions
current research focus possible context behavior
four experiments found people others compared themselves less help less number more bias effect
demonstrate decisions both
finally show how perspective decision made others may affect well decisions ways might not best interest decision
introduction
research judgment decision making recent shows because cognitive biases individuals rate themselves above average across variety domains positive behavior
bias known better than average effect
example found their ability solve problems was higher than average
they show tendency among those who perform more
belief been described because group level people cannot better than average normal distribution examined
studies people typically compare their characteristics behaviors performance norm standard average their reference group
bias greater when target average when target
bias also people's judgments people their own judgments less biases than judgments others
they tend view their own decisions objective cues environment while judgments more subjective features
idea suggests people assume their own real world when others do not their they tend were subject bias
although bias may individual may negative effect decisions when decision depends belief about behavior
example other people certain might increase even when i
other hand other people will help their expected help may result no help will provided
what other people view best way may influence decisions especially when involve
well same biases
contrast decisions decisions policy often taken affect individuals
cost decisions because perception behavior might very high
moreover depend strongly support one their main when making decision how their decision will most people
preferences choices may thus affect behavior individuals
one domain behavior judgments may critical influence own decisions decision situations when help needed
individuals often situations their help needed directly
policy often consider require help
comparison not been studied domain although most likely people's judgments decisions behavior affected their others
literature other people's behavior given situation influence own decision whether not
not only people about others other people's behavior may also information appropriate do
example when person reactions others situation where help needed s may lack not critical thus not needed
person what s norm behavior
behaviors accurate
individuals may their social groups larger social environments number ways influence their behavior
one most common
occurs when individuals most their them when fact their behavior similar
was suggested one effect individuals less likely help when other people present than when
may thus lack case when help needed how other people's behavior may direct influence decision not
another effect known
account lack at least belief some people will thus own action less necessary
other people's behavior may greater influence own decisions situations more
recent research idea how other people would may influence decisions even without physical presence others
demonstrated phenomenon environments presence many others significantly reduced help
both effect based assumption people specific about others though there been no direct effort test assumptions
present experiment directly test participants well their others context behavior
most people others behavior
thus according effect people expected themselves more help than average person
present research will examine effect also biases context behavior
two biases recently been studied context bias effect
do people themselves less than others those two
studies shown people policy relative larger population at more
those studies demonstrate people tend choose options relative life even when presented comparison relative
preference model according value single life should same size reference group
identified effect people more help identified about they some even if only information than ones
situations when decision help involves biases decisions perspective decisions average other people not bias
however when bias assume mechanism will into play resulting people others more than they themselves
belief about others may choose alternative action not best their interest when behavior others relevant often decisions policy
thus people themselves more help than average person at same time others more biases context behavior than they
