research judgment decision making generally between subjective two
present research suggests assumption might
two experiments effect examine role subjective i e what participants were about physical object
us effects two factors typically
found significant effect but not object
moreover effect was were physical object
thus effect did not rely per but was result subjective object
lead individuals include object into their their reference point
potential future research discussed
introduction
presented class then them their less
little
those set their minimum too high those without set their maximum too low many clear
its value most
term effect describe result one more highly than not
potential gain was smaller than potential loss
effect since been widely
effect result loss aversion core theory
losses outcomes below some reference point more than gains outcomes above reference point evaluation choice options
if one object seen relatively large loss
if one does not seen relatively small gain
hence small study reference points thus what loss what gain
more recently researchers examine more psychological mechanisms effect
example found object increase due increased adaptation psychological new situation
present evidence loss aversion thus effect found but not thus given up rather than losses
report findings effects result having different cognitive
results suggest there more effect than simple object
present research further what leads development sense higher
concept involve two elements subjective
elements may correlated
one may some sense items one does not own e g might e g its
one may little items one does fact own e g computer require some experience use before full
propose psychological model based literature review psychological subjective
research suggests subjective more complex than simple
et al model e g through e g through actual use into e g through identification
most studies effect two elements
seems clear who they them could if they them others
they also were given physical could control them
extent elements subjective
even
indeed because control provides over might more effect object thus its evaluation than does
following two experiments examine relative subjective effect object
design allows whether effect number number both
will than
subjective sense than leads reference point makes not having object like loss rather than gain
result will lead higher evaluation whereas itself will not
