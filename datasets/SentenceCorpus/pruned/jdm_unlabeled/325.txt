our experience process methods decision research recently series
after introduction first describe process methods
then present series examples how each techniques made important development testing process models
discuss issue large data resulting process those
finally argue importance process approach findings
introduction
theories judgment decision making into two general types models relationships between input task context parameters output behavior process models addition model psychological mechanisms underlying relationships
within theories via analysis their predictions outcome judgments decisions experimental tests predictions
alternative models terms predictions them
process models other hand tested terms both behavior process methods analyze observations range judgments decisions
you risky decision making experiment you choices
you find choices theory but only uses what you evidence theory e g reference point setting gains losses probability
what would you decision making theory according choices do so according
would seen source data case
they would tend if choice output
other words would likely theory basis any other process data
process data source evidence
models aim at predicting outcomes appropriate but not models aim explain both outcome process process models
output data based natural sequence testing dependent variables predicting choice data first criterion any model process model
but first step there no outcome over process
rather process models process data should important because they than data provide important evidence mechanisms
example work who show although theory good its process assumptions alternative models
paper describe methods field judgment decision making underlying processes cognitive
will describe methods three their theoretical their core their key results
