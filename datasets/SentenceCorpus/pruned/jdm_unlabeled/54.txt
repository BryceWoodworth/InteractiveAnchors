study individual decision making task performed three different populations under psychological treatment number people who
find take less risk than but difference smaller time under treatment increases
large report themselves take any risk at all
however first treatment more than other different values parameter
introduction
since number s individual decision making under risk been one most popular studied
one hand theoretical analysis basic problem situation individuals choose number pairs
other hand empirical both variety
include experiments data
most result across all different decisions risky environment very choice task some individual characteristics
paper focus effects problem individual choice under uncertainty natural field interaction between characteristics their observed decision making behavior
since been statistical number
patients show perform specific behavior physiological activation all when behavior performed
thus several authors consider
view other authors argue patients all contrast what where behavior
moreover behaviors include increased behavior risk aversion not usually observed behavior
lack among whether could even may respect their towards their
therefore at first whether would influence way about their condition
at second could degree they more than normal subjects involving options
therefore whether normal subjects risky decision-making tasks would require first level due being second level due options
natural way more population respect their towards their population those who group
several aspects behavior been studied so far
studies either at specific should when decision making directly question whether form some cognitive bias
among different cognitive bias most probability due risky could behavior higher risk taking compared normal subjects
along studies especially while different approach higher levels risk taking they result
paper study risky decisions made subjects whose been directly affected group
furthermore study risk taking behavior people who affected because they
know whether decisions groups task significantly differ those taken normal subjects if so what way
order address question number subjects version task introduced number s further developed discussed number s et al
task designed two decision making under risk
first used between subjects
also measures degree risk aversion
second task reaction different risk
our sample three different
first number at
second number subjects first
third number subjects our control population
number s number s et al provide us much larger data set obtained normal same task under different methods
however given difference between our two focus groups new sample normal subjects
our results show exhibit higher degree risk aversion than normal individuals although their behavior convergence towards decision making behavior time under treatment increases
even more
fact large them number percent take any risk at all
second result first treatment appear more increases expected rewards than all other subjects
section number further discuss our hypothesis
section number explain experimental design
section number results section number contains
