number been demonstrated across species human development but been little decision making
paper tests about influence numbers human decisions
demonstrate individuals more higher number consistent previous research
individuals more compared those less also were more likely choose larger later over smaller particularly larger difference between two outcomes
addition they were more likely choose option larger but smaller difference compared those less
results consistent number underlying perceived differences between numbers b extent differences decisions c decision options
human decision processes involving numbers important health financial may biological processes other species
introduction
number defined presence information
allow numbers
example order objects number number their
humans perform larger using
number domain example where strong evidence points determined representation number specifically both
all area so thought involved representation numbers rather than being any specific number
researchers basic numerical human mathematical
number however limited their power do not directly support probabilities even numbers important many decisions
although little research exists processing more thought based basic number sense brain developed other number processing
goal paper develop test about influence numbers human decisions
numerical information decisions our generally assumed if provided appropriate numbers people will understand use them
less individuals however less well important financial decisions involving information
