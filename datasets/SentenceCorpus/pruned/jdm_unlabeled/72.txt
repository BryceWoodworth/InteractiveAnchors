paper recent result more than one estimate same person lead accuracy gains judgment tasks
first its whether question being asked effect size potential gains
experimental results show question type
previous results potential accuracy gains questions extended questions about
other hand no gains found general numerical questions
second part paper tests judgment practical provide third answer basis their first two estimates
experiment do not average their first two
result they do not potential accuracy gains
introduction
you been asked make quantitative judgment know when was first performed you might about
effective strategy answer questions make estimate average second just about
what though if cannot give you second
recent research suggests you could improve answer make second estimate principle own two estimates
however will depend both degree you able two independent estimates average them
previous research focused method used second estimate
focus here type question being asked its interaction how estimates generated
i report experimental results different sets questions aim more quantitative judgments
i first previous results existence accuracy gains questions what were

while i find similar gains questions about e g
i do not find evidence accuracy gains general numerical questions what distance between
what average

i then investigate whether difference degree various question types but hypothesis not data
second factor whether actually potential gains
argue people often do not understand properties
experimental data provide further evidence only small average their estimates
often one their first two judgments answer instead even answer range their first two estimates
