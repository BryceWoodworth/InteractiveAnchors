introduction
choosing between two items agent who one but not other may use recognition cue make choice whereas one who both items must use other cues one who must
less more effect occurs when agent greater probability choosing better than more agent who more items
paper provides some new mathematical results understanding when occur results
many researchers validity recognition heuristic report high rates
reported number percent rate
found number percent their number percent their samples used recognition heuristic choosing
reported number percent setting
found recognition heuristic number percent their study more than four other mechanisms
finally observed additional cue knowledge increased recognition heuristic over cases where recognition object did not any other knowledge
however empirical evidence at least value
possible but only small present less good more evidence no
simulation studies based real some support
moreover present simulation results recognition may actually increase likelihood
further some studies lack test
combined results presented paper empirical studies

define probability correct choice made basis recognition probability correct choice made when both items via additional cues
they occurs if greater than greater than number number constant number items n
view been widely used when
makes under conditions recognition
however assume constant number items n
fact parameters remains constant n them simple function n
see indeed assumption not
see how various assumption lead presence
approach problem between probability choosing between pairs items using knowledge cue probability choosing between any pair items using knowledge cue i e knowledge cue validity
i will demonstrate occur when less than
number number items number
shows rank each outcome cue rank shows their knowledge cue used choosing between two items
paper i will knowledge cue no
first let us determine
number number correct choices number
whose greater i e each number c number number number number number number number
number choices number whose rank greater than each number d number number number number
result number number number number
use similar procedure probability making correct choice using knowledge cue i e knowledge cue validity
c number shows number items than each would identified comparing other items
example first number so using cue compare other number items would choose first
contrast third number so would make only number correct choice comparing its those items actually
d shows corresponding number choices
there c number correct d number choices resulting cue validity number number number number
two number probability choosing between pairs items using knowledge cue c c d number number number number
note not
example fact probability making correct choice between pairs number items not same probability making correct choice when all number items
moreover both depending order items learned i e become
example if next learned number number then result will number whereas if next number number then result will number
if number learned next number whereas if number learned next number
examples show variation n they demonstrate both parameters take different values alternative items having same n
moreover there no relation between range possible values
greater than number number i e use any negative cue there always at least one pair items whose order cue so if only those two items been learned then number
if less than number then there always at least one pair whose so if only those two items been learned then number
same range number number depending order items learned
now up probability making correct choice between pairs items number following
those pairs where one other use recognition cue where n total number items n number items
probability correct choice when both items i e where must made
finally probability correct choice when both items
terms formula
they so using their appropriate numbers number
thus because number less than number but also number less than number so if thus differ occur when less than
when not constant not only occur when less than but condition greater than does not
one number
knowledge cue number objects number number number number number number number number number number
then knowledge cue validity number number number number
now number objects outcome number number number number number number
then number number number number number number number number greater than
however both less than so no them number number
indeed number so does not occur
i address issue how common when less than no when greater than
finally need among various
point out there at least three one comparing more less agents another comparing performance different domains third comparing performance agent new items
version been first less than full experience
but another greater than number occur whether less than
let us call local
difference between two simply
next section paper less than
third out conditions under occur under conditions recognition
effect learning items there section
