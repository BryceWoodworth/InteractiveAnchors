goal information improve classification accuracy strongly goal information payoffs
two environments were identified through computer optimization
three experiments investigated people's search behavior environments
experiments number number used probabilistic task environmental probabilities
search task subjects could only single feature before making classification decision
reward structure
payoffs either accuracy rewards associated two payoff function different rewards associated each
experiment number feedback true people later feature whether not would improve rewards
experiment number reward structure was used during learning
subjects feature when payoffs were search task
however if payoffs accuracy subjects feature was reward accuracy
feature would been most useful under payoff structure
experiment number found if words numbers used environmental probabilities reward accuracy predicts search
findings taking into account people's processes during learning current models information search
introduction
when when choosing many other situations one must make decisions without having all relevant information
there widely strategies useful
what people's information search
situations where no particular apply statistical optimal experimental design models provide one framework value alternative
variety experiments suggest models also provide description human behavior situations no payoffs
but many instance when whether whether contains whether should particular correct decisions apply
classification decisions
instance potential should if risk greater than some threshold
threshold should less than number percent would threshold overall classification accuracy
there information search different correct decisions
may best strategy allow true state nature possible take payoffs into account only actual classification decision

our theoretical analyses simulations must considered when information test question make not only when making classification decisions
other words many highly tests given reward structures
what extent does people's behavior associated different correct decisions
address three experiments using probabilistic learning
identify investigate situations goal information number correct classification decisions should principle lead different search behavior than appropriate reward given particular reward structure
environmental reward structure payoffs each correct classification decision each classification decision
examine whether people's behavior reward structures whether people may use probability gain their search decisions even when not adaptive do so
