demonstrate number alternative decision tasks effects reduced performance additional learning not inference but also seen where inference but knowledge limited
one why effects may not observed more widely effect specific values validity recognition knowledge cues
show both recognition knowledge validity may function number items
findings special nature recognition information inference discussed
introduction
recognition heuristic typically involve participants making judgments about items about they limited knowledge relative
example might presented two asked
work assumed will if they items they will use additional knowledge available make decision if they both items if they only one items they will choose larger without any other cues further information recognition heuristic
because items larger size more likely hence more likely correlation
one two items thus useful cue
if both items however additional knowledge needed make decision additional knowledge may very limited
inference give effect individuals who many items often perform than individuals who items
finding predicted occur under given if applied
nature prediction allows strong test been used heuristic
evidence also been observed but effect also been
at least introduced mathematical given certain assumptions rather than inference
observation recognition heuristic was use knowledge will reduce size
here explore whether also mathematical if those assumptions specifically if inference no but instead makes reference some form knowledge
need not appear only when studied
they also predicted models inference if those models recognition principle
used effect part their comparison integration algorithms take best algorithm
all integration algorithms were each case recognition was used cue if only one was p number
all algorithms produced relationship between recognition correct inference
however will demonstrate produced decision-making processes use inference related inference shown similar effects over rates
first aim paper prove means produced
they not unique inference cannot therefore support hypothesis
