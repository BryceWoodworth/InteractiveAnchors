introduction
hand belief been two human random sequential events widely studied multiple behavioral
often more two demonstrated independent distributed trials
probabilities up t first three outcomes produce three
predicting next outcome one would predict t
contrast one hand belief would predict
fact people exhibit two upon same past information negative positive hand belief been attention research perception pattern detection judgment uncertainty
among existing theories account heuristic attributes both hand belief belief small numbers
account people tend local sample should underlying population perceived process one direction direction
thus due
hand belief may existence hand
however account been its
suggest experience negative sequences natural events games but hand belief experience positive human performance
been proposed hand belief when people evaluate performance rather than rather than outcomes game
moreover show subjects assume positive forecasting scenarios they negative scenarios they random
further hand belief fast heuristic changes accuracy
consistent finding suggested performance based detection hand
example after making several might more difficult may increase effort
compared account alternative hand belief random process
when underlying process random independent trials both considered biases
particular both appear common patterns occur if make hand
however assumption trials states will occur often any other patterns same length its exact order
then what so special about patterns people tend them only them when they
present paper show patterns do set properties set them other patterns properties may provide alternative particular role patterns people's perception judgment
comparing two patterns t
when both patterns same probability any four trials
however average number first t but number first
other words pattern been its first
expected number trials required first particular pattern statistical property known time different among patterns due different pattern
while probability frequency how often pattern occurs time when pattern will occur time at
different statistical properties different psychological
example who when first more relevant than how often
goal paper demonstrate between statistics pattern times people's perception
important note concept time recently attention literature
show global sequence length patterns higher probabilities than t
base result they argue given people's limited environment e g number limited might actually environmental statistics
relationship between probability time
particular et al argue probability time independent length global sequence would prediction
time part environmental statistics
given different statistics same process likely they been actually people different effects people's perception
