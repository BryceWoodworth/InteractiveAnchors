propose people weight process information more than information when making judgments
cue was independent objective cue validity three studies findings support our hypothesis
experiment number participants review more when was clear than less clear
experiment number participants more weight information when was focus than when was
experiment number participants more weight financial information than those
studies demonstrate cue independent objective cue validity
introduction
when making judgments decisions people information i e cues available decision process
when whether might examine family health history results
might consider recent activity
might consider several various other evidence
so much information available how do cues weight most
models suggest should weight information based objective cue validity
according difference models people should consider all available cues might particular judgment
they should then weight each cue based upon how cue predicts outcome
however approach cannot explain how who cue might make judgments decisions
explain how people's judgments often result less information
given learning cue time propose people might use additional basis cues
account cue does not require know objective cue
instead rather simple tendency more weight information process
