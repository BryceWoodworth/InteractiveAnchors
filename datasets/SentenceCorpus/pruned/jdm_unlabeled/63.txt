binary sequences characterized various features
two rate been shown influence judgments
two characteristics however usually been investigated without other feature
because two features correlated but not seems critical analyze their unique impact well their interaction so understand more what judgments
end two experiments perception binary sequences rate maximum length i e length within sequence
results show rate unique effect judgments but effect rate length within sequence
effect maximum length was found small less consistent
together findings prior research literature perception prediction well unique effects rate maximum length judgments
introduction
life individuals often binary sequences outcomes gains losses outcomes
whether sequences perceived either random important both level cognitive processes e g level behavioral e g following up
understanding how individuals form judgments therefore critical
present goal effects two critical features binary length judgments
being times
first up
then
same true third resulting sequence
most individuals who sequence would because they evaluate not based resulting sequence outcomes
understand how judgments therefore important analyze features outcome sequences
two characteristics binary sequences outcomes rate length been identified judgments
usually however two characteristics been investigated research without other
specifically research perception focused rate while length
contrast research prediction focused length while rate
because two features correlated but not argue critical effects two characteristics so understand more what judgments
here evidence two characteristics may not only unique effects but effect one may other
particular argue effect rate length
