type decision-making not research attention search person area
many decisions where search subject made each probabilities various about where subject might including hypothesis subject search area
current study number search experience were asked probabilities person
was according support theory subjects who first considered possible scenarios how subject could search e increase their probability estimate global hypothesis subject was not search area compared those subjects who hypothesis
hypothesis was
also found evidence most subjects estimated higher probabilities individual scenarios
potential negative effects during person were discussed possible means effects were described
introduction
past two seen interest manner make decisions field
example his studied decision-making processes various types who required appropriate response their early their possible
researchers found they studied consider alternative options
rather decision making follows pattern first option selected
according their ability according their experience particular action could
one type response not studied his search person large scale area only recently become focus research behavioral
variety people become targets including other well who people
people usually under state
search system search best practice model person itself application system s all
below system will described decision making processes other cognitive variables particularly subjective judgments probability
person decision subject person report may large environment area
usually considered highly factors related health natural may
most s states who given at his any number including other other search including field search search
even before at where search will search will first usually number
upon at other search set motion subject person place seen
well subject search will usually setting up some distance
after first however will search process described
environmental who studied decision-making processes search described most there amount decision making
search no one person state best action
like described there fixed social when but contrast control search develop their one four others
during search makes search environment scenarios what likely person
search task individuals
bayesian will its basis field search along similar evidence during search
specifically involves primary search area search will then larger area into any number smaller single search e g search
identified made order those most likely contain subject relatively early
search estimates probability each probability area
well involves some probability world all area search area will likely not during
individual probability judgments then combined probabilities subject may within each well
above bayesian initial subjective probabilities according theorem person not see
because does not search will larger search negative information various within search area
indeed search world particularly respect decisions about search out new search area
process search cognitive s described his
applied term distributed describe individual using cognitive
used term distributed decision-making specifically type decisions made two more individuals
although during search may statistical data person behavior article will subjective probabilities search area become point bayesian made search
search area requires make subjective estimates probability each search area
assumed judgments based experience reference data previous person how far various types people tend before being
much research decision processes would appear ability make probability judgments ability probability events been support theory
support theory subjective probability judgments based not likelihood events themselves but events
thus same event may seen more less likely depending manner described those making judgments
example people estimate significantly higher disease cancer other natural than simply any natural
effect occur people asked consider components event various event rather than event itself
other words more explicitly event described more likely will occur
various been proposed including tendency specific effect increase confidence people they might
effect
according when people asked make global judgment probability they tend base their judgments case without example possible types
however event e g not only leads higher estimates probability but total probabilities greater than number percent
term therefore fact probability judgments described event less than version event
another important support theory those when people relative probabilities two more
example if there three b c hypothesis associated probability did hypothesis while other than b c some unknown called hypothesis
case set number either hypothesis must true
support theory each hypothesis under will support each depending manner hypothesis described example whether not
when comparing relative probabilities support s will estimated probability latter s number seen formula where number probability rather than number true
search task describe hypothesis subject search area hypothesis while hypothesis
application described using support theory
after some individual search area into smaller all represent about where subject might finally some probability hypothesis person those
at point form our own why
according single most common why person not found time had out search area search had not extended search into
similar problem s their at
described occur when become all others
possible if not indeed likely situations effects tend them their
other words all many could account person at any search estimate hypothesis target search area while hypothesis target
even if bayesian procedure used search decision hypothesis search into
example application bayesian formula applied see each time subject not found
each larger
