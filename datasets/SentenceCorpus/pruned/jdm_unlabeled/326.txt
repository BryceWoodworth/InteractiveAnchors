develop new design binary choice questions rates make their rate parameters number correlated number correlated number one rate constant while other
then method contrast different model
model based differences between present future rewards rather than their may made any other pair models
our procedure makes possible design choice stimuli relationship between different rates
however additional control over correlation between different rate parameters may require either range those rate parameters take range times must future rewards
introduction
few people reward now rather than at later people also larger rewards than smaller rewards
but when choice between smaller reward now versus larger reward later then two rules behavior
people must find some way make their choice
must also choose between outcomes at different times future now
classical all single method should value all future gains terms their present value
if money p present value will future amount following process interest then p present value future p continuous model growth model known
however people model two distinct ways
first people not they more than short term less than long term
important people will make preference simply due time
researchers suggested form people's behavioral better whose processes simple interest
second people far more likely choose present payoffs relative future payoffs than they should
seen through model present reward p people high level interest them choose future reward order greater than any would
therefore form people's size their
also been found p not just their may affect people's choices finding utility model special case model underlying behavioral model required rather than simple interest
using simulation studies shown how psychological models may difficult each other so model better people's decision making remains despite many empirical studies
models delay could taken one all how models simple interest interest
section number our analysis two used research seems support view rate parameters three different delay models all highly
et al suggest good way improve between models improve experimental design they achieve their simulations information integration models models make different predictions if trials only visual only stimuli presented
similar approach who search decision tasks between models risky choice
present article tools may between different models delay even make predictions see number number
see part their research researchers explore their computational model
