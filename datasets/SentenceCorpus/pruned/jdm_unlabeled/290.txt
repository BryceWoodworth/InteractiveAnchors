introduction
major behavioral decision research been identify situations people risk uncertainty
studies decision under risk people choose between known probabilities outcomes e g number probability number versus number
studies found people typically exhibit pattern risk risk gains losses e g most number number over number risk gains losses e g most number over number number predicted theory
studies decision under uncertainty participants choose between natural events e g number if versus number
studies generally themselves analysis risk because they rely natural events there no objective probabilities
however when relative probabilities several studies similar pattern
many decisions potential outcomes not known but must learned experience
instance might choose work only after sampling alternative several
paper situations participants learn about pair e g gain number points probability number gain number b gain number points sampling outcomes many times they associated payoff distributions see number all pairs
after sampling phase participants play real money
decision making pattern risk decision making people risk gains losses risk gains losses
basis results authors called two different theories risky choice p number
generalization difficult evaluate because no one yet defined decision making
our literature several major authors single decision number decision knowledge possible outcomes probabilities number information derived at least part sampling process
according any situation there uncertainty learning through sampling
however most data contrast single decision under risk single design
note decision under risk not only terms how information learned description versus sequential sampling but also what information available decision i e information experience may information corresponding objective probability distribution over outcomes
according information hypothesis differences information available decision will when differences
paper test information hypothesis better conditions under decisions experience differ decisions description
