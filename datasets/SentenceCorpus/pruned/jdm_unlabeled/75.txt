then research been outcomes rather than process itself
research does exist process typically social influence processes little about phenomenon key interest us here means influence one another
work reported here gain into occurs during its complexity at just one larger process

two whose judgments were then asked they might one another
present article examine some characteristics including both characteristics general sample characteristics variation across participants

construct multiple theories against presented evidence
theories compared having most consistent least evidence associated selected
if correct task requires evidence each theories set two

present article explore utility model aspects phase decision-making process i e individual judgment following evidence one another objective decision
specifically two research questions
first if between two defined one other evidence better one than another should contain reference individual define each well evidence against they must compared
does fact characteristics
second better understand how individual differences identified work likely themselves
level been found strong predictor individual therefore could affect between well
however itself level complex variable
what likely make more individual more context
here investigate level understanding likely
research understanding identified three levels understanding objective determined judgment given but does not evaluation judgment
latter levels become more increasing more individuals tend more often into latter
different levels understanding nature propose difference behavior may ways one another hence their decision-making task
specifically predict knowledge certain against theory evidence task
knowledge subjective more open multiple yet component multiple compared framework evidence
