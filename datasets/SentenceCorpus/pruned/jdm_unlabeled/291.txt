introduction
games social games stochastic payoffs where each must whether not own
more specifically each even if measure may still subject losses being one other who not
shown there wide variety significant current problems into framework against disease through individual when network risky could become current financial
shown games either multiple just single
both strategies best response each strategies
paper results analysis experiments involving two game where there single
if both measure there no either will loss
however if either both do not measure then there some likelihood hence stochastic part both individuals will loss
furthermore strategy both if they risk i e risk risk not measure despite fact had they taken step their expected values would been higher than if they had not
game stochastic game area increased interest experimental
standard game two against each other their own strategy each against each other even though both would better if they each other
game measure game
our experiment subjects were play one three types games i standard game full feedback stochastic game based model where feedback about their actions payoffs each feedback stochastic game where feedback only about their payoffs but not their actions
subjects were play games their type against each other called game
game there evidence experiments if play games against each other i e even though they would likely single game
each subject our experiment multiple number number same type i e stochastic full feedback stochastic feedback chosen
more our experimental design provided section number
our interest research area both
perspective would like compare behavior individuals standard their behavior based model
our interest whether stochastic payoffs how feedback
specifically compare behavior full feedback stochastic game where each about both actions payoffs behavior feedback game where each only about payoffs
feedback game may may not able action based payoffs both so ability loss may
behavior feedback game interest where each decision only what but
social each individual higher payoff making choice e g environment than choice no what other individuals do
furthermore all individuals better if they all than if they all
perspective bayesian model understand more factors influence individuals measures over time whether there significant differences behavior when payoffs versus stochastic
best our knowledge first time bayesian methods been applied analysis game experiments
perspective analysis us understand more how different experimental design affect distribution parameters e g likelihood against
there several features bayesian models game experiments
they include ability perform exact inference where sample likely small data understand subjects context their decisions their parameters
bayesian methods ones particularly relevant analysis game experiments
results our detailed analysis key findings paper follows
two person game individuals much more likely when payoffs game than games where outcomes stochastic
key factor difference subjects games not just what their did but also whether not they loss
when person does not but his does individual less likely next if does not loss
comparing two games one full feedback behavior other only feedback behavior overall amount was similar
however found pattern was different two types games
particular when subjects feedback game could learn their actions they were less likely their behavior than situations full feedback game where subjects learned their behavior explicitly
paper follows
section number provides theoretical empirical studies social focus recent experiments stochastic environment
section number describe general game under what conditions form stochastic game
after our experimental design set experiments section number then set test them using regression analysis section number
section number bayesian model us test respect behavior
section number findings their suggests future research
