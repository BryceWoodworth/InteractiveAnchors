method approach
technique cases where person true preferences one group trials another cases person following random preference mixture model distributed sampling each
preference between all pairs
preference between all pairs then
distribution procedure data each sample
second test correlation between mean number preference difference between also
data method
number subjects showed significant assumptions one both tests significantly more than expected
introduction
proposed solution problem testing whether choice data preference
their probabilistic choice model given response represented if were random sample mixture preferences
model was used analyze study had reported preference
via mixture model new data
much their paper including their evidence against but method part because responses same person choices independent distributed
if assumption method et al might lead tests structural properties
further assumptions more detailed analysis individual responses choice problems rather than binary choice
true error model probabilistic representation also used test structural properties mixture models will when person mixture true preferences changes true preferences during study
showed how et al method might lead when data described methods testing between two stochastic models choice
methods allow tests assumptions et al approach against would occur if person were change preferences during study
described statistical tests require samples
examples cases method et al might lead was even when more detailed analysis showed data both
methods described test would require large numbers trials however might difficult
experiment et al does not sufficient data allow full analyses proposed
would difficult data provide complete test all assumptions proposed
note shows approach possible test assumptions even small studies et al
