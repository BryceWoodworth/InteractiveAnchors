i show how about decision methods design
some argue application utility theory while others argue what they call heuristics
differences among methods i first whether each method at
design literature i argue utility theory at heuristics aim at
second i if always
important provide answer because while design objective difficult used
i argue does not always design also case problems studied judgment decision-making research
conditions under does not where design judgment decision-making research might
introduction
out method both according its consistency its performance
important when comparing decision methods because one method could while another method could
example heuristic criterion linear regression while under some conditions regression criterion predictive accuracy
article i show how about decision methods within field had judgment decision making field design
number design program design process p number
since number design
also design decision-making process
what decisions do design make
design choose among alternative
design concept detailed so predict how will function
example concept would used each part relationships among
there typically many attributes design
examples attributes concept cost
i design simply
some argue application utility theory among while others argue what they call heuristics convergence process
large
i two questions use
first question whether each method at both
design literature i argue utility theory at while convergence process at
second question if always
important answer because while design objective decision-making difficult used
useful objective relationship between two must known
i argue does not always design also case decision problems studied
i study conditions under does not where design research might
before two questions i review two methods making decisions place design theory practice
