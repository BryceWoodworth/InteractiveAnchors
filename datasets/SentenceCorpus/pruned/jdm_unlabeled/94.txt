variety life
present research suggests answer depends rate
three experiments find whereas variety stimuli even single stimulus when continuous preference when associated reduced rate
decision however influence rate preference variety
at high rates they their own high variety but at low rates people tend their own variety
results presented prior research bias people their own variety only when out over time
introduction
variety life people show even preference
whether people themselves same stimulus
indeed prior work shown people even themselves preference research bias shown people predict greater preference variety aversion than they show their online preferences
example when person might his one more less alternatives only find less at end
not only people's own but at least existing models
central most psychological theories stimuli
if people thought they become
indeed one study participants number second sample number times their experience along way
what experience less so after only number
how revealed preference shown studies bias aversion shown studies like
one key may time between
whereas studies demonstrate preference tend involve relatively long study just described involved more experience no between individual
difference likely critical importance nature
although people do given stimulus relatively
time people's preferences typically their level
just through use but over time seems same property
whereas same if may much smaller even if there sufficient between
if rate follows should influence its well
people influence rate
observation suggests they
most us same would if at same those same three would if out over
yet research seems show people their their its variety at least when
why
one time
people tend importance time when predicting their preferences if they were short ones
when predicting their preferences over instance people about how same would if time preferences
consistent time showed people's attention predicted instance preference variety
note however time preference only
extent people their because they short those predictions should more when fact short
other words predicted preference variety should thus actual preferences
prediction follows hypothesis people's choices they make
prior work bias shown people choose greater variety when future than when
should no then people degree variety they
however if our correct then also likely function
specifically choices made should increase
present research was designed test
experiment number whether aversion variety increases increases
experiment number whether tendency choose more variety than
experiment number also whether people more choices they make
experiment number results length nature relationship between preference variety
