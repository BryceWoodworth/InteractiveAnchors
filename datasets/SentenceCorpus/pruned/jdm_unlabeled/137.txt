paper models decision making under risk
contrast uncertainty effects found some subjects our experiments more than best possible outcome
show effect more strongly related than payoff mechanism
introduction
decision making often involves choices between risky outcomes
theory expected utility theory both individuals outcomes their potentially probability means binary will between outcomes
however cases where individuals value risky less than its possible
they call phenomenon uncertainty effect demonstrate its existence various experiments including real tasks choice tasks well field experiment
uncertainty effect however observed only do not involve
study small but literature robustness their findings
example found uncertainty effect design
however results were experimental
specifically series experiments they define payoff probabilities
they also
their new uncertainty effect almost
et al used physical i e good two their value instead observed uncertainty effect almost
other hand uncertainty effect fact uncertainty was number outcomes presented subjects subjects may had could result number
instead uncertainty effect occurs direct risk aversion
direct risk aversion uncertainty i e uncertainty directly into people's utility function
showed uncertainty effect where two agents fixed
uncertainty effect not if certain different utility parameters
they argue utility more than utility certain
because utility more than certain utility one gamble less than its possible outcome
paper cases uncertainty effect found where individuals value outcome risky more than its best possible
demonstrate cases where subjects much three times value best possible second
term effect effect
addition effect identify effect
three possible results number about mechanism number about i e subjects did not understand payoff mechanism number subjects derive utility being experiment i e out experiment among their
first two show likely result not underlying feature preference per but rather result mechanism
effect elements value mechanism
example value experiments subjects second
experiments subjects value difference between his value second
second strategy but show many people higher than
either strategy not being learning feedback mechanisms second
although result often taken fact associated second several more recent value studies focus all values not just tend find more theoretical predicted second
even if result second difficult primary observed here where values unknown
although subjects our experiments would people's close expected payoff not close maximum payoff
effect observed might explain higher than expected value but cannot explain maximum
use experimental design amount training about mechanism amount feedback after each
amount training allows us directly test whether mechanism may explain observed results
other hand amount feedback after each allows us test whether mechanism may more
also measured how work well their
our results suggest effect small part how work but training second does not effect thus out mechanism primary
find related effect while related behavior
paper follows next section design our experiments data analysis results
