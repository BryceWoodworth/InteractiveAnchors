often used assumption when people making decisions social
people exhibit wide range different when choosing among outcomes
people others called social value been interest many social several different methods been developed so far
here introduce new measure several over methods
detailed description new method presented along data provide evidence its properties
research would more higher measure others use new measure available
introduction
assumption central rational choice theory
decision about their own gain payoffs other them
assumption framework predict explain human decision making behavior across wide variety domains
however there preferences choices often part payoffs other thus what some
studies decision behavior long history been variety including social preferences social preferences social value
consistency construct paper
within framework assumed people their when different between themselves another person
examples may own payoff difference between own other payoff payoffs
however assumption itself particular
moreover different not rational choice theory per but rather effort increase psychological accuracy
been found affect account behavior across range decision making specifically domain settings
also been identified different emotional states
even been identified some other species also show intrinsic preferences behavior
order use full power psychological construct need measure
several different methods across individuals been developed
although use measures produced findings even approaches measures
instance some measures only output lack sensitivity important individual differences at best
other measures highly often produce consistent results subjects
yet other methods require time effort research subject order produce
moreover measures explicitly designed more like aversion
specifically previous measures not gain maximization difference between outcomes
although two related they both towards they different should both
furthermore social value continuous construct how much order make another better
best represented continuous scale
moreover since most used measures produce only data amount information related social preferences being
full power not been used because statistical power see number practice continuous variables
our view method should high output makes differences use efficient able most individual differences allow evaluation rank social preferences results all subjects
consider high measure data continuous scale
introduce here new measure into account allows greater potential through increased statistical power while also
new method measure
