research processing recognition information focused testing recognition heuristic
use recognition information was several studies while could still account choices
results if either part subjects used b used but its choice predictions were predictions strategy used
current study new approach model testing determined decision strategies based classification method taking into account choices response times confidence
most previous studies our study tested under conditions provided information about cue values objects argue common thus some interest
number number percent subjects overall behavior was best strategy
subjects using heuristic was up number number percent number percent subjects use take best strategy
analysis behavioral parameters strategy use but into question process assumptions within our experimental context
our results consistent previous literature importance individual strategy classification compared analyses

you might compare available cues manner instance region choose because you know
region usually preferences
you could all information against each other taking into account their importance also their
you might up consistent all information although classification well known would so early
because region good classification been
paper investigate how recognition information other available cue information decisions
particularly compare whether people apply simple strategies like two strategies known recognition heuristic applied situation known cue values take best heuristic version them whether people rely more complex processes generate consistent strategy
