exists when decisions affect outcomes future decisions
result increasing average rate occurs
using game models found differences decision making between drug control subjects leading influence drug use
how participants who problem
report two experiments using game tested differences knowledge between participants who participants who did not
those who demonstrated optimal performance both pattern correct responses errors questions about payoff
pattern suggested they learned knowledge change basis
they did not need full knowledge interaction leading each payoff
also found no evidence choice differences between participants who were given participants who were their performance but those given were able report more knowledge experiment they more rather than into
experiment number showed using fixed did not change results
introduction
experiments long suggested when humans make decisions they even major
some situations
one situation where changes utility options available future not taken into account when making decision same way situations others not taken into account when individuals make decisions
lead exhibit increasing average rate example increased practice also positive effects how other life exhibit average rate use increased use also effects perceived rewards other life
experiment reported participants were presented binary choice task using payoff similar those shown number
payoff each choice was determined previous choices was each option where optimal option would lead lower payoff but would increase payoff both options over each next trials leading higher overall payoff
optimal option would lead higher payoff but would payoff over next trials relative optimal option
option leads payoff although any single option would give number points
authors found most participants did not learn their instead option payoff
suggested choices made according principle global rate
not new do not take into account although past models generally used time theoretical preferences
validity was who found patients were more likely choose than control participants may than others taking into account full their decisions
further evidence between research found level brain activity associated performance task
same area studies using task related various including
suggests at level could effective if method were found improve decisions tasks involving
series experiments without participants choose
reduce participants choose between two options
they found however end their experiment participants were still levels authors their data suggested participants would at level was
two experiments also understanding payoff how participants could their payoffs
found choices were only but levels
provided similar but found no corresponding at all
showed participants could long they were given feedback about how their compared optimal outcome they were given number number trials learn
suggests choices game not stable decision-making bias but rather due learn payoff
experiments choices either affect number points number choices end experiment
however so both number points number choices end experiment were affected choices
two outcomes each decision so effects were through number points each number choices end experiment at rates depending upon history choices
other words high payoffs through experiment but experiment further payoffs
each decision made outcomes each decision more so participants learned choose much than previous experiments
also task understand payoff
nature outcomes choices made may not so into simple
so if results experiments useful understanding decision-making occurs process participants learn choose version
one process could result into payoff participants able report
research into task found participants were able explicitly report their understanding task
present experiments test knowledge payoff find out what participants who able report about payoff
experiments tested knowledge series questions designed every task
they used quantitative test understanding been shown more than tests
experiments also tested whether making number points they during task had effect their choices
particularly literature seen participants way
participants condition were based number points they whereas those certain condition were fixed amount
possible could participants more thus gain more points participants would not explore they would so would strategy leading points
if however not leads performance experiments using but rather cognitive understand payoff then difference might not expected
