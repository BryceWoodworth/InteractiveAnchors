recently been observed different choices made about risky decisions depending whether information about outcomes their probabilities learned description experience
current evidence respect whether choice samples
current experiment whether bias exists at point choice decision alternatives measured both judgment
found when estimates were participants presented information description experience had greater tendency events common events
choice however even when judgment effects sampling bias
indeed estimation outcome distribution did not their choice
choices may derive process does not explicitly use probability information
introduction
recent years literature two different choice description experience decisions observed each
decision experience one where possible outcomes estimates their probabilities learned through integration observation feedback environment
example might decision where you make way work
contrast decision description one where all possible outcomes their probabilities explicitly out
example might decision work after
recent evidence found decisions made under two different choice
example presented binary risky choice problems participants either described
description outcomes their probabilities were form choose between number certain b number probability number percent
participants choice task make decisions consistent pattern choice gains losses when probabilities were high but gains losses when probabilities were small
example number percent participants certain number decision above
experience participants were outcomes their probabilities had learn information sampling two
each sample presented selected outcome taken underlying outcome distribution same structure problems presented description
participants were free sample often any order they they were one option play real
participants choice task make decisions pattern choice
example only number percent participants certain number decision above
some call development distinct theories risky choice
however et al data
specifically they found theory could account patterns choice when based distribution outcomes due sampling errors was often different objective distribution outcomes derived
relative importance sampling bias
issue number produced results
