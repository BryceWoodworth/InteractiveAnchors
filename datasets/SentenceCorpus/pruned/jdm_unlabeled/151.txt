introduction
although about change human problem significant solutions its impact
change will almost require reduction but upon who should reduce how much thus far problem
despite change issue show what reduction
paper show difficulty part due tendency what also
bias not intrinsic differences what distribution may represent primary way
one might consider social structure problem other change
paper structural they needed first place
particular solution distribution
paper role bias fundamental about
take part change differ potential including their levels past obtained problem
research bias shows between relevant bias because people place greater weight support more themselves
bias been shown play central role both studies field studies
moreover because even below what they because bias leads there often no upon all will even when large gains available
large number involved change makes problem even not only increasing complexity over above would exist only two but also number possible
selection consider following study
subjects out were then given money was themselves well another person study their work
if other person was given amount time work many subjects average money both time work
but if other person was given long number subjects instead norm money themselves
finally subjects more than money both case where other person was given much time out many case time
subjects time work criterion depending was their own
context change difference focus some policy per others relative versus developed
et al show agents involved policy tend their
furthermore agents more likely other than they themselves were so
though evidence consistent bias et al propose et al study cannot rule out there differences what differences lead independent role
indeed judgments between provide evidence
while two similar judgments health risk scenarios subjects tend give other more weight less likely consider option best option overall
domain consider their own more if was given better than if was given better while less
number found were more use power than
one general pattern judgments tend more context dependent than those
extent judgments influence role bias may give most
particular given importance change whether bias fundamental differences what perceived
using experiment role bias
because cannot individuals effect their judgments approach concept first proposed
judgment social made people who do not know their own because they do not know what role they will
application based observation few would if they were whether they were ones who would
explore how judgments resulting individuals situations they their own not
presented subjects graphs current per two one
different possible could was subject number per over time both
subjects could between one all one other all other they found they most
states one three scenarios degree they were their own e were
one designed show impact bias made domain change well two involved states
second using b also nature environmental problem so subjects would was about change
third problem even further between two
although scenarios multiple relative between were all three
our goal research not suggest real policy though if so were possible would support
our demonstrate simple experimental procedure effect bias possible effects differences
so us bias role
our findings also suggest bias policy may value
