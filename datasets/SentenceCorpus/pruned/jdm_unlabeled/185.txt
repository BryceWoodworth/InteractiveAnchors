experimental test principle presented
principle utility will their even if information about probabilities losses
people assume they when they
results experiment support principle
introduction
principle if utility choose between two but random they will their each
principle following means if two utility same value same distributions potential losses they will gain potential losses
principle any distribution outcomes long distribution same both people
does not whether probability loss small large both cases people gain loss
loss also if information about probabilities losses
not even necessary distribution outcomes same both people they both there no assume their probabilities losses differ
possible differences therefore if there no knowledge about them
when information about probabilities losses losses may since based information probability losses
without information will become arbitrary cost may large
under when information about probabilities losses may not possible at all
however without potential loss
principle was first presented case two
principle case where losses differ amount probability case where differ
paper tests principle experiment
particular test following two number under people will potential losses
number if distribution potential losses different across people but unknown people will still potential losses
experimental design results presented number number number
