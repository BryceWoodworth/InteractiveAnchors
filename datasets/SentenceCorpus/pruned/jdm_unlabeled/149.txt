introduction
among most factors
there been interest specifically mathematical quantitative
more basic levels real number time estimation whereas higher levels focus understanding probabilities
much research involved wide range mathematical among large samples
more recently however research theory decision focused subset important accurate risky decision e statistical
paper use statistical specifically understanding probabilistic statistical comparing probabilities
statistical aspects key features risk play central health risk communication
risk many psychological theory long decision making under risk involving known statistical probabilities quantitative probabilistic
ways others statistical one factor risk e ability information about risk
indeed statistical been shown predictor decision strategies reactions choices across many risky health decisions
measure individual differences statistical risk three
some research risky decisions relation individual differences overall cognitive cognitive
other research health domains developed subjective
most common however use objective performance measures e tests
paper review development most widely used statistical
then introduce new test statistical risk e test
test used multiple i e computer adaptive multiple choice fast research
specifically show new test unique predictive validity other cognitive ability tests e g cognitive memory
furthermore show test among individuals e g across different
close construct validity underlying mechanisms applications e g adaptive risk communication
