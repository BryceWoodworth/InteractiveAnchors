introduction
all our make decisions
choose where when our pair
fact each step make our life result decision made
even if do our choice
would if could always make correct decisions order resulting utility yet result information subjective behavioral biases
therefore understanding people's behavior important both predicting their future decisions potentially decision quality
decisions make may into two main
when study drug risky including probabilities possible outcomes
decisions based statistical called decisions
when whether their during typically possible outcomes example probabilities explicitly provided
many decisions all rely our own past experience
decisions based past experience called decisions
tasks typically studied under tend focus decisions based detailed information relevant outcome distributions
tasks typically studied under do not provide objective prior information payoff distributions could
other hand decisions thus learn experience
between risky decisions recent attention because same information lead different choices depending how information
difference usually difference treatment outcomes two
one hand tasks according effect events likely if their probabilities explicitly presented
other hand tasks outcomes may either because events not likely occur recently experience reduce events simply because small sample size may events not occur at all during relatively short time
example may example given consider decision whether against
who research effects site provided their will learn up number out number number will high about number out number number will result
increasing number after information not their
although same statistics at their they also information not available experience across many patients
information them very result effects
few will one cases high
if they one experience free
one sources differences between may result differences weight given events like likelihood function whether likelihood through experience statistical description
situations often base their decisions both their own experience
settings possible construct choice tasks based experience
our major goal determine models best explain behavior two classes decision tasks
previous studies behavioral characteristics groups people our study choice evaluation parameters individual
moreover examine between choices same description tasks
out experiment involving choices
so our decision tasks more situations each choices made between two binary involving probabilities both gains losses
examine common behavioral characteristics tasks number decision learning models number factors parameters loss aversion sensitivity probability choice consistency degree choice tendency past information current choice
first use two models i theory was developed tasks model was designed tasks
addition three basic models find out what parameters would most human behavior at individual level comparing same choices two types tasks i model similar without assumption sensitivity gains losses model similar but assumption sensitivity model utility function similar loss aversion parameter
tasks order account effect learning model should contain explicitly probabilities
therefore models probability parameter tasks
other hand order effect learning models decisions should contain parameter
models criterion
first all classical models were designed description tasks will prove more than their possible tasks
our findings based support
furthermore people tend terms decision-making model parameters
thus better models should also provide higher individual parameter consistency
other words individual who according certain model relatively high low values certain decision parameters certain task should according same model relatively high low values same parameters other tasks same choice
sensitivity assumption behavior our experiment may rather limited due nature
since tasks combined model found model terms parameter consistency
finding other results models involving linear gains losses perform better both tasks
finally behavior should also consistent between different choice individual parameters having similar description tasks should correlated
hypothesis only learning models may still need further
