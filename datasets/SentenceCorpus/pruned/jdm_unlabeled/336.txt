i describe discuss recognition heuristic model decision making
after history up its current version i evaluate several specific assumptions predictions its framework recognition process cognitive process model conditions testing measures using not using strategy evidence effect part
may help better understand further theory develop future research
introduction
one heuristics adaptive recognition heuristic recognition may high level accuracy decisions
example if asked two larger b given one but not b one may simply recognition cue larger
domains probability object related its criterion value here size simple strategy will lead many correct far above
strategy recognition heuristic defined using only one evidence recognition two objects no
no other knowledge about objects inference process could decision based recognition
thus case decision-making strategy
especially some past new empirical findings
other words thus model one number researchers our knowledge how decision making may
new set studies special issue recognition processes decision making
following section section number i basic features its underlying assumptions at its its version
main part paper section number i then discuss main points its framework
note i do not provide complete review all theoretical so far
