introduction
comparative evaluation theories issue fundamental importance all
general many particular theory derived hypothesis empirical tests through
although tests between models given predictions derived more common their comparison more
specifically underlying assumptions predictions derived each particular model tested
over time each model
according classical model relevant tests
question better theory model long model makes predictions critical tests
there approach research been testing critical properties central assumptions single models
indeed series conditions certain effects theories
however testing properties single models been
follows test specific hypothesis derived single model against number alternatives
rather need compare alternative models directly
popular approach several models directly compare terms their ability account empirical data
one particular specific research strategy classification approach identify decision strategy individual most likely used
following idea people set strategies models compared level individual subjects model description how decision
current paper focus comparative model testing general more procedure strategy classification particular
following notion good test theory one high theory identify two major existing approaches comparative model evaluation number between random error number global model
