recognition heuristic basic psychological recognition order make about unknown world
article review our initial work including between recognition evaluation process
there now evidence i recognition heuristic predicts individuals even presence one more cues people adaptive decision increases larger recognition validity situations when validity low presence cues some individuals appear different strategies
little known about individual differences how model alternative strategies
although some researchers judgments use recognition heuristic processing little research models been reported
discuss recognition model open questions results predictive power recognition forecasting
introduction
recognition memory limited search point was only small step towards recognition heuristic potential information lack recognition
computational models recognition principle was first called was other heuristics order model memory
was initial could function model same type was recognition heuristic
recognition heuristic was not derived manner
finding one was not its
had probabilistic models theory situation effect would
his set out test prediction needed two sets questions one one
questions populations so thought
higher when tested sample than ones
result experiment
how could people more correct domain they less
our research group cognitive process makes more out less
finally out was et al article probabilistic cue
if person one but not other lack recognition larger population
participants could not rely recognition too much
discovery also revealed condition recognition correlation between recognition population recognition validity sampling
condition later
one possible why us so long find answer was our training classical statistical models
linear model cue predictor its same true rule
principle parameters known data but not predicting what one does not know had do
good cognitive heuristic however should well
people could do better less knowledge generated much interest social
may number idea less being more test effect their number more less program
new were asked whether larger population
studies his one us had found about number percent compared number percent corresponding group participants
not known studies so were about whether they could effect
but they did
new number percent answer whereas number percent did close one
our initial work recognition heuristic theoretical above all
work much understanding potential simple model but also its larger research practice
change occurs three our review made two key processes use recognition heuristic recognition evaluation latter judgment its
