people not only losses gains they also positive outcomes
when money between probabilities people often negative into positive ones even at cost reduced expected value
results experiment revealed number preference turn negative outcome into positive outcome exists when people's ability do so depends their performance levels rather than their choice number preference when likelihood turn negative into positive high rather than low number preference when people about their performance levels them turn negative into positive not better but rather about how well they performed
introduction
losses larger than gains losses more than gains especially when
losses gains however people positive outcomes
people increase probability even at cost reduced expected value
tendency into large losses real life people number they rather than total amount they
specifically among people multiple et al found evidence account aversion people small first even though larger had higher interest rates
people's psychological need turn
studied people's tendency increasing their probability positive outcome using probability
participants were asked they own gamble following payoffs probabilities number number number number number number number number number number now i you you change gamble above one two ways
you number outcome number you number outcome number

although expected value gamble remains constant outcome participants money all outcome had same probability chosen number percent participants money outcome increased their probability positive outcome e g number increasing probability positive outcome number number number number
number percent money alternative outcome did not increase their likelihood e g number
et al further found number percent people who considered following gamble number number number number number number number number number number their number number outcome rather than number outcome them turn one negative outcome into positive outcome thus increase their probability gamble number number number number
although people influence their outcomes how they often also able influence their outcomes task
example multiple tasks their people must choose task they will first
they may choose more task choose task likely take least time not so
people's less tasks their might lead them more tasks they
current paper situation people influence their outcomes one multiple outcomes value function their task performance predicting outcomes multiple
specifically current work whether people choose their negative outcomes into positive outcomes thus increase their probability positive outcome
additional questions here whether tendency when likelihood turn high rather than low when performance needed negative outcome into positive outcome relatively rather than relatively less difficult
finally i whether settings people may their performance levels i e reduce their sensitivity objective turn
address questions i asked participants points one three outcomes b c one
participants then predicted outcomes number one point per correct prediction
points were only
after participants task one was selected determine outcome
points two number number
had positive initial outcome number points c had negative initial outcome number points while b had negative initial value could potentially turn into positive outcome if participants predicted well task
specifically i whether initial value b made likely turn initial value number points turn initial value number points
people probability thus turn negative outcomes into positive ones they should likelihood negative outcome into positive one
when likelihood negative outcome into positive outcome low i e when task possible but relatively difficult due initial value people should less likely choose outcome
contrast when likelihood negative outcome into positive outcome high i e when task possible also relatively due initial value people should more likely choose outcome
relative likelihood task however only when performance when people not able their performance levels their
contrast when people ability about their performance levels difficulty task less important people rather than perform order achieve positive outcome
question whether situations people their performance levels may lead people less attention likelihood being able turn
other words when people improve their outcomes will likelihood i e low high initial value no relevant
