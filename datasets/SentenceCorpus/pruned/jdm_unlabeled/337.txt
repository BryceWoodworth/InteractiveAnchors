several predictions heuristic makes empirical tests focused proposed processing recognition
some authors heuristic based tests use recognition
although tests clear i evaluate value tests they
first i argue using measures use recognition recognition every
second i how tests based response times lead if fact recognition heuristic does not model recognition judgment itself
finally i two key but so far aspects recognition heuristic between recognition memory recognition heuristic b mechanisms underlying adaptive use recognition
introduction
his suggested good memory not good decision making
fact seems decisions even memory
how could possible
one answer because structures often world memory making about world
notion judgments dynamics memory been taken up several models decision making
instance proposed p number about world heuristic based might when people probability frequency
more recently described recognition heuristic model how people recognition memory when making more generally
contrast heuristic recognition heuristic computational model search decision rules
moreover recognition heuristic was proposed adaptive specific conditions
recognition heuristic makes several predictions about recognition its use decision making
first recognition heuristic assumed rational i e environment recognition should correlated world
second people's use recognition heuristic should structure environment
third recognition heuristic predicts recognition recognition should further cue knowledge
finally heuristic predicts under certain conditions effect where objects lead more accurate than more objects
recognition heuristic its assumed role adaptive made study object
not not all empirical found evidence heuristic
several predictions heuristic makes seems assumed processing recognition attention so generated
some authors need tests recognition heuristic developed measures use recognition models measures b tests information processing inference based response times
following i discuss value tests they used argue they little our understanding inference
addition i two key underlying use recognition decision making been result strong focus testing processing recognition
first need better understand relationship between recognition studied memory literature recognition memory recognition heuristic
second i how people might their recognition across different situations
i do not argue measures recognition predict data should
rather i call more way use findings models decision making
