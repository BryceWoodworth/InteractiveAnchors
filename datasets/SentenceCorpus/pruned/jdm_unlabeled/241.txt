introduction
researchers long decision making adaptive process individuals making between accuracy effort
however et al suggested tendency when making decisions may variable they between individual difference
whereas some people choose best others tend options simply good
his proposed difference may represent general behavioral tendency they developed scale between decision who tend those who tend
et al maximization scale across number experimental studies
was over number participants s number number
results tend best option not simply option good themselves best outcome rather than good outcome
addition relation between maximization scale range psychological including regret subjective showed not only do exhibit different decision-making but they also appear experience different emotional decisions
they experience higher levels regret than less more less than
they also more affected social comparison especially social comparison than
thus strategy seems not only associated choice process but also experience after choice been made including life whole
phenomenon context choice context experience been
studied found more obtained almost number percent higher than those
despite their relative however were less outcomes their search more search process
other domains researchers examined impact maximization behavior regret
since maximization scale was first been studies different maximization construct interest researchers various domains
given increasing interest maximization scale its properties
current paper factor structure validity maximization scale also several scale
development maximization scale important because especially when maximization not interest research short scale will allow researchers include construct large studies without making long
more important existing maximization scale because both past research scale current set analyses reported below suggest original number scale contains several items tend not perform well thus should considered
addition original et al study suggested scale could into three distinct factors one choice difficulty one difficulty large numbers options one high
been since existence three factors
further analysis both because factors suggest different psychological processes because original et al results were less than respect factor structure
analysis below suggests number version maximization scale not only but actually at level original number scale
also define more examine three maximization reported et al they predictive various psychological characteristics
therefore future researchers examine not only maximization but their well
having yet more measure people's tendency should research examine how people's during choice process affect their decisions choices their
order original maximization scale develop version properties four sets analyses
analysis number consistency maximization scale using datasets maximization construct
analysis number uses same datasets develop maximization scale number number number
analyses number number validity developed scales et al analysis number developed scales using datasets previously two new datasets analysis number additional data further developed maximization scales
validity consistency construct validity
paper evaluate maximization scale using all then develop several scale comparison
process maximization scale set rules consistent past work
our analyses rely proposed et al
consistency measured construct explicitly construct validity validity
furthermore procedure et al order common short scale development
research presented here based analysis datasets new data
there were number datasets total over number number were obtained several authors across several both s see number
