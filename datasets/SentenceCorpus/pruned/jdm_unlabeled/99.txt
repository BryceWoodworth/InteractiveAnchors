introduction
principle
far some number years some form behavior both situations
importance most number number number life life
their part importance negative actions their more positive actions
one key taken research within social general important negative actions individual greater behavioral response than positive actions
fact best words et al who provide several study positive negative p number number convergence evidence however across different were most important evidence
no area were able find consistent one could good than
find any patterns despite our own
hence must than good at general level
within results example loss aversion people more negative than positive uncertainty important role mechanism design
terms latter decision problem if agent behavior number available
manner between example important role outcome
more generally loss aversion one most robust general behavioral patterns social
study explore general setting theory provides predictions positive should than negative
two key features agent short end being out provides less utility than being
under design initial reaction will find
who will more likely next
since being predict will will not initial reaction
other hand if will strongly since situation not only but also
thus situation positive will than negative
test our theory design simple experiment several
first literature agents
when interactions negative more important than positive but not significantly so
also literature fact agents become when
yet emotional does not actions when features place
example when agents form they much more positive than negative stimuli
second data suggest source behavioral differences observed rather than change social norm setting
our study follows
section number contains experimental design
section number experimental results
