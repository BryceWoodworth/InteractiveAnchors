generated
empirical phenomenon examined one
gamble real
found were typically lower than payoff thus much lower than generally
also examined several

found were affected gamble were strongly affected gamble initial value gamble
one call heuristic strongly predicts data
subjects following strategy evaluate gamble if they were taking rather than mean payoff distribution
finally argue distribution outcomes
so form statistical mean expected value so expected value
gamble
results suggest use statistical heuristic
introduction

proposed number up
number if first payoff each time being given at first number shown number

gamble expected value most people they should not more than few play
why people small play gamble expected value important question

many including including

idea utility now central concept
moreover interest utility turn theory games behavior
despite importance
there no widely low values most people place gamble
moreover there little empirical data

present study review several major classes then provide empirical data designed test
