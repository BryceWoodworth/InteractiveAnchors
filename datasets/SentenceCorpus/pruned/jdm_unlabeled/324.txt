one major statistical judgment decision making research identification individual decision strategies selection tasks tasks predictions strategies differ
more strategies considered larger number dependent measures taken into account strategy classification more complex selection most tasks
suggest task selection method solution problem
according experimental tasks selected average difference between strategy predictions any prediction space
model simulation evaluate influence task selection identification rates strategy classification
strategy classification shows performance comparison less task selection algorithms sampling
advantage particularly large if only few dependent measures considered
also provide function free allows predictions most considered strategies set tasks those tasks via thus apply no prior knowledge necessary
introduction
identification decision strategies always behavioral decision research
there at least three approaches
structural modeling regression based approach identify relation between criterion variable cues judgments process methods example information search use decision process whereas comparative model approaches investigate data predictions different models determine model decision strategy
comparative model particular recent judgment decision making research
paper discuss problem task selection when using strategy classification method
suggest task selection method solution
