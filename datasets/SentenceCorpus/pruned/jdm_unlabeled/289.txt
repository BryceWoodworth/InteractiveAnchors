our findings support hypothesis decision same basic processes additional decision
introduction
according assumptions individuals make decisions rely their
although between two types information processing now widely judgment decision making research relatively little known about cognitive processes them
different models rely processes might considered account see
models range cognitive evidence sampling network models more approaches
furthermore many theories between processes
long models clear between
out models many but all cognitive others
despite basic properties framework been being not
second fact evidence theories based outcome measures while cognitive processes underlying were
furthermore theories models according simple
one models into three classes according two decision was made
first class theories characterized initial selection between two rather distinct processes
instance selection models might under class
second class theories activation both processing among them might result responses
assumption most strongly other authors view well present consistent evidence
third class theories models state processes always first processes may upon processes
instance heuristic processes generate responses processes might potentially correct initial response
similar network models argue processes basis every decision only processes if necessary
number had suggested not distinct cognitive processes between people
rather they seen cognitive task factors influence how far one one other
present paper used analyze level how information search integration
specifically tested whether decision different information integration processes
at first question theoretical issue models whether assume distinct whether both might rely similar basic processes just additional processing
follows first discuss theories special focus whether they more distinct more processes
second describe probabilistic inference tasks discuss related
third introduce core measure single used investigate differences information processing
derive both distinct processes perspective
