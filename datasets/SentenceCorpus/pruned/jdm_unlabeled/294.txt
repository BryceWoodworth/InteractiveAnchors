introduction
current study based field study
study perceived number after end two regions region was under during central region was not under
number affected was
many were some their number their
effect was most work
indeed had impact upon
generated other negative among population
number study examined effects number among two regions was under during was
current study compare risk judgments individuals made at time number risk perception individuals same two regions number later
first study was number while second was number number after end
addition one number sample used experimental design short during number
participants group about future risk judgment after
comparing samples number number without us examine addition sample data us compare two theoretical approaches approach version tendency approach
paper follows section number literature review section number main study section number methods
