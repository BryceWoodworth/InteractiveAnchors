effect tendency people themselves less likely experience negative outcome total number people increases even when probability outcome explicitly presented
experiment number effect two health scenarios using original experimental
experiment number showed people also themselves less likely selected number people increases
experiment number showed explicitly number people expected selected effect experiment number showed number expected affected health without total number effect
propose therefore effect related bias
both effects occur when people make risk likelihood judgments based information presented
difference effect occurs when relevant more than while bias occurs when more than
introduction
many situations there numbers
person group less wide variety than person who
consider example who at
if person group less likely less likely more likely help event
however there many other being part group makes no difference
example who at local
if were found e
then person would just likely after group after
there evidence however people tend latter type situation
people numbers
first effect presented one scenarios they were e g financial risk asked them probability they would experience associated negative outcome
one his scenarios example follows
disease
disease over number more than together
although rate not high disease total loss

group number including one
how likely do you you will disease if you one
each there was condition was you condition was one number people condition number number people were depending
across all scenarios there was strong tendency participants give lower probability judgments number people increased
furthermore function group size perceived risk was
there was large perceived risk condition smaller condition
effect proposed occurs because people use heuristic
they apply general rule i larger group even when group size
according heuristic could cognitive mechanisms lead humans many other form social groups
mechanisms because there often numbers
individuals groups better able find find
but effect result generally useful rule
our present research effect was
first because there been only two studies since was
one basic effect
other was only effect states effect being observed only two scenarios tested
results open out might play role effect
because both more than states participants those might more number people more likely apply heuristic because their greater sense control individual control
important therefore effect states
our second research was consider alternative effect
specifically thought might result people's number people risk more than other information making their likelihood judgments
consider two scenarios
one number person expected taken out number people
other number people expected taken out number people
probability any individual will taken given number people expected affected number people two probabilities example same number number number number number percent
however if people weight number people more than number expected affected then they would lower risk when number people number than when number
note there no component our theory
people do not weight more than because makes them
they weight more because more
potential problem idea there research phenomenon called bias seems show just
when about based people weight more than
example asked people choose between two
one they would if they selected number where one them was
other they would if they selected number where between number number them were
many people second they were greater number
shown similar domain risk perception
his participants various when rates were presented they weight more than
example they risk cancer greater when number number people out number number than when number number people out number
bias also been shown influence perceived based dna evidence
our however although people weight more than many situations they do others
furthermore relative
terms been used demonstrate bias people might exhibit effect likelihood lower when there number than when there number if their attention total number rather than number ones
one way do might present number rather than explicitly total number along probability one number percent
consider situation described following popular who people's mathematical questions
family up but what you
i you choose numbers same whether number number number
they better if only number

although same how many family appear number because most one presented explicitly
scenarios used similar our example example above they attention relevant number people
while all scenarios number people them explicitly presented number people expected affected
one his scenarios probability negative outcome was presented e g number percent cancer but given difficulty people understanding probabilities seems likely number highly information more than presented number people expected affected
similar been other researchers although not effect
example et al greater impact certain risk communication methods occurs because methods number people expected affected more than number
example graph compared risk associated two terms number people expected affected produced relatively large differences what people were two
however et al found graph shows both number expected affected total number who use each produced much smaller differences differences produced terms probabilities
however found no effect similar
they presented people information about various terms number people who per number who per
example frequency cancer was presented number per number number per
number time
researchers also condition number was made more e g number people every cancer
condition time was made more every number people cancer

consistent research bias they found most people condition than condition effect
however had no effect
our research effect states two health scenarios occurs participants more
experiment number but new context
instead scenarios used scenarios participants had money
our was if participants effect positive outcome i e money then effect result heuristic applied response
result would consistent however idea people simply weight relevant more than
experiment number show effect when change scenarios include relevant well
finally experiment number show explicitly but not effect direction bias
all results consistent our effect result people's relevant more than
