individual true error theory responses same person same choice problem within trials based same true preferences but may show preference due random error
between true preferences may differ same
theory studies testing two critical properties models risky decision making number original theory specific way both theory heuristic number stochastic theory
random error most individuals stochastic out theory
furthermore most people way predicted theory heuristic
both consistent attention model
no one was found whose data were theory those were also expected utility no one heuristic
introduction
when choice different individuals different preferences
example given choice between number gamble either number number some people choose others gamble
when same person presented same choice problem two individual may give two different responses
given two between possible part all what called individual differences may actually choice behavior
furthermore when test structural properties theories theory may due responses rather than true theory
therefore study individual differences need true differences between people differences might due variation within person
furthermore study behavioral properties theories need determine whether real might instead response
report two critical properties models risky decision making first order stochastic
apply individual true error theory random true models risky decision making
