often research judgment decision making requires comparison multiple models
researchers global measures rate correct predictions various models part evaluation process
measures often very high level between predictions various models does not relative performance models those critical cases where they make distinct predictions
address important problem propose use models produce more their performance procedure data two recently
use models
also demonstrate how model performance signal certain models perform better given subset decision problems
introduction
field behavioral decision making large degree
after certain empirical researchers test multiple models some some new explain result
example every model decision making under risk expected account classical
when new models proposed researchers often them series against models field
there several approaches testing decision models
context models there focus small problems chosen between certain models
others data multiple studies involving decision problems selected different researchers various often compare how well models predict them
alternative approach compare ability predict decision behavior sample problems well defined problems
all methods data set n decision problems models
each problem there one empirical response decision number n take one many binary choice probability choice pattern numerical value probability estimate etc
set predictions number n generated various models
there ways evaluate models full review well note
our sufficient most them based some function d between responses predictions across all n decisions take its optimal value case n predictions
thus one always rank some cases also scale models according how close they
some simple examples functions correct predictions predictions b mean d where could rely d d their d c relative measures relative d d measures based likelihood function data under certain model etc
approach review some few studies report results four model using different data sets total n number decision problems n number n number n number n number
they compared number models used several sets parameters models free parameters theory
their measure was percent correct prediction subjects choice across all n decision problems each data set
they also report percent correct prediction choice percent between all model pairs across n number decision problems
similar approach used several research group
considered n number decision problems involving number subjects three experiments compared number models see number their paper
their measure was overall percent correct predictions
et al three model each using different decision two problem sets n number each set
