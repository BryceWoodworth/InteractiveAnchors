strategy risk relatively new research
past research complex tasks settings cannot identify specific aspects decision-making affected
example simulation game they report number total decisions previous feedback resulting large financial losses errors
settings global outcome measures reported
recent number studies found outcomes many decisions were loss
thus applied studies measured decision parameters free
even task been used examine risky choice behavior literature does not allow risk subjective probability formation latter results fact there information respect outcome probabilities
et al issue showed risk
general mechanism decision making remains
given many decisions involve multiple cognitive processes important examine several those components effort determine may specifically may not
studies risk preference above examples work
another process found many decisions ability multiple information into decision
might subject one more information decision-making
new information may response subjects new evidence may following
current study specific decision-making through study bayesian
experiment subjects both after number number number number number total
comparison previous research rule experiment
one examine effects ability information into decision at least two each their own
one involves whether individuals true bayesian probability given base rate probabilities new sample evidence
requires subjects their judgment actual probability event therefore finding answer problem
although approach our interest was weight evidence when actual choice was made i e was more likely occur
more many decision environments life
example one may two now given prior knowledge rate each new information current time
may perform procedure given prior knowledge relative procedure new information current condition
short when individuals make real decisions they must often choose specific action i e choice rather than probability estimate
influence making decisions our interest
because information fundamental component decision making under uncertainty research relevant wide variety behavioral applications
research towards information under
however more direct evidence needed lack research specific decision models
behavioral explore decision-making one cannot evidence many often some degree
