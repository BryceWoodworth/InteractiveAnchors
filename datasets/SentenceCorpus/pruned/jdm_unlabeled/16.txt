common belief more information always better et al showed simple decision strategies rely little information
simple strategies depends both about structure environment core human recognition memory
however between environment core been
how interactions could within cognitive

here focus decision strategies show how strategies particular environments depends characteristics core cognitive recognition short term memory
introduction

better than was before

next across field objects at distance his
like most us would better if were
would better at least would had better if had been cognitive ability complex
another view cognitive human those may important functions
most important function memory not simply all information but provide us important information specific situations
view human memory system way information recent context
way system information most likely need
many feature view
when open program recently
effort through
work however must provide they actually
does so considered needed basis assumption time since was correlated its likelihood being needed now
if you where you useful where you before
there evidence also other domains cognitive while too much even performance example learning
view adaptation environment program fast heuristics position humans cognitive strategies heuristics solve specific problems
et al called cognitive strategies adaptive
heuristics not but both structure environment core human
cognitive strategy simple core recognition memory human through evolution learning highly little no effort
consider heuristics adaptive strategies fundamental psychological mechanisms p number
within fast program between environment been detailed models core
models heuristics specific core recognition memory without core directly into model
other words models heuristics many other models decision making how decision making will affected interaction between core structure environment
goal paper how cognitive modeling interactions decision making research
particular cognitive explore issue
principle other cognitive models memory could used relation between environment memory performance inference strategies
fact main findings memory function inference strategies would same long model memory was used
one model but bayesian analysis rational analysis
another good would been shown account wide variety judgment including example heuristics
relation between other models will discussed more general where will also how could extended tasks those examined here
