phenomenon observed
when choice between two individuals choose greater number potential even when smaller probability
current study experiments phenomenon test existence bias distinct general
moreover examine effect size depending treatment extent choices within framework
existence bias
moreover existence significantly extent effect linear response changes size within investigated
introduction
consider following problem you asked either two
contains number number
b contains number number
do you choose
rational probability will choose
many individuals choose b when presented choice similar choices
phenomenon individuals choices large numbers potential rather than large probabilities potential
present phenomenon along two
first test errors within framework
example above not only present participants decisions like one but also decisions larger number greater probability therefore optimal choice
if similar errors two then there no real phenomenon but rather observation random error both
if frequency decisions across however then phenomenon exists
second dimension interest
experiment decision well introduction small testing its effect
combination within design test effect decision making well size test effect decision
