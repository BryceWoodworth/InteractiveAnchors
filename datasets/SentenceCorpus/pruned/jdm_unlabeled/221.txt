our previous research suggests people obtain life outcomes
here examine whether finding may decision-making
et al find more likely show decision-making less behavioral greater others when making decisions more decision making greater tendency experience regret
predictions were more likely report decision making
however relationship between life outcomes measures other decision-making decision-making variables
introduction
behavioral decision research behavior terms its consistency utility maximization
research revealed both consistency norm
latter include alternative good rather than option expected utility
strategies they cognitive effort any loss expected payoff
decision-making research focused general processes underlying theory instead
more recently attention individual differences decision making whether through preference ability individuals make decisions consistent ways across tasks situations
individual differences been examined include risk aversion risk judgments preference rational dependent decision-making decision-making
work et al developed scale degree individuals report rather than
items when i i often through options even while one program
other items ways one might explore much information possible when making choice
given many options often available life e g no small
because strategy people who do so less well life sense less life while more regret
moreover individuals who may less decision-making
example make more social regret about what might been
they rely more information sources might lead them further question their choices
thus decision-making may very so achieve
even when better outcomes those outcomes still may not
found recent who described themselves number percent higher but less during search
one possible one compared feature while other features important
were case then those who may make decisions despite strongly
decisions lack compared may situations like those propose
consistent et al found people higher et al scale had lower measure decision-making described below number p less than number
addition also reported outcomes decision outcome number negative life events might decision making
events range their frequency include having having being having been type number more likely among people who made choices
analyses et al focused measures
context et al maximization scale was one several comparison measures
result paper reported but not other decision-making characteristics
particular analyses did not examine extent lower decision-making account correlation between life outcomes
here examine question using et al sample
whether tend report several decision-making
one measure behavioral taking action difficult tasks rather than them
because may set they should report less
other measures decision-making scales
should report number more rational decision making their perception about their choices number less decision making number more others information number more decision making decisions search more information number less decision making sense taking more time
finally report greater regret about their past decisions et al finding sample
take advantage et al sample examine how variables
finally examine whether between two performance measures reduced after other
