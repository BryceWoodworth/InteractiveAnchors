current study construct validity maximization scale maximization tendency scale well construct
find both scales especially their proposed
using factor analysis response theory identify three items items
find difficulty search best alternative whereas more focused search best option choice difficulty
then examined scales relation other psychological found may not but generally decision-making context
finally suggest future research use form seems us most consistent original concept
introduction
construct attention years
models choice individuals maximization goal decision-making
however evaluation existing data models organisms well they do not general
research et al define psychological effects those who
specifically they environments choice individuals goal would likely regret their decisions
et al developed number measure maximization maximization scale found correlated regret correlated life
since development scale there been about validity measure development alternative measures
et al developed new maximization scale tendency scale found did not life
however their scale did regret
et al number scale was found better characteristics than original number scale
also developed new scale found correlated need but correlation between measure regret was across samples
finally et al examined both using response theory found both scales had construct
they also found was not proposed et al
however et al did not discuss items
current study examine both using factor analysis then use problems found scales
addition test whether solutions answer question whether
