policy many factors including but little research examined stability preferences
paper one way preferences depend question asked
participants how they would fixed between two individuals who different money either amount two individuals amount
was described amount money rate were
there was strong metric effect participants more when was described rather than amount
however there was also clear interaction participants significantly more when money rather than no effect was found
introduction
issue
recently states there been increase one s was increase rate just under number percent
recently will introduce new higher number percent people over number number number number number
several like states recent years introduced where all same their no what its value
systems generally multiple often
most goal potential taken high rates work high rates
another key potential using example between
although issue strong about optimal one area often extent appropriate ways psychological mechanisms affect preferences
existing data give
generally when asked whether those higher should higher rate people
however people's preferences appear depend way questions
example found when participants were asked questions about form rates more less than rates some strongly was more other studies
however when asked questions how much more number number should relative number number same participants preference case response being should
other hand showed both questions finding better state other
found participants who preferences at different
not given large body work shows preferences often way options affect people's preferences large number
effects been specifically found preferences
example demonstrated several effects participants who different family situations
among other they found participants system was described terms certain groups rather than other groups were even though situations were
they also found what they called metric effect participants more when levels were described rather than number
finally they found effect participants were towards initial structure
one finding et al was participants were less between questions when questions were terms amount money after rather than amount
furthermore authors note their pattern results reference point produced p number although was not tested
effect further at least two
first although people about amount should people different seems most direct way preferences people about money after may more people's experience hence greater stability validity likely people more able report how much money they take after not least because amount their than amount money they given
second psychological associated relative amount person able do amount money they after other
suggests determine people's preferences should use
experiment reported here effects two variables design effect versus money effect metric effect investigated interactions between two variables
features task similar those used et al using two who different
however response method different
et al paper people were asked about form if number number how much more should than
then scale same amount much so may bias people towards much most available
