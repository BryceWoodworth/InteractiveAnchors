research shown terms influence behavior
behaviors been found behavioral than
research also seems certain features
present research test how presented affect number factors health related
consistent our hypothesis found our focused task increasing number increased behavioral when subjects were via negative affect
significant effect maximum number negative
account influence health discussed
introduction
people their behavior so more no
health at people more life
either more way life one
how individuals particular importance health since direct human health quality life
understanding how problems may affect decision choice were theory
central work people will depending upon how decision problem presented
specifically decisions may presented manner either positive gains negative losses aspects task
effect positive negative decision choice effect
because decision distinct
between three types goal
because most research choices involves many health goal
goal contain either gains positive not losses negative behavior
feature goal decision specific behavior remains same across
consider example provided were given use only its gain loss
both gain loss same behavior were similar length structure
one gain was using increases
corresponding loss not using
subjects reported their behavioral use via actual behavior was measured number people each condition who later
consistent their previous research gain greater levels behavioral actual behavior
health related been found greater behavioral behaviors while been found greater detection behaviors
behaviors those behaviors little risk perceived
detection behaviors those behaviors some amount risk their performance
previously investigated behaviors include use use
thus relative advantage gain behaviors been well
while analysis provided provides structure types does not address potential interactions may exist certain psychological variables
they point out goal more than other
they also how goal several within same task
present paper set out examine two variables identified being particular importance type task affect number presented
body research examined how affect influence decision making
although many different how affect information processing decision choices one affect information account proposed
according view negative affect signal people they may not their state goal given task
their attention task at hand people become more involved task
other hand positive affect people all well they do not need out any additional information
result people less tend not out additional information task when positive affect
one way either positive negative affect involves affect stimuli image
affect information view research shown negative greater attention response than either positive stimuli
prior research health found gain greater behavioral tasks focused health related task use here
further part may number presented
general should increase number increases
however effect should determined both task
if participants not task because positive affect cues then number should particularly
predict behavioral should not differ function number when positive present
other hand when context contains negative affect cues decision should more task
our task predict gain should increase number increases
however because less effective behaviors suggests decision will less involved task when
predict number will less when problem
increasing numbers should most when negative affect cue present gains
