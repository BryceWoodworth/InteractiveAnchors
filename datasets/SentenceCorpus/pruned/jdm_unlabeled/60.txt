three experiments was significantly reduced participants consider all possible outcomes event
each was presented range possible outcomes into estimated each likelihood including true answer
subjective probability estimate method robust range
its effects observed even estimates made using number percent confidence method who first made judgments considered range values estimates well
introduction

among factors estimated value question defined rate increases value
value according best judgment potential will increase
however when negative value i e value will was was error following errors rate must number between number number number number

among its errors individual they know future change
typically measured confidence range values certain degree will include true value question
research found confidence people their their accuracy confidence they produce too
pattern observed well judgments
had limited
people's confidence their more search they evidence than evidence their
their experiments participants were presented two possible question answer they thought was correct reported their confidence accuracy their chosen answer
they were when they expressed very high confidence
however when asked consider evidence their before their confidence participants reported lower confidence levels
search evidence their participants at range possible values
so instead their participants number percent confidence they asked their participants number number low there was number percent true answer was above number number so high there was number percent true answer was below
using approach were able reduce
other research reduce question
research found evaluation based probability judgments fixed less than
example participants asked number percent confidence produce but other participants who estimate their confidence report less than number percent confidence their accuracy
findings proposed adaptive method judgments
using method confidence level determined
produced specific value generated either at random estimates probability contains correct answer
if probability higher than confidence level presented next if initial probability lower than probability then presented
procedure probability confidence level
authors found resulting procedure less than were produced directly
reduction made different response e g confidence their form change methods did not affect cognitive process estimates were produced
