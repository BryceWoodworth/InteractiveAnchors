three experiments frequency presented stimuli design
experiment number judgment pattern
actual frequency were
were almost actual were frequency
show however tendency towards judgment pattern obtained conditions
attention during experiment number stimuli experiment number increases judgment sensitivity biases both frequency
findings underlying memory mechanisms discussed
introduction
event frequency fundamental importance behavioral adaptation
instance increase their if they approach where more time
should where
consider individual who must where probability function frequency length time certain area
assume individual who often different past observed behavior
further assume observations made would represent sample
order his own behavior environment should use temporal information his choice
requires two first individual must differences frequency second frequency must memory so they used later judgment decision making
various studied processing frequency
their approaches however differ
research short term
cognitive often memory processes whereas researchers consider heuristics
different theoretical apply different research at
consider example case frequency judgment
cognitive learning frequency knowledge usually find participants make accurate judgments
they explain their findings reference general models memory
researchers often investigate factors changes judgment accuracy explain their results reference heuristics
between research been often but there increasing number researchers towards integration both theoretical level paper report studies using research cognitive knowledge about frequency
compare judgments two related domains judgments judgments frequency
conditions their effects patterns
specifically compare differences their sensitivity differences their biases
approach increase our knowledge fundamental memory processes
knowledge may help achieve better understanding judgment
introduction give state research processing frequency at hypothesis memory
evidence organisms good at differences frequency
like humans even low range n less than number
humans like many other species able temporal information across wide range even
very short range particular seems very accurate
all together research findings suggest common mechanism both stimulus frequency
findings one may assume frequency would also affect memory similar
according hypothesis number frequency would effects representation judgment instance they may both change event memory
changes could different theoretical approaches memory
models frequency may change associations among its features other network
models function number stimulus event at least if response constant
other being number assumed increase function frequency
may also increase function because may event
underlying mechanism hypothesis same property memory used judgments
should made through memory
one main prediction derived hypothesis should
should while should frequency
empirical evidence hypothesis however
evidence research heuristics assumed use memory predictor quantitative judgments
example when heuristic individual thought estimate criterion stimulus stimuli memory
heuristic similar process more stimulus due previous higher estimation criterion
notion some studies provided evidence biases
example words number number number number between subjects
they found frequency judgments were
specifically were shown higher estimated size higher probability could free test
found similar effects
design they number number number number number effects frequency judgments
both measures were correlated
were found frequency
showed judgments time number available events
reported evidence frequency stimulus but see paper next section
taken together findings support assumptions hypothesis because biases
test however requires us consider two other aspects judgment pattern
one relative biases other judgment sensitivity judgment sensitivity degree differences frequency judgments
end one must compare within same experiment
approach was applied memory research
paper frequency four levels number number number number levels number number number number number design
after asked participants either frequency each was shown average
found showed sensitivity actual differences
moreover were only affected differences
judgment sensitivity was lower
another difference previous section were actual frequency
pattern results differences sensitivity bias hypothesis suggests frequency affect memory different
reported similar results studies
all together empirical evidence research suggests frequency memory
findings reported so far form
biases occur do not
more biases than but there also evidence
there several possible evidence
important one type judgment task between studies
some studies use tasks some use tasks
most studies biases used tasks
participants estimated size different
contrast biases less tasks judgment event
another possible conditions may differ across tasks studies
frequency requires little attention stimulus
one must simply stimulus occurs
however requires individual attention stimulus its presence
differences may affect stimuli actual
literature time perception notion attention variable time processing
differences result patterns might differences rather than differences memory
without conditions might hypothesis
present research role conditions
three experiments total frequency stimuli within same experimental design
specifically stimuli frequency number number number times total they number number number
resulting number frequency number design was always within subjects
following stimuli participants made
specifically they frequency its total number number number its single average number generally pattern judgment central dependent variable
two into account judgment sensitivity biases
judgment sensitivity extent individuals able differences stimulus their judgments
biases type memory representation underlying judgment
experiment number study did not control conditions
experiment number different conditions focus attention during
experiment number different types stimulus differ likelihood attention stimuli during
