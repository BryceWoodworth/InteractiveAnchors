researchers argue should because they result research subjects study
was tested several experiments
two additional experiments were given studies asked what was find i e research hypothesis judgment decision making were asked predict how well would perform task
whole were identify research hypothesis when provided version experiments
furthermore were their predictions design
introduction
field there over appropriate use between
greater power less but many researchers their use two
first been our research
design subjects will our experiment may thus validity experiment
second some life more similar design
therefore increase experimental findings
however others their own
particularly subjective judgments design should because results context stimulus
most principle was provided who showed design subjects number number being significantly larger than number
design two conditions single stimulus
case stimulus was number being number number
however subjective judgments cannot made they require context
design context two more conditions compared each other
design subjects construct their own context evaluate stimulus
when case very likely different will different stimuli
example number likely other numbers comparison thus number relatively large number
contrast number likely other numbers comparison number relatively small number
thus design both stimuli context between conditions results
although relative may what more tested two often do not result same
example base rates do not affect judgments probability leading base rates
however base rates large significant effects judgments probability leading base rates not
despite about using evaluate subjective judgments others design out many
particular within judgment decision making there exist many findings almost data
examples include bias research choice support theory many heuristics biases
researchers more appropriate
one main belief
although popular design been tested
thus literature two specific research
first aim was determine if examples could using
