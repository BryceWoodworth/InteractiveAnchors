introduction
been shown increase phenomenon effect
most effect value call loss aversion based observation loss greater subjective effect than does gain
literature suggests individual gains
used term effect
extended notion although adaptation following complete adaptation likely take time
suggested adaptation need not because individuals may not either loss
series experiments they demonstrate increases items people own well items they past
however several recent studies suggested effect may affect even i e before actual place
example between their even actual
found increased preference manner similar
et al showed simply about option sense option increased sense loss after choosing alternative option
findings consistent work who observed making option focus comparison its perceived probability would selected
suggested change reference point good
they note after good may if they
result suggested who good may increased
if true then should adaptation following physical contact contact
article effect i e physical contact two experiments makes several literature effect
related experimental work found terms number was affect
however our work first investigate effect where amount time participants examine before
performed two experiment
different levels amount time participants examined before their
first study participants
second study participants online open
data both studies suggest manner similar time greater thus higher
therefore show effects observed study do not appear rely per but were result increased subjective increased physical object
our findings also suggest subjective may affect much more than prior researchers
