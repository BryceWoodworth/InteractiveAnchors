introduction
past since was recognition heuristic much research
been studied point view some at times
many other empirical studies question whether what extent recognition cue considered how often actually used
whereas some show case others conditions possible individual differences tests alternative cognitive process models
model makes exact predictions about choices underlying processes
however gain about whether under conditions predictions actually correct must also
although many research strategy individual heuristics yet much less clear how study measure
what may at first appear rather question out represent view source much
so far been appropriate
indeed et al provided questions
they suggested no less than critical test should their view
also they literature many previously studies respect points
however even if their studies features had not been does proposed if taken rather small empirical yet problems when measure
i will problem what follows
central point et al argue more likely used when objects cues must memory
assumption memory more often based simple heuristics assumption support past
central objects decision through experience thus learning recognition when appropriate
those who like into rule out participants objects them cues how measure use when there no control over cue knowledge
assume judgment two larger one but not other
if provides judgment object higher criterion value choice produced
however cases cannot recognition was considered thus do not provide information about use
more generally may prediction cue question actually some different information points same direction
case comparing example decision may chosen based knowledge large like
thus so long there no control over further knowledge specific prediction
simple choices model us almost about underlying strategy p number
best recognition further knowledge if participants certain objects cue patterns typically when other heuristics alternative approaches full control investigate whether additional cues degree participants
indeed different cues when simple strategies
moreover full experimental control over cue patterns allows application methods strategy classification proposed between theories decision making observed choices means model
bayesian approach provides information about decision strategy most likely generated data vector
recently approach been extended choice outcomes response confidence
however both approaches all cue patterns set objects so between different strategies
at central et al who call using objects without any further information
overall most only three information available researchers must base whether was used i objects were presented given including their true position criterion dimension objects object chosen higher criterion value
how based information measure
so far three classes measures been applied
rate measures based rates model
what follows i will introduce measures discuss their theoretical present simulations existing empirical data evaluate them
