three studies examined factors may information search
people generally uncertainty typically them relevant information
despite strong information search people delay information
find they may do so when they information might future
decision search information not only value importance information itself but also related possible effects negative knowledge may future
introduction
yet
why should they know their
since too too
thought would their
no more where
suggests because short because only time before experience should over knowledge
consistent notion provide here three empirical people belief
present research examined factors decisions information
when potentially negative information could future people would information after event had
specifically suggest choice potentially negative information at least determined i e future events
consider instance case while out
if help one make financial decisions
indeed because importance making decisions people generally exhibit strong search information
however people less likely open when just before they order
information at not either uncertainty associated also
cases individuals might thus uncertainty before
what then whether people would search information
propose when whether not themselves information people expected against those
thus individuals determine whether uncertainty hence search information
