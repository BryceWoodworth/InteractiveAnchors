introduction
based his observation what would become large literature various social
observations was even intrinsic aversion those who other groups without explicitly themselves high levels could result being too much relative
when one exists large number us not result among either group
model shows example when people any at up their different group one should predict into no individual explicitly
do not individual
particular judgment decision making researchers lack was between decision-making process spatial dynamics
one might very simple model complexity other social where into lead e g empirical versus theoretical common social other within
yet model widely used analyses at all levels local state well among many
although model new literature remains active there important between theory empirical observation relatively little attention
model predicts high levels within very large set initial conditions parameter values
yet empirical studies various e g types among types among work types among variation extent social groups observed
whereas world variety outcomes theory does not account variation function variables parameters within model questions
model real world data

model agents recognition memory
agents apply heuristic
key our model into recognition memory
at same time fast common experience local experience formation relationships thus underlying quality process quality its associated memory i e positive negative inference would been made based group
according fast common experience quality e g versus without group when those experience taken place past
when those whose classification according group i e
when other person heuristic based group same model
however when there even small amount experience quality experience past how other people
based recognition memory group basis classification agents both models
given assumption experience past influence classification others us could not find any previous model direction
model shows when agents short single maximum only number individual out larger population produce significantly higher levels integration
key comparison investigated paper variable degree recognition memory e g no recognition memory model versus any positive number those one remains memory
variable recognition memory representation environments few many random agents model novel source variation into model
effect recognition classification better understand why some environments at levels interaction i e high levels integration while others into pattern
model policy analysis simple relatively design produce other groups
then extent people use rule based recognition random could potentially generate large stable levels integration too out studies based model
paper follows
model review previous research related our present model between its predictions real world data our
then introduce heuristic model model model special case
present series simulations effect recognition memory decision rules their spatial distribution environment
