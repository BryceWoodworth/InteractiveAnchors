effect been over number years
recent research suggests focus attention might play role preferences
two studies investigated role attention effects
derive predictions extended version evidence models bias based
test predictions against alternative account effect result initial differences
both studies time constraints standard find effect time increases
study number use find focus more value attributes than value increasing attributes
attention role value effect
introduction
one major behavioral decision making research improve our understanding processes underlying judgments decisions
what now considered work fundamental biases judgment choice rational behavior been demonstrated
recent research focus towards underlying cognitive processes effects
way information used construct preferences values become primary interest
one effect been studied across variety domains effect one theory
basic assumption theorem good should under assumption
been shown good higher than same good leading reduced
effect related aspects thus been effect
effect robust although phenomenon been observed using various approaches including also preference mechanisms
been found occur both values
although there no research effect more work needed understand underlying processes still under
several theories been provide effect
based theory loss aversion leads increased good perspective compared perspective because good loss while same good without gain
research mechanisms differences focus level good question also explain effect
cognitive mechanisms often been suggested alternative account
example argue effect focus between i e money i e good
theory suggests different process effect situations information memory
individuals memory aspects support e g good money than later also information against
several experiments showed order into were perspective could explain effects
furthermore order they found effect was strong role information search effect
account showed appear better representation positive features representation negative features good compared
p number both groups more features their position
because its memory processes does not make direct predictions decision tasks relevant information about good question e g attributes probabilities outcomes make up gamble provided during phase
based findings however one might predict there should similar attention well
following will application tasks theory
one class process models explain effects both tasks i e memory evidence approaches
particular sequential value matching model decision field theory been developed model process objects e g risky
model compare gamble against set possible dynamic stochastic process
first one possible between maximum minimum outcome gamble
if gamble more than considered increased small amount
if gamble less small amount
process
point search process different methods context conditions
specifically high whereas low
over time both towards range
however results between
model been shown explain several specific related between
most account observed preference loss aversion cannot
furthermore model been shown able predict choices observed previous studies well decision times process data
model account effects without assumption attention points e g within range higher range than studies however attention both preferences
suggests place mechanisms suggested model there likely attention positive value increasing negative value aspects option based perspective leading aspects resulting differences found effect
assumption attention based perspective set related evidence
if sampling based perspective i e factor effects difference between should increase over time because constant bias sampling increases difference between considered good
should case at least early decision process while still being search not yet been
our first specific hypothesis number effect hypothesis
due bias evidence between will increase increases time
if contrast effects suggested increased time should instead lead size effects will average up
hypothesis provides us our alternative prediction study number
using study number test directly whether focus perspective whether our second third
number sampling hypothesis
sampling evidence will differ based perspective will focus more value attributes than
number impact hypothesis
sampling evidence towards either value increasing will lead corresponding increases
explore whether attention dependent probabilities outcomes predicted evidence mechanism general also central model our
number probability based sampling hypothesis
sampling outcomes will part dependent probability those outcomes
furthermore although memory based account apply two its underlying information processing i e direction early greater impact than later online information via attention test two further study number
do so based finding visual attention been found processing online information well
number focus hypothesis
will more value more value increasing evidence but there will increased focus information over time
number early hypothesis
evidence will greater impact than will later evidence
following present discuss results two studies
study number find increasing time predicted our first specific but prediction model
