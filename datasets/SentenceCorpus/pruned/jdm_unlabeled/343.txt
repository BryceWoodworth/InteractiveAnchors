introduction
how does knowledge affect judgment decision-making
while much judgment research considered role made under certain make their knowledge
example asked both
percent number percent were correct
all had but only about had
would therefore able apply recognition you one not other you
people usually about before smaller e recognition criterion being cue will some validity
because had both they cue had rely other less cues
terms accuracy seems when using knowledge make less mean more
specifically when validity recognition cue validity knowledge applied when both items less more effect predicted
less more effect two number about number one about number
each was number selected pairs number
they found were more accurate about than
furthermore who found were more accurate at making decisions about than about
despite experience learning about seems one more accurate when making decisions about less
since initial experiments further research extended our understanding conditions when effect may occur
another experiment recognition heuristic predicted found subjects predictions recognition heuristic number percent was recognition heuristic
more general theoretical point very simple heuristic using very limited knowledge make accurate decisions
even because simple heuristic like recognition heuristic so take advantage structure information make good
particular recognition heuristic when specifically lack recognition rather than distributed when strongly correlated criterion
particular interest us here recognition heuristic uses rule
even when other information about alternative available weight simple recognition if one object other not then inference determined no other information about object therefore no other information choice determined recognition
consistent their recognition heuristic decision rule reported evidence use recognition cue was presence other information
give more detailed account their study general but short they their were than those without number percent possible
yet when choice between they did not one they did not but might number percent pairs
thus additional information about had no impact decisions where recognition heuristic was
number studies show recognition at least general sense role prediction including
studies did not test use recognition heuristic similar but distinct heuristic judgment relative heuristic most criterion value
other studies use recognition
example found two experiments people did not place any special recognition
most their subjects learned use information when was good predictor when was predictor
they found little evidence recognition any other cues environment
note although results show recognition may given information they do not show natural recognition information memory
their recent review research into recognition heuristic discuss what they identify number number number studies given information experimentally recognition domain recognition heuristic
study others tested use recognition been who most studies testing use recognition used experimental situations differ potentially critical ways situations heuristic
according et al test recognition heuristic uses natural cue knowledge rather than same setting choices even test cue natural two experiments
moreover according et al research should test cases where recognition good predictor criterion also knowledge other than cue knowledge could criterion knowledge e g very small so another could allow decision make judgments without inference were about
experiments presented here investigate how people use recognition et al although like do test impact information presented information rather than information memory
while issue was not was first introduced recognition heuristic
further who identify recognition heuristic describe tests recognition heuristic using given information domain recognition heuristic
although their own test impact information tested use given information cue validity did not provide what describe cue information about may why made no reference notion their own test was domain recognition heuristic
indeed they result hypothesis recognition heuristic was applied way p number
our first study examined predictions two different groups subjects who like studied would expected different knowledge domain
number long before about recognition rather must judgment
studied predictions
expected subjects very little knowledge domain while subjects would good knowledge
although predicting not same making about were able test accuracy predictive comparing outcomes games
given very limited knowledge relative often make up might very often their only basis making
so although did not recognition heuristic when designed study measured those they had no at order examine relationship between variable their
were also able study effect additional information judgments
after they made their initial provided them investigate whether their additional information any integration additional information their judgment
