investigated how frequency amount affect decision making subjects
our first experiment version task our subjects lower than their
moreover our subjects more more had less but larger comparison had more smaller
our second experiment subjects did not between same frequency but different
however among same amount but different frequency significant preference was towards less frequency
our results differ previous studies different strategy risky decision making among subjects they show low attention amount more frequency
introduction
risky decision making defined cognitive process individual available options according value reward associated choices
based previous obtained information about possible outcomes options
factors amount frequency reward probability their delay their influence more choice subject
various studies shown decision making also affected emotional each option based previous
when making choice decision current situation some previous experience previous choices
options history larger more more rewards more effect our reward emotional processing systems therefore more likely chosen
fact our subjective may bias us make decisions not rational but
research decision making general subject populations same
due need single population based models also because influence decision making become interest both
influence probability judgments risk perception risk preference been researchers different
report subjects more because they larger social case losses
addition they found differences not due differences towards risk rather about how risk perceived
social known variety
when choosing between short term long term more than
people even if over payoff future
over well current affect different aspects people's judgment decision making
many others similar influence years
there not been experiments decision making
paper report differences comparing results subjects results same test performed
due factors multiple changes years perform their
moreover investigate effect frequency contrast amount reward among
close about some potential some differences
