using cognitive task task examined using several other quantitative measures performance
criterion only at properties data without standard
experiment number n number out number number addition problems under time
experiment number n number also target different
within each experiment same responses using different methods
tasks accuracy information mean correct answer using criterion was available accuracy information using criterion mean target also was available
participants according each measure then compared using
order correlated number
however different criterion degree model did not either accuracy
generated correlated number generated
were also available both experiments they generated correlated highly those
did not well performance evaluation
introduction
evaluate work necessary performance
while all their most ability perform task well
performance also key whether training program
objective rather than
quantitative performance aspects work typically outcome
how many were
how many patients were
outcome measures what they focus directly
outcomes also compared example should theorem
type standard criterion
two types compare performance standard against measure behavior
indeed some researchers argue performance measured only when standard been upon
just would help about way evaluate theory paper about how performance
many domains simply not available
what outcome quality review
empirical does not
they suggested at its core
task one must relevant aspects situation what do
evaluation what does identified two necessary properties judgment different stimuli consistency similar stimuli
presented number two properties
large when reduced when
two properties not independent
strategy one property at other but both at same time requires accurate evaluation stimuli judgment number when they proposed were about measures
concept any measures two properties will do
applications generate numerical data including present ones been using terms analysis
experimental design analysis may simple each several stimuli more than
means different stimuli
mean between stimuli
given stimulus presented multiple times different responses various
mean between
approach criterion properties behavior
however other while performance high values there no theory optimal behavior
our view performance world should model their task
however not always possible know best model often unknown well
optimal does not practical importance having evaluate large class who provide about people
more popular approach subjective domains compare responses those other people
often
often been proposed correct although so been
simply people may
one may view criterion there exists across people common structure underlying their
current tasks there were optimal responses
accuracy using criterion correct rules
accuracy usually using criterion how close its target
goal present research was ability subjective domains objective domains
