very small but may sufficient significant effects even over years
two studies one study other study examine effect position different
items at end their options were up popular when they were
given effect items at less ones their e g should result some increase choices
introduction
problem world
via
paper et al present two not here
they then suggest could not only
small often changes choice i e manner setting choice set presented do not affect choice set itself yet affect different options
et al very simple if you increase make
same present paper another possible
show at end its increases its compared
present their
when items presented
when items presented
our study involved only
items may various ways type e g etc
according main etc

within each they typically
when does order
one may two how literature design psychological literature position effects
position effects stimuli presented their dependent variable not usually choice
but effect called preferences bias effect choice among presented various findings people options ones
when items not when options presented they chosen more often than when they presented its
studies do not apply options position may important place
rather they use options why position would i
number people choose
what position people place tests
good they choose set
what they etc
all studies found rather than choice set its
only three there seems advantage being first presented choice set rather than its
asked their subjects consider linear number pairs fact their subjects were not found position effect object was also was p number
contrast real data was almost like study order was p number found greater when first than when any other position p number
finally asked choose between two points either real
point could not but chosen had same total length number
showed preference making first turn possible
cannot into first but possible points taking first turn sense
contrast all findings both first where one should place items whose one
however were research best our knowledge exists but not clear why one rely much memory when
moreover when other impact empirical test their question
p number was
however since they did not study bias specifically no direct results either contrast reported above
present study therefore did not bias either against items but rather whether one exists using number testing
