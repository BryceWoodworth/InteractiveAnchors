introduction
biases emotional judgment decision making
forecasting particular type emotional judgment involves predicting how future events will affect emotional state
forecasting significantly influence range important life choices including decisions testing
effort potential biases forecasting recent studies examined how well predicted emotional reactions actual emotional reactions life events
research shows forecasting error people often emotional reactions future events
key forecasting may people strategies emotional reactions events
phenomenon been tendency strategies other aspects psychological system reduce future
three studies provided evidence but studies directly strategies used participants events
initial study showed people aspects its potential influence making
study participants predicted how they would event they negative feedback either source computer source
source feedback did not influence predicted emotional reactions but actual emotional reactions response feedback
study provided support when forecasting people might strategies being able information source
study examined forecasting losses
study were found significantly correlated actual emotional reactions losses but were predicted reactions strategies were not
finally third study examined forecasting loss
cognitive processes memory were associated better emotional after loss but had no predicted reactions
studies factors cognitive processes were predicted emotional reactions however they were related actual emotional reactions through influence strategies emotional reactions life events see number
time basic research directly testing hypothesis
recent health called emotional processes underlying decision making
further recently been reduce health behaviors lead make financial decisions
research effort decision-making processes
most likely effective when they empirical evidence
direct evidence understanding essential development future will use findings forecasting improve decision making
past studies cognitive processes associated actual emotional reactions life events but not predicted emotional
three factors thought influence actual emotional reactions through their effect strategies
no study strategies mechanism forecasting problems despite decision making health
therefore present were examine more directly b increase our overall understanding key
order examine directly present study used data strategies used participants life event
strategies using data
furthermore strategies may more robust than measures predicting emotional response life events past studies may actually
central hypothesis study was strategies would associated actual emotional reactions life event but not predicted reactions source bias forecasting
study was also designed identify our understanding phenomenon
event influence
been suggested may only apply forecasting events events do not need strategies
however research many events e g major actually including could use strategies
thus role life events further
second may across time emotional reactions
emotional reactions response life events over time empirical evidence whether forecasting more difficult more emotional reactions events
thus present study examined whether participants were more likely more effects strategies upon their
finally could experience
several studies examined predicted actual emotional reactions life events determine whether people learn experience make emotional judgments more see
findings been whether predicted reactions reactions less bias
thus present study examined both predicted reactions
research determine situations where most relevant potentially future forecasting
current prior work i forecasting number number
studies those other demonstrate emotional reactions events involving relationships
example how they will event having how they will if they do not
current involves primary analyses existing data relevant was during second studies et al
present research distinct prior report different variation actual reactions rather than predicted reactions associated forecasting error responses
was strategies data would associated actual emotional reactions but not predicted reactions source forecasting problems
analyses also examined whether function event event those those without after two after type emotional judgment predicted versus emotional reactions
