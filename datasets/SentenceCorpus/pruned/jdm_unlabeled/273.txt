scale graphs study demonstrated new evaluation bias
graph scale relative distance respect options given thus information
experiment number showed differences had significant impact evaluation
experiment number scale effect different extended context
experiment number effect scale distance other variables e g scale attributes further finding experiment number
results graphs very different same data
finding not consistent theory
experiment number also tested importance hypothesis but evidence participants did not more important
finally related our findings impact visual processing decision making discussed them perspective cognitive theory
introduction
people often focus single problem when making decision
limited focus bias decision making process leads results theory
information e g way preferences options could some cases determine information perceived thus what people would focus decision making situations
evidence means preference e g choose likely focus decision
case found people who had option choose focus positive attributes whereas people who were asked focus negative attributes
result occurs when same option was choice both choosing
view reported effect description options
when decision was described choice e g should i new
people attention each options
however when same decision was described e g should i new
people focused their attention single option was explicitly
thus preference was when description made single option more
effects various ways information found were more number percent than number percent because information about was but not latter
found there was effect risky choice individuals only focus second decision
recently reported similar effect choice
people also tend make spatial judgments result only most aspects spatial stimuli other
example found use only when making judgments
even found similar results
asked area found either other relevant dimension
found people often use direct distance between distance judgment little
recent study direct distance bias was even able found real situation information was presented using graphs
higher were often perceived
since people often focus most aspects spatial judgments tend focus attention choice above bias would also appear decision making problems presented graphs if options
order see problem number number same information provided each but information spatial representation function scale each graphs
time relatively number whereas money amount relatively number
you applied
two types b were presented graphs involving two attributes money time
you would if you could less time but more money
basis following data preference number point scale number not at all number each type
evaluation two types would affected scale graphs since people tend focus
specifically preference type would higher participants who number than those who number but would true type b
