paper particular distribution i e same important
three studies demonstrate individuals more less e g unknown number compared more e g not known number when
moreover effect regret less regret when less thus increasing
introduction
our gamble
some like
others like more
either chosen gamble outcome
would one gamble another would rather what simply because
example you
you then number another distribution
what would you do
rational since number more than
but would you
would decision different if was not
effect literature would predict people would not due loss up object
however between should not loss indeed most people would example one one one when small do so
contrast people generally distribution i e even when do so
according regret people
understanding important since many our choices represented new choosing
example one quality nature experience
people chosen gamble let would they them they would when other
paper potential their
specifically i propose more more about out gamble turn greater regret when
when gamble e g one likely greater regret gamble gamble e g result
result greater regret likelihood
example when among being close when still at increases making regret more turn likelihood one gamble i e another even when e g
paper specific type
proposed less about potentially make
result less less regret thus
reduced regret leads turn increased less
next section literature effect regret
then i present three studies test effect amount nature study number studies number number using two types two
study number tests role regret when effect them
