decision often options known probabilities options unknown probabilities
example phenomenon
generally been studied domain risky choice many theories aversion only context
however aversion may occur other
present experiment examine effects choice
subjects they must choose between two options
some times exact
others possible over range
problem was
subjects showed same pattern responses each when was option
aversion not specific risk but also occur other domains
introduction
when decision first question what will if i do
will make money
if i treatment will i better
not questions
thus second question probabilities what will make money
if i treatment what probability i will better
often questions cannot any degree either
while make good estimates probabilities various outcomes at other times must make decisions under decisions lack knowledge required subjective estimate probability
many decisions
apply expected utility theory theory risky choice situations decision must produce subjective estimate probabilities whether they they sufficient information do so
according expected utility theory decision should evaluate gamble probability each outcome numerical measure outcome utility
resulting numbers expected utility gamble decision should choose gamble value higher
because derived because no other system will result better outcomes over time considered theory decision making
was assumed addition being also described actual decisions
however theory choice
one was made who proposed what now known according decision should choose same outcome both gamble pairs
do would principle states outcome common two should not change decision preference between them
if decision gamble gamble pair one decision there more than
however if there more than there must more total than total decision should gamble gamble pair two well
decision who gamble pair two should gamble pair one
common outcome number if should not change whether
however found decision gamble first pair but gamble second pair
pattern choices principle thus
instead decision shows pattern choices each pair gamble known number unknown number
experiments both about pattern choices shown about aversion more generally
discussed terms risky choice work generally lead defined unknown probability probability decision does not information make subjective estimate
however seems possible aversion may more general phenomenon not risky choice
specifically may occur choice choices made about outcomes occur at different times
wide variety decisions described choices including decisions health behaviors
example must choose between small amount money now money larger amount money later
many cases length time will before outcome cannot estimated any degree accuracy probabilities risky choice
present experiment whether effects domain delay similar effects risky choice
