using decision shown two people's risk when group size
both positive negative people tend take greater decisions group size smaller greater when than
second often leads effect small group number number people
their results could new effect group size people's risk choice
however results usually observed experiments samples
study examine validity results through different ways different sample base
first was both selected sample general experiment sample but not second
introduction
over three empirical research human decision-making behavior shown bias number decision-making
one studies field was performed effects decision problems
their study subjects were presented number people were disease only two available
specifically outcome while b probabilistic outcome
outcome patients i e number while probabilistic outcome results probability all patients will probability no one will
after subjects they were asked choose one two
effect demonstrated follows when problem was represented terms positive most subjects number percent were certain number was more than risky choice there was only all number
contrast when problem was represented terms negative most subjects number percent risky choice number people was less than probability number could
number studies been test original study
one hand standard strong effects been not only different but also various applied
other hand some studies shown little no effect when context was
effect both context problem described various cognitive social variables
support cognitive social series studies observed effect group size people's risk detailed next section
however effect was usually experiments
thus examine validity group size effect whether effect different method different sample types
section number will explain effect group size
number number report results two experiments validity above effect
section number results
