introduction
number following review drug not used under number years because potentially effects occur
states drug number
since studies shown people little risk important evaluate
indeed despite wide recent found only number percent under number number percent who were family health number
decision-making literature suggests people information about effects into their decisions
when information about event description people tend event their decisions
other words people if event more likely occur than its objective probability
when people learn their own they tend events if event less likely occur than its objective probability
two different decisions result same information depending upon how one about potential choices their probabilities
recent literature focused mechanisms underlying between description decisions their relative importance
mechanisms include number when events past memory decisions will rely small set past outcomes number statistical sample bias events more often than due distribution number judgment bias people estimate likelihood even sample
practice people gain information both experience
whether given people who previously used agent subject potentially past experience
others little no experience agent more upon
research shown behavior people who had agent they their agent despite new information about associated
examine behavior applied agent clear health policy
who more experience use under number those without were able test following hypothesis behavioral due experience would reduce
even if appropriate its target may still not know what if perceived interest
example decisions not against despite lack about
thus order effect experience also measured source information
explore hypothesis would exhibit well examine other factors potentially amount relevant information effects frequency
our knowledge first study evaluate effect experience
basis our findings propose strategy increasing
