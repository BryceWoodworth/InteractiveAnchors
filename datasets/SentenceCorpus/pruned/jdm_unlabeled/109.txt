discuss our results cognitive processes underlying different response preferences
introduction
both been understanding how people make decisions under uncertainty how they
however whereas latter been more conditions under decisions rational focused cognitive processes underlying decisions preferences
early study showed people more attention probabilities payoffs depending response presented task
instance when asked simple gamble probability p amount individuals more likely base their judgment gamble payoff
however when people asked make choice between two more they more likely base decision probability p positive outcome
research demonstrated both particular set possible people's preferences simply them choose among set each them
each pair one gamble large payoff but low probability another gamble small payoff but high probability
way was possible dimension was more each task determine whether their effects people's preferences were preference
consistent above results showed many people because but then higher larger amount money
research preference suggests phenomenon condition when gamble larger payoff compared
result been many times no because particular theories choice assume stable preferences
several been suggested account preference like effect most
effects between task response been shown several research domains cognitive
suggested similar account different degree attention given specific attributes depending method used preferences
particular authors when attributes response scale they greater weight because they most response
instance when subjects asked set gamble task information about gamble payoff also expressed values e g
when task requires choice payoff information not response some its
fact could show using outcomes preference when no between task outcome was possible
assumption effect response specific characteristics options e g payoffs attention them
characteristics turn increases weight given them preferences
research processes underlying choices preference role attention effect
using system were able subjects view components each gamble one at time
results showed time at payoffs was significantly greater task than task therefore hypothesis people information depending answer they required provide
process used them improve understanding processes effect
required less time than
task information search pattern was significantly more than task between two outcomes two probabilities within same gamble between payoff its probability
finally there were differences how people generated their two tasks
when subjects one third time their evaluation response scale whereas task they same amount time generate response but position scale less often
based work recent application physiological measures study decision-making understanding effect people's information processing way
several study information processing physiological perspective recently useful investigate how people make decisions including event related
physiological measures also been applied investigate systems
instance using responses was shown processes than i e processes decisions based experience
furthermore used analyze people's information processing when
although their findings decision may not result different information processing was related higher number more complete information search more information
current paper physiological measures allow natural information while results information processing underlying effect
specifically our goal show number effects also present when using simple both gain loss number between effect process theories
different processes task characteristics alternative could their effect leading decision rely either more more strategies
particular setting seems more initial evaluation
dynamic could at type processing search most between amount possible gain
processing mean strategy characterized detailed evaluation specific gamble
contrast strategy based more general less detailed less evaluation gamble
therefore test hypothesis task requires more information processing process comparison between different information
consistent fact also used measure reactions should more strategy
other hand should based effort setting correct
thus people more cognitive effort when they asked set rather than rate
measure cognitive effort will use overall how many times subjects at information about outcomes their associated probabilities
hypothesis number subjects should more cognitive effort terms when than when since task should more strategy than task
hypothesis number b subjects should give payoff information more weight than probabilities when than when
other words subjects should more often than probabilities when than when
also find set additional results based type alternatives simple our study
instance subjects should more cognitive effort when amount increases comparison increase amount
consistent research effects gain loss cognitive processes demonstrated people exhibit more more cognitive analysis when potential losses
research loss aversion shows losses larger than gains typically more weight decisions
subjects should more loss than gain whose less
hypothesis also consistent previous literature bias
et al adaptive individuals their attention negative information
losses people reactions than gains therefore them more attention evaluate them more
previous work processes
hypothesis number subjects should more cognitive effort terms outcome negative
addition different cognitive processes gains losses also examine alternatives outcomes alternatives outcomes
previous research demonstrated outcomes special people's
described what they called effect individuals outcomes compared ones
evidence people should process alternatives outcomes alternatives outcomes
particular subjects should exhibit more processing characteristics e g more information when presented outcome rather than one since uncertainty should make more difficult specific value gamble
alternatives whose outcomes should more less effort than alternatives whose outcomes very but not
subjects should exhibit more processing characteristics when they evaluate alternative whose outcomes almost because uncertainty makes its value
therefore current study will provide additional evidence about processes effect findings lower end probability scale
hypothesis number more information should terms overall when subjects evaluate alternatives outcomes e g number percent either gain rather than alternatives outcomes number percent because uncertainty should making overall value more difficult
hypothesis number b evaluation alternatives outcome number percent should subjects less information terms overall than evaluation alternatives outcomes almost e g number percent either gain
finally effects different tasks cognitive effort mechanisms also find evidence effect behavioral data i e evaluation
demonstrated prior research should more changes outcome value i e when form
should more changes outcome i e when form
cognitive processes different tasks i e versus different types outcomes versus should also affect how alternatives
if people more payoffs then they should less difference between outcomes since less attention processing probabilities
however sensitivity difference between outcomes should not task since case people do not more payoffs than probabilities
therefore find difference between outcomes when subjects asked rate their whereas no difference should when subjects asked set
derive hypothesis directly effect
since response effect information more highly people's difference between alternatives outcomes should depend method used preferences
instance even when very close e g number percent number percent number percent number percent difference between uncertainty still make difference way people alternatives
because effect difference should more relevant when subjects provide rather than when they
people should provide higher number percent gain compared number percent gain number percent gain compared number percent gain
subjects should provide higher number percent loss compared number percent loss number percent loss compared number percent loss
however subjects should set similar number percent number percent alternatives also number percent number percent ones
hypothesis number according effect more outcomes when
hypothesis number b since should people outcomes alternatives outcomes will when people asked rate but not when they asked set
main goal study apply effect well analysis effect theories decision making
further subjects should more cognitive effort increasing losses hypothesis number
people should also more information when alternatives outcomes number percent rather than alternatives outcomes number percent hypothesis number
they should less information when alternatives outcomes number percent rather than alternatives almost outcomes number percent hypothesis number b
