most current theories moral judgment predict either no effect combined context will lead greater focus
contrast similarity effect choice may become less combined choice context
introduction
moral judgments often decision making choice
latter involves often may not strategy moral situations
now problem over people
if will another but person
version only way large person
most people but person patterns so consistent some they universal
person often described example decision making where focus intrinsic actions per rather than outcomes
between scenarios been used effective theories moral judgment
one popular effect between means effect
means when uses body single larger number people considered
effect however when single after considered
other relevant between direct versus object
number other studies other factors associated action spatial distance physical contact between temporal order events et al number further our understanding role properties moral choice
although most research problems focused factors associated others at role utility outcomes
example more than relative but person more than
more than
additional sensitivity outcomes when number at increases increases too
finally been shown experimental question
positive attention number leads greater action than negative number result
our study context effects based two scenarios into one where person do
standard case leads one number associated
current moral theories typically do not make predictions about extended context though most suggest combined increase attention outcomes
example proposed version two one there person other
under condition single person
our study however both action outcomes way no choice any other choice
specifically one our combined could large person one person but where two people will do case people
person less than all but two people less than one
if combined choice context increases attention outcomes then analysis action should more because there option available leading
same one person should if become relatively more
action may seen always so would not affected context
data combined predictions
particular presence option less person even when more
us consider different form choice context effect similarity effect
know no theory moral judgment predicts similarity effects
what follows first describe similarity effects related context effects then turn study at choice context effects
choice context effects
number class choice context effects
number end moral when results binary moral shows development choice theory
how much like number models
one way them how much they given model
method reference point person so many cases will not very
another way choices simply use binary where choose more all possible
choices into some preference metric will us relative each compared
further since scale will assume even rely information where if do not data direct comparison between c still what people will choose based other two
early model choice behavior were new findings range
depending particular choice set addition new option been found change preferences
several context effects been identified present focus similarity effects
addition consider context effect associated versus evaluation hypothesis
similarity
number class similarity
number end choose between focus all about
better but focus having lower
further our number number between two options
early work rational choice theory when additional options become available new options might well choices but theories did assume relative preference between initial set focus our example would same
many empirical studies however people often principle
similarity effect option close one alternatives increase relative its
example if choice set than but better who was previously about focus options typically focus over
could more choices than focus
see number choice set rather than assume more similar focus being better but more
now relative choice between focus should towards more focus than
choice context effects similarity effect
addition similarity effect two other types context effect potentially relevant current work
first effect third option results one first two being seen leads increase choices option
example if third option example much better than but also significantly more then will become studies show being often increases preferences
less efficient option versus focus choice set may make focus lead being
how might effects work our
our example people but leading two people versus
option one person could make between more versus all actions leading any
leads notion option may make more
context effect will work versus evaluation
you value two one very good condition number number words other condition but number number words
found smaller higher than larger one when each evaluation but smaller lower than larger one evaluation
according hypothesis number words not very information evaluation because there no reference point comparison
result number words more important dimension rather than evaluation
same way our where leads two people but being may direction outcome utility when option single person
would lead option less
moral choices context effects
our initial was choices would based
but also considered options rules might not context effects
example option three might seen positive itself but its value when there option available would four
but like person may even when less options
problems choice set having two one value utility number people other value cost intrinsic actions themselves including
latter dimension useful basic difference between versus person when outcomes same
addition his shown when outcomes at people often choose do bias
example one would given choice between one person versus one person people will show strong preference do
observations dimension action leading context turn person
dimension less better
two set context effects
next section present empirical study preferences action different choice sets
key comparison between two same options but differ number
if two options differ function properties third option will demonstrate context effect may take form similarity effect effect effect
determine form choice context effect will compared scenarios
predictions different theories context effects after description design
