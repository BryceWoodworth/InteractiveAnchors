group decision-making multiple
important difficulty large number groups each multiple participants
groups online could make process also provide group more work groups than sample typically groups
main goal paper compare decisions online groups those groups
did so study gain loss risky decision between groups examined decisions both individual group groups
all dependent measures compared online sample
our results suggest interaction group decision-making research found no effects communication individual group decision outcome variables
effects were found suggest use online groups may method group research
among online groups were but generated greater number thought i e they made more efficient use time
introduction
group decision making more than individual decision making multiple
requires more complex data analysis methods due increase number levels analysis relevant variables
also requires increased sample sufficient statistical power test groups rather than individuals analysis
groups themselves sources further variation social interactions group between groups
all increases increases required sample size effects experimental
another practical group present at same time where single lead experimental
