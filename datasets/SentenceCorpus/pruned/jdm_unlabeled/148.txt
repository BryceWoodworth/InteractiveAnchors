recent study moral decision making et al
current study whether results using different different
number participants
another group number participants was tested control condition
levels responses were rate
all participants performed moral decision-making task moral
were either each option
participants compared control participants made judgments needed making decision
individual physiological response was related judgments
results those previously found although different were used
introduction
recent research moral decision making emotional responses cognitive processes
there also evidence decision making tasks moral decision making
given moral responses themselves seems investigate more how moral decisions different types
moral decision making studies moral problem
problem into
people whether where will only one person whereas other people being
only way people will but will person being
decision one person order group people called because overall all individuals involved
according several authors judgments particularly related cognitive processes whereas judgments particularly related emotional responses
most people judgment but not because perceived more high
because agent take direct action individual existing agent
response making decision differ respect choice participants typically need make judgment than judgment
results between emotional decisions not direct agent judgment overall
before moral responses
but then there also evidence simple decision making measured tasks task game task
task performance based emotional learning processes processing feedback gains losses previous trials strategy application most decisions
related decision making leads results long individual responses related decisions
recent study investigated moral decisions after well known task et al using measures
participants were either social test participants solve task control condition
they subset moral developed et al were either each decision alternative
et al found participants made judgments individual response was related number judgments
they cognitive control processes necessary making judgments
based theoretical empirical current study significant findings et al different i e different i e rate
both rate levels rate associated neural also system reactions associated
social test been shown both systems been shown system too
our study was results et al different methods
