representation might cue
cues were predictive disease participants had each who two patients was
both experiments cues but higher strategies alternative cues

introduction
making choices between objects people either preferences do i like more
will better

often multiple information about attributes probabilistic cues combined
decision researchers decision strategies processing cues either according rules like
strategies been proposed participants appear choose between them
structural similarity choice tasks both involve integration features cues
however models feature patterns basis inference rather than cue integration cue models
his models multiple cue judgment tasks found well
extended approach decisions cue values had memory rather than being presented i e during phase experiments participants only stimulus all their attributes had been learned had long term memory
their p did not find more decision making rather most participants
will test memory per does not decisions whereas difficulty cue combination memory does
