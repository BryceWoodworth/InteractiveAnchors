study choice experiment test loss aversion theory derived preferences subjective value reference point generally greater when loss than when change perceived gain
far known paper first use test loss aversion theory
highly testing because estimates attributes based reference point constant
moreover loss aversion examined each
another advantage applied attributes
event used empirical loss aversion theory tested within context preference structures attributes estimated using data number observations made sample number who had recently given
presented tested
overall significant support behavioral loss aversion theories was found
introduction
outcome choice often determined intrinsic utility outcome itself combined its contrast reference point
most preferences loss aversion subjective value change generally greater when reference point loss than when change perceived gain
most general theory model theory
loss aversion review practical theory out examples derived loss aversion hypothesis
recently presented extended model preferences loss aversion more generally
studies present evidence loss aversion hypothesis
they include et al et al et al et al
there also several studies at loss aversion domain
they include et al et al
what reference point used individual evaluate gains positive versus losses negative
empirical studies examined reference point was under
were other researchers reference point used his model assumed reference point rational recent past about outcomes
they rule point within framework model
et al influence reference point health domain
quantitative data they provided evidence reference point reference point
empirical study new different approach reference point testing loss aversion hypothesis
choice experiments used estimation preference structure good relative importance different attributes good under constant reference
follows also testing loss aversion hypothesis each
into components not people loss all attributes there most different loss aversion compared across attributes
far known first study test loss aversion derived preferences
empirical presented paper was among number who had recently given
their preferences attributes number information patients time were estimated loss aversion was tested each attributes
main results study were loss aversion hypothesis was four attributes investigated
results were less time
following section method estimation
third section model derived loss aversion theory
preference structures used test presented section number
