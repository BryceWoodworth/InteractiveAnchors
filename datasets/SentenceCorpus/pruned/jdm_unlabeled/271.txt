genetic number number early detection
one key feature genetic testing risk
however little attention been how risk information despite fact they base treatment family decisions information
study issue set out test ability choose most appropriate cancer about risk cancer number number genes
participants number who had not genetic testing had cancer number who had genetic testing had cancer
over number percent who had not genetic testing had cancer number percent those who had genetic testing had cancer information
furthermore body research found high level objective subjective associated ability
introduction
genetic number number gene mutations associated higher risk at early detection
one key feature genetic process risk risk specific disease during
indeed both patients genetic rate communication risk information part process
not who test positive number number often rely risk estimates make future family whether despite being cancer free
given importance risk information researchers been whether their risk cancer
others investigated relationship between risk perception emotional reaction well between risk perception whether genetic testing risk improve accuracy their risk cancer
although studies examined estimation their risk more fundamental issue how risk information
after all if risk whether they risk would less important
indeed research shown people numerical probabilities multiple ways
researchers demonstrated individuals there number percent different ways will number percent region number percent time number percent like
since people common probabilistic information probabilistic information like risk cancer even greater given emotional impact
knowledge however no previous studies examined how their risk cancer what variables e g might affect ability information
research shown ability understand basic mathematical important quality decisions
researchers long levels play key role decision making might influence way people understand risk
recent review idea well low choice risk communication outcome
while data strongly existence relationship between decision making whether levels affect ability risk data still question
research existing literature set out examine two related
first predicted about risk cancer would give various not all would correct
second predicted participants higher levels will better understanding risk information than their lower levels
