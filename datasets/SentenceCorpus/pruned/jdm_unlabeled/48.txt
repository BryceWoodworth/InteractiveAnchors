introduction
paper models how decisions made settings
study they out their
decision
their decisions them they cases every
decisions significant involving even
asked how many elements consider how complex their decision patterns
study actual cases decision-making about fast heuristics psychological models
there literature how decision when they rely multiple cues decision
many researchers decisions do not rely all information available any way
instead they rely simple heuristics turn out efficient more complex approaches rational analysis
paper model decisions made real life
how simple how complex judgments out
do consider all elements case
what extent do they all information available them
there at least two treatment available information
first cognitive
people do not use optimal approach because integration all information available their
all humans limited cognitive fundamental difficulty conditions under work
their high only few available case each characterized some parameters
strategy selection task
time specifically time available per variable been shown affect decision making resulting variables being considered complex cognitive strategies ones processing cases after experience
there therefore their decisions into some pattern
however second factor they do not feedback important
feedback decisions been shown essential good strategies
particular while interactions often decisions not case when decision feedback their decisions about outcome
even if what they they lack clear criterion evaluate quality their decision
little develop complex decision rules
yet they do not random judgments
instead accuracy they may judgment one they consider appropriate their about each case
yet even if criterion accuracy best possible decision every case
since their task each case must increase they do not much higher where
they may also use methods less well thought out than if were high information complete
