observed when participants were given way their actions payoffs they behavior
experiment together design alternative observed behavior findings
introduction
previous although individuals often they also thus situations where might expected required them
recent paper presented results experiment where participants were given choice either about effects their actions computer learn about how their decisions could affect another
despite mechanism participants their experiment actions
contrast when did not choice behavior was
based data argue observed many experiments may not due preference outcome but may result people give due factors while not corresponding outcome p number
indeed observed when between actions outcomes was behavior
given potential findings behavior role factors may play them here robustness results alternative experimental design
experiment subjects were asked make their actions
addition preference there alternative why subjects their experiments may chosen not
first subjects may perceived not
requires additional effort
may been because generated delay
experiment who payoffs learn about before being able own payoff
finally more possible bias may results
indeed one more experimental design where choice its option
paper way participants not information about control decision delay some bias
indeed our experiment not information about payoffs required same amount effort time both options required action
also experiment generate most environment test decisions
overall our results results data
