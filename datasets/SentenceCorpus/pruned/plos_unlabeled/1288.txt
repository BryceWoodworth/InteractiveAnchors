computational methods identify genome problem potentially transcription factor binding sites while knowledge specific interactions involved remains limited
without comparison their performance accuracy tools remains
large number different tools address problem them based search strategy input data
methods were chosen applied predict database across human regions
our results show optimal choice method depending species sequences question
when regions those methods evolutionary predictive power than methods designed single genome
different search strategies rely different properties different methods one another
example some clusters binding sites while others perform best short
furthermore most methods appear structure genome they applied
analyze features methods performed well identify leading performance provide
also propose key development evaluation future methods
introduction
regulation involves binding transcription factors dna
most cases multiple transcription factors control transcription single transcription site
limited transcription factors complex regulatory step through various spatial temporal interactions between themselves their binding sites
scale transcription factor binding interactions distinct rather than distributed
called
dna sequences others examples
appropriate transcription factors elements
generally few long few several transcription factors each transcription factors multiple binding sites
et al demonstrated sequence analysis
they genome clusters potential binding sites gene transcription factors known together early
they found more than third clusters binding sites early gene genes transcription factors
property many contain clusters similar transcription factor binding sites et al predicted over genomic regions genes interest transcription factors identified both known novel within gene network
recent study importance functions revealed how changes original elements affect its function
et al found elements gene appear similar seen thus mutations generate between species
later study they showed distinct regulatory elements same gene lead same change
et al investigated genetic protein expression
they functional difference case not only binding sites but also their
there also evidence within specific lead disease
one example given et al
any regulatory elements changes its expression level brain human
