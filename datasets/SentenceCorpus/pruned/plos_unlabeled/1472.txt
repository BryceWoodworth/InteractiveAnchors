introduction
cell yet lead activation pathway b mechanism cell signals
mechanism involves sequence biochemical changes resulting cellular its
physiological process cell development cancer cells
contrast results membrane
long seen cell also involved cancer cells
regulatory network cell pathways could help identify how under conditions cell between different types cellular
moreover could suggest ways when yet cells
decision process involves several pathways well multiple positive negative regulatory
mathematical provides approach understand complex systems
models cell control usually focus one pathway only intrinsic pathways
few studies both pathways some show concentration specific components decision between while other studies investigate between specific cell types along role key components pathways but no mathematical models including available yet
moreover still lack models how cellular conditions determine choice between how what extent between
our study at cell decision process
three main considered cell
although pathways leading three highly first describe them include each pathway
description does not but rather at most processes cell decision
only pathway considered here
upon their presence specific complex
leads activation
type cells intrinsic pathway also dna directly through events
protein then membrane
there family interaction proteins
results membrane factors
c
presence complex activation activation
specific targets major biochemical changes
during where able
also positive activation
type i cells directly
