based hypothesis during evolution genes likely manner
presence genes now common way associated genes
approach means functional between two genes critical step why previous work area focused using presence species
here demonstrate genomes high whose distributions presence information
feature makes them standard prediction methods
using structural domain database complete genomes developed novel method uses genome number each domain predict functional relationships
our approach at levels sequence percent percent at each level
all compared using identify those correlated changes their domain number
demonstrate two protein will strong signals when their compared at similarity levels their functional relationship
our method functional relationships not presence does not require any fixed define genes
introduction
comparison proteins different species method related proteins
approach two related proteins will been through
therefore correlated presence patterns different genomes possible protein functional relationship
after original idea was method was many different ways
through application more complex rules compare protein use domain instead whole proteins algorithm integration species information
although method new sources information all cases prediction quality method depends two critical selection reference species sample proteins
typically latter using best approach similarity determined algorithm potential
fact two different prediction quality
reference species problem simply increasing sample size new genomes certain number been
however there many problems especially
exist within one genome also exhibit functional between
fact genes at different rates due both natural selection their functions different species having different mutation rates point mutations more than evolutionary rates proteins may over several different gene
rate variation makes difficult choose single similarity applied identify those most likely similar
family problem particularly genomes genes present multiple much higher than genomes
however higher not only problem makes more difficult relationships species
contrast accurate identification noise domain more complex gene higher presence regions
furthermore there correlation between number complexity
due number most significantly greater use regulatory mechanisms
developed novel method several problems especially functional also perceived detection problem
method particularly functional networks so far
our approach based protein domains since most protein function
furthermore allows us domain
study used domain database complete genomes
first key do not consider presence domains but number domain
second key all domains at levels sequence percent percent
then every domain family within identification distinct functional within domain
although clear there always any evolutionary model proposed hypothesis our model gene number two related protein clusters will related
our approach domain at many levels therefore expected two protein clusters will significant correlation signal when their compared at similarity levels their functional relationship
therefore domain were compared all against all identify domain number variation all different levels
our method found strong signals related domain could not been predicted presence comparison proposed et al
new approach number features make especially useful genome analysis
based protein domains functional relationships not using whole proteins noise protein domain produce particularly
uses domain instead presence
latter less effective genomes they do not account wide variation gene number observed
method applied does not require any fixed define groups
because domain clusters at several levels method into account much variation selection sequence functional
