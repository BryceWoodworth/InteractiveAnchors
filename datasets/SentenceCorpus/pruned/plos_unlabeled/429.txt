introduction
early identification effects highly efficient since drug effects all drug drug development
rely against large number
computational approaches could not only time during potential but also provide into understanding molecular mechanisms protein drug interactions
been shown potential identified structure activity relationship small molecules
however methods strongly depends structures used training few them directly take target structure into account
although protein interactions studies at level understanding molecular mechanism effects protein large scale structural human lack practical estimate binding
here approach problem different direction proteins similar binding sites likely similar
study test predicting potential binding sites receptor
several receptor been developed other
however associated effects
identify molecular mechanisms their effects similar binding sites across functional space using known binding site
search used robust functional site prediction comparison algorithm developed recently our
similar site protein
prediction further detailed protein potential analysis
our prediction well biochemical observations molecular into effect
strategy used case study could applied other available existing different
process could also drug discovery development effort drug leads reduce effects
