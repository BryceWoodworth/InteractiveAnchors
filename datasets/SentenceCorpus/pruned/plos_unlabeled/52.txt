introduction
genomic major underlying cancer
include various types mutations number
involves regions either more than two one cell
genes regions natural while those regions potential genes
thus cell samples central aim cancer research
recent years variety been developed identify genomic
studies using typically analyze data produce estimates total number across genome
however studies individual number each
thus example if region question being generally remains
interest because may been selected because its effect
data also been identify events
studies typically where there sample at same site at normal sample
issue may due one rather than other thus may not fact present
number analysis detection both number data
paper present procedure numbers single data
our algorithm highly accurate at over sites
also able numbers across genome making use fact constant each
our results also allow made between true due only one
cancer samples almost genomic dna result other cell
previously been literature single gene level known while their
our knowledge phenomenon not previously been described scale though proposed mechanisms would suggest expected result
addition our identify being
could mutations via
indeed presence makes studies
