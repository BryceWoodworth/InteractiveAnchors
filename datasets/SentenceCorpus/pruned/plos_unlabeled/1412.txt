introduction

central idea minimum potential energy system
network model each network identified amino each provides linear structure
dynamics therefore expressed terms normal system about its information about protein values defined network
few methods used but most at their two underlying all at their distance between nodes among other variables
models network model were taken all nodes distance less than distance greater
models were proposed power distance where interactions residues
although lead between predictions certain experimental data there still no clear best method
common approach performance their been compare corresponding observed between models
because often focus study been
indeed been shown well those predicted detailed experimentally determined dynamics
however information information been during results experimental data
further complex dynamics structures global when only considered
predicted relatively lower confidence but may important while its global
finally while studies shown network factor especially those low frequency there may other structural properties not but may provide more description dynamics if
here examine structural models determined proteins evaluate each their mean values
present technique within network so provide most accurate representation experimentally observed data
our method based concept entropy when form unknown probability distribution one least form data entropy subject constraints available data
method been applied variety biological problems including neural networks gene interaction networks protein
resulting used model optimal
shown when constraints maximization pair probability distribution form
further only terms probability distribution those pairs explicitly considered constraints entropy maximization
terms means given network there exists unique set experimentally observed between all pairs residues along their
our technique physical factors sequence spatial distance been found influence constant
sequence expressed terms contact order number residues along sequence between two residues
further our analysis against test set proteins suggests additional factors including formation secondary structure type should also more accurate description experimental data
also factors little dynamics conditions
amino out one distributions obtained different types amino
version factors proposed perform better than existing models especially
finally study importance higher role protein dynamics discussed model development protein design
