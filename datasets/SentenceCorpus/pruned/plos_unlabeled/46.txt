other signal
physiological conditions exists associated domain either protein
studies revealed different may present not clear whether one both relevant under physiological conditions
recently structure domain associated between available
study complete t structure model based structure complex
structure was using energy
normal analysis was investigate complex structure model two known structures
significant among domains four were observed while part complex together
normal analysis revealed two frequency were involved conformational changes leading two structures
first normal account more than percent conformational changes both cases
evidence further idea model
model used study
introduction
at
reaction very fast limit
three different molecular due at
only form expressed brain normal
t associated either protein
structural protein t synaptic membrane protein t membrane brain
they both contain domain site
three residues been shown could its t
t required its
sequence highly conserved at position series residues including four
because domain been domain
t
recently structure complex was at
complex expected
four single itself
each all four them form
makes interactions
four related
interaction very no range
remains unknown how four associated
studies revealed two distinct structures
both structures show there no all four
one structure two close all four sequences same direction other structure space between two large four sequences
were should both although were seen was not possible them
was suggested might related regulation
test were using two structures structure
results showed rate per active site was reduced due active site compared form but could
rate reduction due active site was particularly
structure two structures were not very
problem was both structures four seen complex structure
since four structure without complex structures complex along between pairs
fact complex structure at about
between limited contact between two assume interaction over interaction
fact only exists if sequence
previous study interaction was identified interaction compared strong interaction seen between
also been shown if two proteins example both sequences at their at various three one protein one other
points t complex form physiological conditions
since two structures were generated experimentally they physiological model through conformational changes
study t complex model following interaction
although molecular dynamics useful dynamics conformational changes size system too much case
normal analysis uses representation protein reduce computational cost been shown useful predicting seen large protein example motion etc often related conformational changes required biological functions protein
here applied t complex model normal
conformational changes normal was found two structures could using normal
