introduction
become central understanding disease control strategies
one control method contact been considered large number disease
include control
particular allows control at cost effort finding individuals at risk
since contact place process over network interactions between natural consider models process
theoretical work so far contact process through simulation
work means numbers contact well
case clustering due existence short contact network generally been more difficult make similar
existing theoretical work therefore either been case populations all clustering due simulation networks
work derive models two significant problems existing use make impact clustering contact other network parameters constant appropriate
find many parameter choices there out increased impact contact clustering increases
not however general result full clustering contact should subject case case
perform our analysis within while some our will general all disease other will towards where does not
