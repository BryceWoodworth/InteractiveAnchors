then expected mutations at rate
lead genes into complete functional proteins also expected after their formation occurs

not only identification but also overall identification classification independent gene within regions several not detailed analysis particular region human 2
previous global analyses gene focused appear far more than
define context identification several genomes
estimated number regions significantly within between per genome
however basis our recent more detailed analysis human 2 estimate human genome might actually contain no more than because previous sets were
addition several also been identified during single human detailed studies focused particular gene genomic regions
despite all human likely complex regions multiple genes
