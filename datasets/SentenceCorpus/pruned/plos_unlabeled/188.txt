introduction
later his work gene functional now seen general mechanism new functions
also regulatory networks thought significantly genetic
instance sequence analysis transcription factor points various events
however very little known about pathways about corresponding changes subject selection
while not yet been experimentally related aspects been
however central pathways through computer simulations remains unknown relation between sequence binding general rather assumed
describe formation new regulatory interaction after event our current aim approach would particularly
here many characteristics adaptation real hidden body data been over many years
measured values used pathways single base pair selection
here develop approach study their binding sites
more specifically focus new unique recognition two two
consider conditions evolution independent regulation
regulatory process where must
presence not sufficient condition achieve new function
rather evolutionary potential seen actual evolutionary search within
intrinsic overall aim work
many open questions when formation new interaction may new matching key
instance how should protein new site also does not yet exist
one would mutations need occur protein site
does mean losses must when taking
how many mutations must before new recognition obtained selection
latter important mutations advantage more through population resulting increase probability
questions optimal pathways well population dynamics simulations
previously been shown indeed exist
our simulations pair achieve binding while increasing its process
moreover simply following does system global features
detailed analysis network changes sequence events study underlying mechanisms applied
next show find optimal pathway simulations not since similar using probabilistic mutation
results further suggest regulatory evolution experiments finally make comparison alternative models new regulatory interactions
