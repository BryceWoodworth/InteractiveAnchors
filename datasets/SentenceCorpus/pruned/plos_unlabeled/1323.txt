introduction
disease practice
individuals same disease at our current often show variation treatment because similar disease state genetic environmental factors
focused increasing quantitative information including protein expression data better based specific biological pathways
using samples now expression into
however complex human multiple systems analysis levels samples way obtain quantitative information patients disease classification
data analysis may techniques applied other data types
data integration network information interaction data pathways underlying processes development robust accurate disease
human disease should changes context known metabolic reactions
use data derived tests individuals normal
first significant between observed changes metabolic pathways
next applied pathway analysis changes recent human metabolic network use recently developed previous approaches derived expression analysis find active metabolic highly
while approach little resulting pathway models between propose role

given multiple human metabolic may disease classification disease
