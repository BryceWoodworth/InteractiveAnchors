see what effects noise relatively small activity recently examined response system noise mean applied current firing
article more model spatial extent
system component input current small whereas stochastic component over region may may not component
mean values below above critical values effects noise increasing simulation
point model small noise critical value activity leads minimum noise level increases
was case both noise noise
noise along whole only more effective cell than noise occurs region
fact found if signal noise spatial extent then noise may
if however signal noise applied then noise no effect activity no how large its region application though noise
effects could not point model important real behavior
does occur when noise larger even when noise signal do not being due secondary rather than system one another
introduction
almost found many central system including example cells neurons neurons neurons neurons
behavior also found activity populations
since component activity at all levels interest see what effects noise may activity neurons
there many model could used being provided classes type 1 type 2 neurons
chosen first examine behavior type 2 neural model its full spatial version been recent studies
methods use extended more models
spatial system membrane three one most mathematical models
corresponding system been subject very large number studies analyses example
most modeling studies some use spatial extent many those include spatial extent do not include because all three major components makes system conditions
recent study used stochastic model demonstrated effect noise there were optimal at nodes most efficient signal transmission
if solutions statistical properties found simulation stochastic models including model not much more than corresponding point models although more time required
other hand spatial models more parameters must many at best only estimated
original action potential formation only distribution corresponding was assumed
current various did not distance
however there two why basic model been modeling more complex cells
do depend position neurons especially those central system often many synaptic many different sources each source different spatial distribution pattern
thus spatial models cells also used same components current but over
most central neurons many each many times
article focus model one space dimension most accurate usually
thus first instance our approach useful investigate properties single
simple used gain some into properties neurons complex methods structure thus problem one space dimension
thus models neurons
recent studies stochastic input revealed new stochastic
latter there noise level at some response variable maximum
particular system at mean input current critical value firing was found small amount noise could strongly
furthermore there given mean current minimum firing rate noise level increased
properties related firing found single neurons input current networks neurons
interest see if spatial where addition many spatial distribution mean input noise
will demonstrate spatial system similar but more complex behavior than system
