transcription factor regulation often
mutations independent expression level expression analysis
using propose new algorithm gene mutation data
mutation growth protein
compared less find not expressed at any time points
despite algorithm through integration three sources expression
novel question most most expressed genes
correct answer
our new approach regulatory changes network dynamics
procedure regulatory relative relevant part network
contrast other methods compare networks testing not used
introduction
evolution normal development responses processes cancer all involve at least some regulatory
indeed differences makes each individual unique
key nodes regulatory transcription factors
thus there interest methods changes
interactions but requires large
furthermore does not so biological complex
likely sites key regulatory mutations revealed whole genome but approach requires large numbers individuals very
even so exact gene may if there several genes
any case little into underlying regulatory mechanisms
order gain further into regulatory computational approaches being proposed
they all information multiple levels biological particularly interaction binding site data
regulatory change through gene expression data been because tend expressed at levels close sensitivity standard expression
further activation often expression level
important common activation processes expression analysis
network approach might utility while might not between two systems its new position network system might allow detection
allow evaluation hypothesis experimental model system required
because they genomic dna mutation
resulting protein growth importance pathways
analysis expression versus found was not using expression
thus system know gene mutation but cannot identify samples
across time points our aim was question answer
other words what question do need gene expression data mutation
