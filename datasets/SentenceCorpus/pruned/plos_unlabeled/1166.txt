protein interaction networks typically been using yeast techniques
generally direct binary interactions while method however latter technique known number effects including
describe novel approach two proteins data set us level interaction corresponding distribution interaction
find two recent data sets yeast contain specific associations compared random direct physical interactions two data high
our interaction data sets generally more than those previous studies when compared against four reference sets
furthermore find our data sets more direct physical associations than sets
protein interaction network derived data revealed highly show not result associations direct interactions
fact propose data sets may they contain associations significantly
also found contain significant however previous study interaction data show thus more interaction detection methods
our yeast data sets further biological discovery our system will prove useful other data sets
introduction
into mechanisms cellular processes obtained protein interaction networks describe physical associations between component proteins
many types biological discovery including protein function prediction inference disease genes identification response
yeast been model system studies been determined using number including yeast
each approach interactions distinct manner
techniques direct binary interactions although approach does not rely upon expression gene required while techniques identify protein
each technique been literature analyses
however generally any measure not dependent nature standard reference set
additional complexity analysis data set because there no standard system between direct interactions present complex
only information available individual its protein associated proteins
furthermore proteins identified complex methods different often
another protein proteins having higher more likely more therefore involved more interactions after all pairs
address number approaches analysis data sets been
techniques common goal protein pairs relative some random
while each method likelihood two proteins together using different et al observed relative expected et al combination machine learning algorithms et al algorithm derived bayesian methods parameters et al determine interaction probabilities based distributions
generated been found data sets interactions
were generally direct against information protein sequences
recent study data sets distributions functional interactions interactions order extent latter formation functional protein
was overall impact upon biochemical had limit
use techniques measure network motifs connectivity complex networks developed approach levels interaction data sets
system allows protein comparing experimentally observed numbers those
two proteins provides statistical measure their data set
approach requires no training set machine learning therefore any data set any species whether any information exists not
found data sets contain significant specific associations
showed direct physical interactions two data significantly high
therefore while data sets contain associations our analysis there underlying preference proteins form associations
our interaction data sets were further against four reference data sets each unique manner interaction detection mechanism
most found our interaction sets were higher than those previous studies
our data sets only ones typically experimental interaction sets
data et al was revealed free effects while those derived data et al biases
therefore would appear data sets interaction not protein
note recently been found true interaction data sets
derived data et al was shown highly many regions different random network
also demonstrated observed high not result associations direct rather result direct physical associations
furthermore suggest interaction data sets may associations significantly physical interactions they likely
shows proteins having similar numbers total interactions each other
proteins each other rather than proteins having very small numbers total interactions
previous study find shows while set physical binary interactions both measure
therefore data appear while interaction data appear
our yeast data sets further involving biological discovery our procedure will prove useful analysis current future data sets variety species
compared our interaction data sets those perceived number novel their network properties
their must their different methods interaction detection
