introduction
recent techniques allow measurements interest at high spatial temporal
example allows observation individual action up tree
techniques allow synaptic events individual
data very detailed models single cells
both parameter space nature observed data use statistical techniques
here here use sequential methods standard approach hidden systems estimation data
first step will do while detailed second step models cellular
given nature detailed cellular models hand there long been strong robust methods
need methods
example provides integration number standard simulation large number search uses combination wide variety cost functions measure quality data
however highly complex approaches while make optimal use structure present statistical problem new data techniques
past been shown us others knowledge true number fundamental parameters estimation spatial distribution multiple synaptic input
inference problem form linear regression single global all parameters given data
approaches however at present take various noise sources situations explicitly into account
here findings standard inference statistical situations more specifically approach will provide more robust solutions probabilistic approach will allow noise manner
specifically approach issue observations data first then setting
how accurate description cell used optimal variables 2 concentration
then show how accurate model cell signals first using first step standard machine learning algorithm known
step here out version our previous inference method assumed exact knowledge signals
aim paper detailed models data
first give models parameters those models how inference affected noise how standard machine learning techniques applied inference problem
will terms measurements but later also consider measurements
