predicting protein function structure remains active area interest particularly structural where number structures little no functional
although global structure comparison methods used functional relationship between function complex particularly through different secondary structure common structural core
prediction algorithms local known predicted functional residues
here present novel method structural motifs associated different functional within domain
basis their given method makes no prior prediction functional sites specific properties residues
able between domains different functions popular structure comparison methods leading function prediction method
large data set all three major protein classes demonstrate functional motifs
also provide novel predictions activity large number structures protein structure
overall show able similar protein domain structures using patterns structural all residues
introduction
prediction protein function structure become increasing interest significant structures structural lack functional
furthermore approaches particular interest predicting binding sites sites protein development
many current methods focus functional residues then whole structures
problems taking approach what functional increasing number available protein structures being
site hand residues directly involved whereas generate based active site residues defined authors
although whether sufficient when required
address problem all protein structures there number methods aim do
example method structure into then against set structures using search algorithm
according sequence similarity local environment
method uses genetic algorithm construct based their ability between different protein against database
graph theoretical approach structural patterns associated given family proteins binding motifs
provide structures through multiple structure alignment
recent evolutionary method binding site prediction was used structural based predicted functional residues
matching properties residues binding site
well other approaches compare properties binding sites often active sites
one complexity using structures between binding state protein example structures transition states
matching active site region due conformational changes occur binding
address issue methods above use variety approaches graph matching various levels
method alternative approach using potential given set c account both local global relationships between residues across protein structure
recent site comparison analysis was able between very different protein binding range
despite many methods present literature very few available general
hence first step function structure often use global structure comparison methods evolutionary relationships even where sequence similarity
methods been specifically applied function prediction confidence values when terms between related structures
however very remains structure comparison methods generally give measure structural distance at one two proteins perform related functions results many relationships
analyses shown although function structure well conserved there significant number highly where not case
moreover latter represented both genomes tend exhibit wide range core biological functions across large range species
analysis et al showed within tend common evolutionary core but core different secondary structure elements often changes function
however although structural might change some function others found still other aspects common
therefore global measure structural similarity distance between two proteins less than structural motifs relevant given function
algorithm presented here was designed derive structural functional within
first global structure alignment across structural patterns associated each based patterns
new functional then using global structural each but only similarity over identified
approach very well between different functions compared global methods another approach
although here method
test generated large data set domains
our data set allows us at variation results between importance using large test data set methods
against give how comparison other standard methods function prediction
also present some examples structural motifs identified explain their functional
finally use make novel predictions function proteins protein structure
