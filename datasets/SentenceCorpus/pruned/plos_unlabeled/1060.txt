contrast other approaches current model contains integration uses feedback effective time scales processing at each response changes input stimulus
model features common process suggests key role central temporal dynamics processing
introduction
neural processing essential understanding
one most important features perception usually associated
hence number models perception based upon temporal analysis neural activity stimulus
most models form activity using integration time
models been able predict reported wide range complex stimuli
however choosing appropriate integration time been previous models been able explain wide range time scales data
data show certain conditions system information over time scales several while at same time being able changes only few
temporal perception also been detection performance function frequency rate main being system limited ability process
between temporal integration not perception but general temporal processing
instance long integration time several required explain way perceived increases increasing
contrast much integration times necessary explain fact system events only few
therefore integration time processing stimulus task
previously was proposed integration processing different integration times
more recently order data temporal integration tasks was suggested system makes its decisions based multiple at stimulus using relatively short time
however our knowledge no model yet stimulus integration time
another major data
functional studies strongly suggest manner structures up through
within processing there increasing response lower response than higher
suggests time over system information depends itself
however no yet been made explain
study present account multiple time scales involved processing
suggest within processing structure important effective integration time information
highly model terms neural presented
model natural previous models form process higher levels responses lower levels via feedback
without model account not only wide range data but also novel data processing
