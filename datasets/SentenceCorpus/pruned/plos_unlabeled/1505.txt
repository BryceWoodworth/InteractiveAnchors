development approaches biology genetic whose behavior so gain into their structure function
however most gene cell under control signals thus quantitative between experimental data mathematical model difficult
biology been one quantitative models biological processes over cycle been few organisms
most cases complex feedback been
here present first modeling results
two genes been shown play central role
find their expression time model feedback
best data under obtained when not cycle
suggests specific time no effect when cycle
property may strategy impact core type been considered when robustness
introduction
gene activity now allow us complex behavior regulatory networks underlying cell functions
however understanding behavior even few molecular depends not only interaction network but also response times its
mathematical description regulatory network thus necessary understand its behavior but
state variables parameters subject large complexity actual network structure
genetic usually not but larger network given gene involved different pathways
thus important identify gene whose behavior model
one strategy been construct networks design
recent experiments shown quantitative obtained when needed detailed various biochemical processes
another strategy study natural gene whose function makes them relatively stable
biological processes cycle many organisms natural genetic most environmental
experiments models become more complex single gene networks feedback
here report good between mathematical model single feedback expression two central genes
known one most groups
very simple cellular only one one
its small genome sequence revealed high very low gene
cell cycle under control cell at end
cell they different under constant conditions phase depend time
very recently some been molecular et al
since related been studied they genome higher genes found only two similar central genes
two genes expression both under constant conditions
functional analysis strategy showed important genes
increased levels while lower levels
furthermore was shown conserved sequence required activity
whether work negative feedback could not study since rely more than simple negative feedback
genes were core first model based where similar gene whose proteins
however model did not well expression was extended experimental data
current models feature several feedback
us investigate whether feedback model where would relevant
not only found model but data under obtained when no model parameter depends
finding suggests not across cycle but only during specific time numerical simulations
article propose conditions strategy natural
