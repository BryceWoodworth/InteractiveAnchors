important functional do not proteins
present highly efficient computational motifs
previous methods does not require alignment input rna motifs low sequence
also rna prediction rna search quality rna motifs significantly
here report results
our motifs include most known elements found rna family database
comparing our models models achieve high accuracy both prediction level secondary structure prediction
not find evidence some them functional analyze several potential protein
introduction
recent novel suggest important functional regulatory impact gene transcription
few years several groups performed computational predictions based comparative genomic analysis
particular et al used approach novel genomes many now been experimentally
similar studies been various groups
more recent work extended large number known while novel
some approaches similar search conserved secondary structures based sequence similarity
typically use measures information between pairs alignment signal regions
however signals methods mutations signals may alignment methods sequences
even local may key structural signal making methods alignment quality especially sequences
paper present novel computational prediction
but does not require sequence
previous methods three
first sequences genes instead regions methods
second predict rna motifs sequences using called very rna motifs low sequence robust long regions sequences
finally rna prediction rna search
every predicted genome database more then used model
process model
study apply elements
because large number genomes sequence among species our approach
our approach two key
first efficient highly
more efficient than later apply between so analysis
thus even though use some algorithms larger problems
rna prediction also gene context functional analysis biological evaluation
second highly accurate finding especially rna elements
demonstrate performance approach report our search results relatively model many known
method low rates negative low rates known
rna family database database elements b
among our predictions lower our
two other also represented among our predictions
addition both secondary structure prediction identified family
above percent percent sensitivity average family percent percent sensitivity secondary structure prediction
many novel were also discussed below
