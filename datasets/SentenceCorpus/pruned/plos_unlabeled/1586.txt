approach investigate relationship underlying motion integration cells
approach detailed model neurons perform here motion integration
model neurons model motion detection provide model without active along their perform
found both active model neurons perform well motion
addition all same real cells
addition also found distribution g g active models
moreover demonstrate how distribution motion integration
using approach predict still unknown distribution g g their role motion integration cells
introduction
neurons different brain regions feature different distributions
while physiological effects distributions how computational functions perform their still known
computational function defined here resulting biological
understanding neurons close input dynamics during known both correlated
one example cells visual motion demonstrated motion
recently developed approach relationships
underlying assumption structure computational function performed
approach computational function interest model neurons including perform function
here apply approach investigate relationship
focus particular type cells motion
cells motion signals their
they spatial activity individual cell
while membrane potential cells at sites synaptic input fast input dynamics time signal temporal their local motion
output signal direction presented stimulus
thus function single cell temporal motion produce output signal
optimization performed work
described assume temporal
aim study identify required perform motion integration investigate how physiological processes perform motion integration
work notion temporal different model neurons perform
found our model neurons features real cell intrinsic dynamics show similarity real cells
our results provide alternative support hypothesis motion integration cells
moreover our simulations were able identify required perform motion integration account temporal active used responses visual
due similarity our models real cells predict actual but still unknown distribution three their role integration cells
discuss our results compare our findings related approach
