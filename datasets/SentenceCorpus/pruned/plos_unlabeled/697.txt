modeling changes still efficient solution developed conformational states protein similar approach
database residues long was through identification set protein structures
contains more than observed per length different variation levels
analysis performance revealed average structural protein structures more than percent within mean distance 1
able protein structures average accuracy
expected structures well but many regions appear at first also found form structural lower frequency than secondary structures
larger regions could smaller elements between residues long
finally observed significant amount short sequences tend strong structural between extended
when sequence length increases sequence no observed context structures
introduction
structure proteins protein via experimental methods occurs at significantly than novel protein sequences
result less than percent human proteins known structure protein data other species significantly lower
addition structures one small number protein domains thus only total sequence protein
modeling using related proteins known structures model
into two related amino given detection changes required new sequence
proteins relatively close terms sequence problem usually but many cases best shows less than percent target small changes likely required obtain accurate model
recent protein modeling based observation protein structures finite structural
structural classification protein database database classification
classification usually protein domain since large proteins generally multiple domains
classification protein domains evolutionary structural relationships
more thus secondary structure been proposed set conformational states derived
different research groups demonstrated when protein structures sets protein
prediction approaches known structures into structure
methods assumption made local interactions particular conformational bias but do not define local structure
instead environmental constraints will determine overall protein
model three first step involves selection based their stability measured function
second step
step obtained structure through field
method well small all class proteins well all class proteins
approach been applied structure prediction algorithm also new
however they typically small consider between residues
instance residues while found only length
structural classes based residues
their method set protein found proteins at
low approaches single length thus resulting limited set might advantage terms computational structure prediction methods will also lead significant loss information
et al made possible variable at least residues through their algorithm
more alignment they
alternative approach et al uses generated small instead sampling known protein structures
properties they consistent fixed protein structure
our strategy set structural without using data
set protein structures into residues because tests lack high structural similarity more than percent all when larger were considered
clustering techniques were identify structural motifs different protein structures
over structures classes were found each considered length when structural variation length was
suggested important determine how well classes space order estimate its value
when applied protein structures not used database out percent average using 1 threshold
latter cases studied regions also
through global algorithm were generated having average accuracy
ability use local secondary structure prediction was examined at relationship within classes
according previous findings sequence within classes was rather low because large number determined different
analysis quantitative structure
significant amount small sequences tend strong structural length percent pairs sequences structural difference within range
sequences sequences structural strong preference residues
more than residues sequence no observed need additional context determine secondary structure much reduced
