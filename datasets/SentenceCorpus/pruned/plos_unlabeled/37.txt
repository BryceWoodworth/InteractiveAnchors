important field understand interactions other functional genes
correlation methods functional work proteins will tend show common pattern presence across range genomes
describe maximum likelihood statistical model predicting functional gene
method independent correlated gain loss pairs proteins high rates observed methods do not explicitly
show protein pairs method up percent analyses at known proteins
method shows protein pairs at least two three correlated events gain loss almost
evolution one presence depends upon presence another also may identify genes whose functional depends upon its interaction other genes
information prediction functional
having lower rate analyses methods into datasets identify sets protein gene networks
introduction
evidence two more across range species used test about common about functional adaptive relationship between them
correlated evolution being applied at genetic level genes together show similar expression patterns rates evolution may form functional
provides computational approach large genomic datasets functional help identify functions genes
analyses also used describe metabolic networks gene clusters genes common function
genes their expression patterns context functional adaptive value tend conserved species
among related species also produce correlated gene genes not
two more genes might common evolutionary their individual adaptive functions
1 shows how produce evidence functional when measured across species
comparison multiple independent events pairs genes make statistical case functional
methods uses they make possible investigate states identify temporal changes two
knowledge two first evolutionary history used test about effect one another
our interest evaluate whether information identification functional gene
need take account relationships comparative studies long been evolutionary biology but less attention studies apply method correlated evolution among pairs data presence pairs genes
method independent events correlated evolution comparing statistical likelihood observed data under two alternative scenarios one two genes another they
evolution markov process evidence model correlated evolution means likelihood
our species complete complete genomes available
there no limit number species used but important use genomes genes determined fact not genome
compare predictions predictions derived latter been used predict functional gene use information protein sequences database yeast proteins known criterion measure
functional been determined therefore provide functional species
find information predictions up percent over functional so pairs genes greater evidence functional
number times pair genes been strong predictor functional protein pairs at least two three correlated events almost
