new maximum likelihood approach called order likelihood presented applied problem functional site prediction protein structures important current
input properties derived structure protein
information where available may also
features combined regression form maximum likelihood estimates probabilities specific residues active site
allows likelihood all residues given protein based features
corresponding statistical tests demonstrate method prior methods turn been shown previously other methods active site residues
then shown addition one simple property size rank given performance
method include predictions residues through introduction environment variables
results even better performance than best functional site predictor based structure only same level performance methods use both structure sequence alignment data
finally method also sequence alignment data when information resulting method shown best current methods using any combination sequence structures
analysis when features size rank used combination features represent single most important component
introduction
development function prediction major
structural structures expressed proteins high basis
however function structure functions most structural proteins unknown
based predictive methods help functional
first step prediction function protein its structure determine its local site interaction where recognition occurs
many important practical biology
reported theoretical technique prediction local interaction sites protein its structure
application one structure protein using methods then procedure sites functions
residues involved recognition different properties residues
particular important residues theoretical
difference information theoretical residues potential function
only structure protein sequence structural used
recently was shown among methods based structure protein only far best performance measured sensitivity residues
present paper present maximum likelihood approach called order likelihood improve performance active site prediction
then shown input data previous statistical support vector machine when applied test set protein structures
then demonstrated one additional feature size each result some performance demonstrated tests
introduction environment features then use data predict both residues
together size rank feature results simple functional site predictor better than other structure based methods well very best current methods both structure sequence
finally approach able take advantage sequence when available addition features
when additional information resulting classifier shown all other available methods using any combination structure sequence information
prior identification residues structure protein were described their first functions
first functions probability density functions give when over all space
et al third central probability functions were used
measure area under relative area mean
et al first second central were also used
each approaches measure normal analyses identify residues most normal behavior
prior approaches all use spatial clustering so residues reported positive method if only if they close spatial at least one other
thus previous involve two where first makes binary decision each second spatial clusters
new approach reported here every probability
here alternative clustering approach introduce features describe call environment features
given feature define value environment feature given whose distance d less than weight given 2
study use same features used approach along additional features
thus every any protein structure feature vector
present approach number
specifically active residues may selected one step they according probability active site
furthermore while previously been applied residues only present approach direct prediction active site residues because environment features well defined all residues including ones
finally additional features structure only may combined four features order performance
features relative protein structure been shown active site
instance proteins residues
however features do not perform well active prediction particularly because they not very
shown here size information combined features high performance structure based functional site predictions
