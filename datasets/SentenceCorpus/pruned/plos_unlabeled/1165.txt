based set structures different binding states conformational transition pathway binding process using molecular dynamics method corresponding energy using linear response approximation version protein method
simulation results suggest process binding initial interaction binding at three pairs interactions across
binding process similar binding model reported
simulation also shows transition mechanism 2 form complex during binding large conformational changes
simulation study binding process conformational changes context leads model been proposed previously
introduction
family energy binding changes turn dna
large efficient well protein family
high structures different binding states been previously reported including states
three structures motion during conformational binding
along central
despite studies above detailed conformational corresponding associated binding process unknown computational approach using molecular dynamics molecular dynamics
molecular dynamics molecular system under conformational changes
however current computational size studied system time scale simulation
studies larger more complex systems molecular dynamics been used simulation additional physical potential reduce mean between current structure structure
transition pathways between two known protein
combination methods been widely applied dynamics studies various systems signal transition pathway system complex human receptor
here whole transition pathway used accurate conformational change certain key time
order understand aspects conformational changes binding process associated conformational changes
first state binding original structure
then used approach transition pathway state bound state examined binding process conformational transition
results suggest through process before being
binding along binding pathway were using linear response approximation version protein method method binding free significantly than methods accuracy
addition simulation results conformational transition pathway previously observed structures
