fundamental wide range cellular metabolic physiological behavioral
although small number key genes been identified through molecular genetic studies past existence other key genes how they gene expression different still remains unknown
here address questions all available data
identified common genes showed wide range consistency across
across human showed known key genes were compared human compared
gene regulatory network was after analysis transcription factor data
observed significant different genes
analysis network structure revealed through identified central control genes through environmental signals
our study our understanding structure design principle evolution gene regulatory networks involved
introduction
mechanism fundamental wide range species
basic molecular mechanism been studied
been shown negative feedback set key genes

through many years molecular genetic studies at least key genes per family family been identified
now proteins form complex transcription per family genes through their
per family proteins form complex activity thus negative feedback
other key genes also been shown important
since there been series experiments at genes at level various species including human
experiments usually identified genes gene expression
however data further experiments they used experimental conditions sampling times etc indeed experiments so far not been compared
few cases where two were studied single experiment genes between was very limited
set common genes exists most cell types integration different datasets multiple could potentially identify common set genes
comparison genes their patterns across different help us understand functions
comparison across different species also molecular mechanisms lead their different behaviors
because many known key genes transcription factors regulation must important role gene expression
et al gene regulatory network genes elements based
however gene regulatory network at system level based analysis been almost due transcription factor binding site prediction
existence other elements associated
other hand there large body experiments transcription factor available at
experiment results sequence analysis identification functional transcription factor binding sites
general analysis gene regulatory networks involved will improve our understanding how key genes genes will way more detailed quantitative modeling
