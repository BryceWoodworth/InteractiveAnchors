however how datasets related physiological using research methods body methods
thus fundamental research data at different spatial temporal scales
although statistical analysis still method choice high datasets systems biology computational modeling approaches quantitative relationships between various measurements
large variety computational modeling approaches been applied levels molecules humans

research processes necessary life health
research processes at level whole
all organisms exist state far
state central importance sufficient energy
energy protein
principle expressed dynamic energy theory energy distributed body processes essential life
processes include across cell structural
energy world
principle clear
contrast energy sources elements also play key role overall health
some been demonstrated
third class various essential exist used both energy structural well specific
include essential amino essential
many health not but more generally between
while there general various understanding health effects specific
first difficult control over long time often relatively effects over time scales typically investigated
second very difficult interest when other components
third difficult interest especially at level specific target cells
problem at whole body level had long history mathematical modeling specifically elements
computational methods were introduced along use stable where data required development appropriate mathematical models
typically modeling approaches used describe distribution
common most models high level where body described only few
together models aim provide rational basis body understanding differences different
while modeling methods been very useful real modeling help understand complex relationship between health determined responses whole body levels over time scales years
difficulty problems current role metabolic
at long time scale whole body level more energy than results development increases risk metabolic
study revealed function at level occurs time scale
example output other physiological effects occur time scale
methods developed molecular mechanisms underlying effects shown complex signal pathways changes gene expression molecular
furthermore cells occurs response amino all
unique properties cells while behavior time scales
thus understanding how mechanisms underlying requires quantitative analysis description highly regulatory network components over whole body levels time scales years
although perspective above derived literature without too much effort difficult develop quantitative understanding complexity mechanisms involved
principle mathematical models therefore required more understand physiological basis not only metabolic but role health disease general
without quantitative approach one will models find relative importance each component interaction overall physiological
field mathematical modeling very no single mathematical allows one generate required quantitative understanding above
therefore our what needed years now review several models key questions together may help point way more modeling approach
first review modeling approaches processes at cellular level biochemical processes into energy cell fundamental life
into processes us how at its most basic level
furthermore modeling at cellular level provides point complexity data
second review use metabolic analysis framework quantitative analysis within single cell well between different cell populations up whole body level
thus natural between different levels different time scales
review models because major between many processes associated metabolic
finally review mathematical models body weight regulation complex relationship at whole body level
modeling at whole body physiological level importance long time scales like metabolic
cannot all modeling field review
instance will not review models processes components into important
another important area will not review models regulation
models review process space time years
therefore four modeling discuss provide basis our goal review available computational approaches key central questions development more systems models
