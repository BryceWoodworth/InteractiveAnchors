mechanism pattern formation not
current models represent scenarios describe pattern formation through local interactions one recent model model
model local where increase cells formation
here present mathematical model uses features model further global characteristics pattern formation
used approximate
applied system based framework
our model direct correlation between pattern formation size
relationship between domain pattern
model consistency patterns among individuals within species based global characteristics provides critical pattern formation
introduction
patterns their complexity
groups patterns different humans attention
though many development understanding how form what factors determine still limited
across species variety also wide
evolutionary development patterns might provide about development taking place humans
major how patterns form was introduction hypothesis
hypothesis where strongly regions together pattern
hypothesis concept between patterns among individuals not just random
other models also been proposed explain central system
recently been suggested pattern based patterns cells
model upon cell hypothesis states during development certain cells cells
cells amount neurons given
furthermore subset cells local neurons resulting

new hypothesis still being if correct could pattern formation
here relatively simple mathematical model proposed explain how cell distributed
our model call global model uses system determine activation cells
model allows initial underlying observed complex patterns
also initial pattern global
global provides critical development
