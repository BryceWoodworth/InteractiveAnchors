both strong whereas only signal
used computational model based physiological measurements determine source
our results tree into regions each its local synaptic
within each local region local threshold response over response basis
using previously measured simulation results showed only sufficient cannot affect
therefore will only within
identified role three mechanisms generate local regions
first mechanism intrinsic structure tree
second robust but
third necessary because more robust across tree
mechanisms together local intrinsic
local mechanisms perform independent make decision there could mechanisms within
introduction
cell stimuli but only
most strongly over limited range stimulus direction response called direction while stimulus direction called direction little no response
responses
neurons at both stimulus within field
leading field will produce if wide relative extent low will produce distinct
their original description output was produced stimuli only small
they proposed synaptic mechanism were across field
contrast most cells initial tree
thought similar neurons other regions brain where important signal processing
observations suggest some type local processing could provide basis proposed
evidence was observed low appear when local application
high probability because they seen under normal conditions
further both responses strongly stimuli whereas potential shows relatively
does not mechanism used most other cells synaptic integration where at synaptic over tree
instead suggests synaptic generate local then process
addition other mechanisms also important its response
essential mechanisms both synaptic
both relative function direction
further integration been signals
resulting direction could produce signals two could could their
however relative mechanisms remains
initial theoretical studies suggested mechanisms might some experimental support
however more recently mechanisms most significant
issue relative mechanisms model
investigate how processing synaptic could models physiological data obtained prior
models synaptic
goal was explore how synaptic affect compare known physiological properties
our simulations show regions but within local regions high probability tree
therefore active take place during
