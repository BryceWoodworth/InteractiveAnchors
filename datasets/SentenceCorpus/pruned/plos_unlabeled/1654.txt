behavioral evidence suggests humans make optimal decisions despite uncertainty tasks
key question how populations neurons probabilistic
article develop framework optimal integration memory dynamic environment
propose probability distributions networks neurons
result networks cues state stimulus evidence over much than time constant single neurons
propose population responses memory states represent probability distributions not only single stimulus values
patterns activity make relevant information available neurons within their short time integration
model neurons predictive only firing account new information not yet been
thus times signal prediction error rate times considered random samples underlying firing rate
patterns same information
results correlated initial conditions but robust even high levels neural noise
one observed but cannot noise
optimal inference
contrast show models perform when neurons
introduction
our us information about world noise
taking uncertainty into account interaction our environment
studies shown humans optimal bayesian they cues their own predictions prior order expected outcome their actions
several theoretical neural mechanisms could probabilistic
variables activity populations neurons whose activity highly variable correlated
individual while distributed
characteristics models probability distributions their average firing rates
previous studies examined how information population how how population combined
particular optimal cue combination simple linear combination neural family neural including noise
however most studies dimension time
most stimuli natural environment requires combined
inference thus cannot based rates measured during fixed temporal used most previous population
at same time decisions typically require integration evidence over time constant single neurons
how could time scale tasks
problem even more if decision compared information
variables direction motion stimulus memory significant time even input
neural memory appear neural activity brain exhibit firing statistics similar those found responses
activity been stable state neural network dynamics
however patterns activity only represent single stimulus value
example position object position stable activity
would though information about cue cannot used cue combination decision making
instead stimuli same input probability distribution
question how probability distributions population neurons remains
here approach using new population context temporal integration
consider rather than rates basic probabilistic representation
show how networks neurons construct probability distributions dynamic variables
neurons results between integration evidence prediction
therefore predictive only if its input cannot predicted its own its past activity
demonstrate networks without information stimulus dynamics even input over much than neural time
framework thus provides first theory optimal integration memory
contrast rate models neurons model does not require large levels noise stochastic
similar neurons model neurons activity
times variable despite rule
however contrast rate each
does not intrinsic source noise requires but predictive
while times at level single they represent probability distribution at level population
leads us signal noise neural responses
