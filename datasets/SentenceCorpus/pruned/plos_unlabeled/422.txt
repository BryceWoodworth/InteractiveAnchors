introduction
protein protein interactions being generated increasing numbers method
now been
more recently been reported human
datasets analysis protein interaction networks
data both make difficult network properties including basic difference between power other network degree distributions
recent review points out rates rates full protein interaction networks
every method estimate based datasets
rates methods large when little indeed could not used analyze existing
estimates rates based datasets may even larger uncertainty
finally global estimates rates little about properties including whether certain classes proteins well
goal work develop apply statistical model interaction
previous methods typically presence interaction binary variable core
method describe observed
statistical method need standard interactions even second
predictions first time tests some classes proteins more less likely interactions
finally estimates rates confidence total number interactions present model
where interaction where interactions may
one protein binding domain yeast transcription factor second protein activation domain
physical interactions between proteins transcription factor activity
due not every protein may selected made into construct
furthermore some may not functional at all due system
interactions important consider when total number interactions

generated cells
each protein protein domain then
yeast considered here tested versus each having genes
each tested one turn versus both
testing occurs using both construct single yeast cell
interactions genes yeast cell
yeast cells whose do not expected out during population
true may also during population at least two
first may lack cells every combination tested
second particular construct may making functional some interactions but others
true interactions not represented cells following population particular
due due domains could principle step population
without additional step however losses during population rate 1 p p rate pair population
some cells proteins may also population population cells will mixture true
1 cells 1 cells total number true rate
usually however respect total number observed interactions defined rate parameter
point two proteins might strong interaction system
proteins strong interaction might
work assume cases any pair proteins interaction true positive
while total may large over many different pairs
most models including assume any particular positive probability specific interaction more than
interactions often require sequencing identify although may improve
cost constraints limit number interactions sequencing
if number selected sequencing smaller than number true interaction some true will
limited sampling also observed degree distribution
rate due 1 p 1
rates typically been estimated comparing datasets up percent but analyses error sources
estimated error rates large uncertainty because few interactions observed multiple datasets
example comparing datasets yeast only percent total interactions common comparing interactions interactions only percent common
comparison two few interactions common
also revealed little reported interactions although protein network evolution additional factors
estimate true number interaction protein used interaction multiple
methods require all interactions true example observations reduce estimated interaction
previous work context protein used bayesian model global parameters rates
parameters then provided estimates probability true interaction given results one more
work important using number trials rather than single observation its probability similar models more sampling process involving strong effects
quantitative predictions amount work required identify some true interactions would genome sequencing would useful new experiments
new work presented here uses data estimate rate together rate
sampling process
interactions two sets one true other true
observations number times each interaction three n total number samples number unique interactions within n s number interactions observed
observations estimate unknown values total number true interaction number within sample n also estimate parameter mixture well parameters probability distribution suggests sampling interactions sampling process occurs each estimation performed each
estimation problem population species experiments size number distinct at particular number literature
theory rates here different probabilities each true interaction
simple s 2 where 2 number observed
setting because does not account
our knowledge been discussed setting
will interaction number observations s total observed standard high when number observations small small value 2
when each observed only n s 2
present statistical model both error rates

overall approach parameters mixture model true following population
us estimate rates rates due
then rate due effects
results together overall estimate rate basis comparing interaction produced different
along way examine our model able address best model protein degree rates properties domains relative performance generated
