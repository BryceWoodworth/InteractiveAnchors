experimental work shown t cells system specifically molecules presented able between potential stimuli based parameters t cell
molecules presented among similar question how t cells make decision certain but not others within cell
theoretical study investigate role between t cell receptor
show signaling state individual during events t cells able based both their rates
demonstrate t cell receptor but not receptor clustering important show signaling signals high concentration
our main results use relatively simple model based
however show all our results when use detailed t cell receptor signaling model
discuss our results context existing models recent experimental work propose new experiments test our findings
introduction
t cells adaptive system use their t cell form specific bound
t cells estimates individual t cell only 1 single if specific
experiments demonstrated t cells specific few 1 similar
also been demonstrated single amino presented t cell response
sensitivity been s characteristics detection t cells
observation t cells do not specific suggests decision occurs within
t search specific unique t interactions
decision signal formation stable between t cell second phase signaling
experiments mathematical modeling been used understand t cell activation
during signaling phase binding many single been increase t cell sensitivity
binding expected because between range 1 s
other hand t cell been model
model series binding associated activation motifs signaling molecules occur upon binding signaling events require
signal only after several taken place
model t cells able between different threshold rate constant
binding between sensitivity optimal formula efficient t cell activation effect been experimentally observed
t cell activation models others usually number over whole cell after relatively long interaction
several studies reported between constant but not formula t cell activation measured after formula
however t cells been observed less than at least t cells stable contact not required detection
models do not predict short time scales part because signals generated high binding found signals generated low high
moreover early t cell response determined parameter formula t at short times
more likely formula important t cell activation during phase signaling well after initial decision
paper investigate mechanism during early phase signaling
specifically examine role t cells make decisions
explicitly within existing membrane reactions find very little effect models
simple signal at allows individual multiple events
model now both rate
sensitivity leads finding t cell between than would predicted model
further show but not clustering important achieve events
addition show signal at does not allow high generate signals
finally show our general when our model detailed model signaling
propose t cells based formula formula via threshold allows t cell responses specific
