prior influence future actions
not only adaptive changes output but they also rate at adaptive changes occur
here studied adaptation ability previously learned task reduce rate learning different task
examined formation adaptive control human amount after task found amount observed learning task b increased task however increase did not instead after trials task found recently proposed model adaptation two distinct but adaptive processes predicts several key features patterns observed
specifically computational model predicts initial growth describe well amount experimentally
understanding mechanisms underlying adaptation may development training
introduction
history prior action human system known influence not only future performance through memory but also future learning
two produce effect
ability one task learning another while ability previous learning future learning
example previous work shown after initial learning task than initial learning even if performance levels at learning
gain adaptation task after learning output levels also observed than initial learning
other studies demonstrated previous learning future learning
experimental used study 2 where subject learn task task b then task often various time between tasks
task b usually made task two types studied how task b memory task 1 how memory task 1 learning task b note both affect performance task 2
although often effects not much attention adaptation literature
because relatively small effect performance studies where reported whereas often larger effects
fact several studies been specifically designed effects because they potential
better understanding mechanisms underlying important not provide greater into effects but because learning phenomenon significant itself primary during adaptation
been observed adaptation studies studies been shown time between tasks increased
computational model adaptation suggested possible mechanism
model one adaptive process error but while another adaptive process error but good
two processes combined generate output
transition task task b fast process will learn new task while process will because its good previous task
model predicts process would adaptation task b resulting
model also predicts training task extended amount will also increase but then level training trials task here using simple effects examine first time how task amount observed task b order determine how up practice
then use predictions model determine whether interactions between different learning
