however cells produce long small input thus time required does not exist
instead been suggested correlated output cells could cells through mechanism called stochastic through correlation two neural
almost all work due correlation fixed
theory experiments others developed show increased cells could produce increase cell activity those cells group cells
common cell input increases input correlation cells hence their positive feedback correlation
thus demonstrate temporal evolution input correlation networks feedback
explore several theoretical models idea models model
introduction
neural activity been suggested activity
activity long been known occur system
activity been proposed play role tasks
similar
using genetic performance tasks
system cell local field example system increases between cells increase power local field potential
cells been shown during responses during
although previous experimental modeling studies role cells exact mechanism cell occurs cell network remains unknown
possible mechanism cells suggested recent experimental evidence
cells activation cell fast second cell
due synaptic activation cells via cell
although individual fast they output cells not time stimulus
produced response first cell results long second cell
there variable delay between second cell times first cell
thus occur average show time constant
addition average small
been shown result long long cell cells
furthermore recent experimental studies into between cells suggests common cells primary mechanism cell
measured properties cell interactions suggest novel mechanism cells
previous studies proposed noise
neurons they should firing should some fast their
recent studies mechanism activity long revealed novel role noise
was shown two cells firing frequency range upon common input cells
degree was shown depend degree correlation input two neurons
although was noise itself was
all experimental theoretical studies stochastic degree correlation fixed
our study degree input correlation within network over time due dynamics network
addition our study derived probability distribution phase difference noise investigate conditions necessary existence input correlation
here consider case correlated cells cells many cells
input correlation any pair cells could increase if cells increased their stochastic firing rate thus greater amount common noise
between cells almost always
thus if cell pair cells those cells also cell
since pair cells correlated input more likely pair also more likely provide correlated input their common cell
turn common cell could then increases its increasing correlation cells
result feedback provides correlation
goal paper use computational techniques show feedback will increase correlation between cells
describe three models feedback correlation stochastic
first study one pair cells one common cell
cells simple phase through their
cell synaptic input cell
second model each phase
finally allow approaches reduce first two models time study using technique
