membrane critical biological processes yet process unknown
current experimental computational model systems approximate complex physiological membrane environment using one few protein species
here report results computational model system components was using simulations up length predict effects both mechanism
our simulations increased increased activation formation initial previous theoretical
also use our large simulation compare mechanism at different significant difference mechanism at different
physiological different examine effect well effect membrane
predicted effects mechanism both way experimental model system may affect observed mechanism potential mechanism cellular regulation process membrane
introduction
membrane key role cellular function processes
also critical
cellular reactions contain complex proteins
potentially both variable cell
variety experimental computational model systems been used gain into basic physical properties underlying membrane
model systems much nature than context one few species protein environment
model systems important consider how chosen may affect results
how changes affect mechanism also provides fundamental aspects robust small model system used highly
experimental data variation important role
much initial work effects either positive negative membrane
most characterized between increased increased thought negative membrane
measured at between
presence been identified critical factor many systems used develop structural models contain higher than levels
theoretical proposed suggest important state been proposed early
other species likely play additional role physiological also
work examine effect approximation first membrane then examine
membrane long been important process
simply highly membrane provide process
most physiological occurs between relatively large even relative site
however local at site been subject much several theories membrane high local at site
recent experimental evidence suggests one proteins model rates
important finding provides more direct evidence highly membrane structures here may play important role physiological may major function protein
physiological may involve highly questions what degree required how may affect formation stability
here report initial results work more phenomenon perspective
because structures detailed difficult experimentally computational simulations play important role detailed structural models consistent available experimental data
simulations allow increase computational at some degree particular made model
model developed provides quantitative approximation experimentally parameters area per group good between computational level
initial results reported membrane model demonstrate either mixture also formation mixture than
were not observed form
work used model predict small
our simulations suggested pathway first form but then either form state via
previous theoretical work suggested two pathways alternative predicted pathways may within single system
our initial report predicted via both pathways but via using pathway
now model address how more complex may affect reaction mechanism
membrane place complex likely mixture multiple species proteins
experimental computational model systems far case computational studies used
given complexity between model systems used studies situation they understand how mechanisms properties depend membrane
therefore performed simulations at different predict how membrane depend
approach similar results those recently obtained using field theory methods
our analyses results prior work computational models more complex membrane better approximate experimental models scenarios
