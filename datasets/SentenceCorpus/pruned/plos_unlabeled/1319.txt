despite molecular dynamics cell stochastic one hand yet other only
one most aspects cell its density
general observation overall determined cell optimal at density
physical finding was optimal density density allows both at cell at cell through
more recently model been based detailed measurements dynamics 1 cells optimal density at density
further through not all membrane only at leading do

among its various functions active protein binding site protein both factor turn
thus pathway positive feedback
example through expression mutation formation whereas expression mutation active responses
influence signaling context strongly effect expected more at higher density
here through computational modeling stochastic simulations develop new about mechanisms might give between cell at leading
analysis model suggests signaling because positive feedback but also regulation other feedback involving stable
regulatory mechanisms density compare experimentally observed dynamics cells
