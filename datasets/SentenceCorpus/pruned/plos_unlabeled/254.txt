position biological systems often through protein concentration
local concentration protein distribution allows position within system
systems work position must robust noise
here fundamental position concentration due biochemical noise
focus proteins reaction
systems type been experimentally both cell biology settings
single show through potentially even very low protein numbers
second example investigate ability system find its
mechanism close more increasing time so times higher numbers required high
both single demonstrate existence optimal length scales well analyze how depends size
results provide fundamental constraints concentration various including both biology also within single cell
introduction
determine position biological system some component within system must spatial distribution
often through formation protein concentration
typically when protein within small region
local concentration position relative source determined
biology where used control patterns gene expression proteins called
however concentration also thought important single cells
mechanism position must therefore robust noise
one system another will
rates
physical size system will also may affect
most previous analyses focused robustness changes factors between different system
however there will also intrinsic noise within single system example due nature biochemical reactions involved
into intrinsic components introduced into analysis stochastic gene expression
however here intrinsic noise not only overall protein numbers but also protein distribution
even if all variation could intrinsic biochemical noise would still lead fundamental limit position similar way protein concentration
paper therefore address question how concentration information simple but relevant formation mechanism reaction
quantitative measurements example system shown obtained
understanding fundamental concentration important issue biology
our results will relevant form within single cells where protein numbers few will lead large density
properties protein been studied
recently number been observed experimentally both systems
factor cell membrane
site selection
complex also order direct site selection cell
dynamics proteins cell
using mechanisms site achieve 1 percent cell length
cell cells also concentration
example yeast protein concentration cell cell protein cell
cells proteins formation growth
may also play role activation between cell protein activation
biological system identify particular position along its length cell
examples complex essential cell protein cell membrane
since higher cell cell
below some critical threshold concentration will form
where concentration within cell
our analysis simply existence critical where signal
any real cannot certain amount
furthermore there will additional noise process actually concentration due both binding proteins receptor molecules also reactions process signal
general noise output signal processing network noise input signal reactions processing network
assume here processing network do not any noise input signal
result our variation lower any real system will lower
first considered system single source linear average concentration
while model very simple remains relevant both
been measured shown average high accuracy
then expected distribution where concentration threshold
cellular numbers few proteins system would identify correct threshold position single
achieve position concentration must over time
show measurements biological system able achieve position few percent system size even protein result computer simulations
furthermore find position when particular choice length made
also show how depends size
possible after certain time depends only very size
all results experimental measurements yeast
also considered ability two identify system discussed above
related also been proposed control
before find system particular choice length
however if threshold position set at system more than model
find few proteins may therefore required high
our results strongly possible proteins two systems
