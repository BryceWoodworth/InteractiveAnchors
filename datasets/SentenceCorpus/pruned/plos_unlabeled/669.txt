introduction
dynamic cellular processes response signaling event complex regulatory networks
networks typically involve large number transcription factors different order produce particular cellular response
cell type system variety responses
system first against play role distinct molecular patterns rna
signals first through molecules then through signal pathways
pathways program over genes genes expressed type
network underlying activation exhibit many distinct associated functions
response also dynamic characterized temporal gene activation each distinct sets gene functions likely different
network underlying activation key their functions would our understanding response potentially new development
computational analysis experimental data useful inference regulatory interaction networks identification potential experimental
expression measurements been used dynamic networks yeast influence networks cell
context primary computational control underlying activation program not difficult measure several
first control within networks general key genes particular
second many subject activation dynamic control
third genetic perform large scale model expression difficult due tendency vector
finally few regulatory interactions been through experiments primary not available single standard
therefore context regulation expression data sets computational inference useful potential regulatory interactions rather than inference predicting control specific target genes
described above order regulatory interactions system necessary include additional sources evidence network model selection
computational sequences clusters genes known transcription factor binding site motifs particularly when combined global expression data
recently et al used combination expression clustering sequence motifs construct initial network stimulus
their work identified two novel but clustering was based expression single stimulus limited biological few time points
moreover clusters without expression dynamics provides only limited underlying network
many motifs often multiple making difficult identification
furthermore because tendency motifs difficult determine among set motifs associated most relevant regulation target
core transcription factors expressed cell regulation second genes
genes key analysis dynamic expression data data
work using computational data integration identify set core expressed form statistical associations clusters genes they may
clusters based temporal activation sense associations dynamic network
achieve used novel computational approach statistical inference based expression data across stimuli
our approach involved four
set genes was identified were expressed under at least one experiment
genes were based their expression across wide range conditions genes based similarity their
gene were used identify functional within gene clusters
sequences genes within each were motifs each at least one expressed identify possible associations between gene clusters
across different studies dynamic expression genes target genes were compared order identify possible between expressed genes clusters
several techniques been developed specifically model inference expression data dynamic bayesian networks model selection
however complexity model classes makes difficult apply them network underlying specific cellular limited expression
here potential regulatory influence expression data using correlation been used biochemical interaction networks well networks
advantage time delay between expression expression target gene
contrast standard methods identify genes method uses temporal expression determine whether time between two correlated genes consistent interaction
developed novel method identify optimal time each gene pair used prior probability distribution time possible interactions
evidence evidence obtained correlation analysis expression data were able identify network significant associations between genes clusters
overall percent expressed genes network
network provided into temporal response into may key activation
finally analysis identified potential was not previously known play role activation
experimental network two were binding elements using were genes four out predicted target clusters at significantly higher than expected random set genes
