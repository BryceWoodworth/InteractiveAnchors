increasing importance rna biology interest problem rna structure prediction
case proteins rna structure prediction methods require two key accurate energy function conformational sampling procedure
both only problems
here focus problem conformational sampling
current state solution based methods construct together short obtained experimental structures
however nature use energy functions their nature sampling
solution sampling problem important probabilistic model rna structure allows efficient sampling rna continuous space associated probabilities
show model several key features rna structure its nature distribution
furthermore model out test structures using information

introduction
rna importance cell where key regulatory structural
understanding exact mechanisms functions therefore importance both biology
many cases understanding requires knowledge rna structure
however structure rna experimentally typically time difficult task
therefore algorithms rna structure prediction much interest main focus predicting secondary structure
many been made area secondary structure most recently introduction statistical sampling had important impact
past years increasing number relevant structures become available much been made understanding three structure rna
conformational space rna been using methods proteins rna base pair interactions been conformational space rna been into
new several useful tools modeling rna structure significant prediction recently been reported
however prediction rna structure still remains important open problem between number known sequences determined structures problem more more
two key algorithms rna structure prediction accurate energy function conformational sampling procedure both only problems
here focus latter problem
current state rna conformational sampling based methods construct together short obtained experimental structures
methods important related protein rna structure prediction years
methods not
one problems associated methods they continuous conformational space hence do not all relevant
since conformational search procedure energy use energy terms requires continuous methods cannot provide
other words conformational sampling method need energy function
furthermore full conformational importance complete understanding rna binding dynamics
another fundamental problem methods their nature makes their use framework statistical
particularly sampling markov framework using function
other words using unknown additional term energy function
means simulation dynamics rna under control empirical using methods
developed new solution conformational sampling probabilistic model called rna structure natural continuous space
makes possible sample short length scale
model used distribution but also energy term local
long range interactions between local model task global energy function
dynamic bayesian network sequential nature rna statistics statistics representation data
model not only but also statistical making theoretical well
approach related probabilistic models protein structure recently proposed our group
however model presented here far rna many more than rna there per two proteins
many combined limited number experimentally determined rna structures make particularly statistical task very different strategy was required
particular approach used proteins would case rna require use probability density function statistical computational
below describe probabilistic model show aspects local rna structure
also demonstrate its context rna prediction end possible applications
