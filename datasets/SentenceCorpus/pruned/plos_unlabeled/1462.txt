experimental observations demonstrate protein stability often upon point mutation
contrast less known about effects large sequence structure changes stability particular
almost unknown degree stability different regions protein generally evolution
work questions through analysis large sample protein space based yet
more than proteins were using algorithm
estimated stability its component entropy were compared between all proteins sample according structural alignment
was local pairs were significantly more correlated than those pairs local stability was indeed generally conserved evolution
however entropy underlying stability were less correlated overall stability protein was more important than mechanism achieve stability
finally two different types evolutionary relationships were
first many proteins regions similar despite structure change mechanism evolutionary change
second some proteins similar structures different local phenomenon previously observed experimentally
two observations proteins generally conserved local stability may provide future classification protein
introduction
protein structure function determined
example work demonstrated state protein exists at minimum free energy stability under physiological conditions
binding also free free energy change each functional reaction direction extent
free energy results often entropy g t s generally case proteins changes free energy small compared underlying changes
reactions either entropy but most often case between entropy protein structure function
goal protein each predict
while terms information derived entropy estimate knowledge not single structure information about conformational protein
task robust analysis stability within protein rather than stability protein whole
due part difficulty global local entropy free energy all protein structure classification strategies do not information
our hypothesis theoretical complete understanding protein space
there may also practical
example possible information protein independent sequence structure could improve computational tools sequence alignment recognition detection existing classification based only sequence structure
information may also new understanding not available current about evolutionary sequence structure functional relationships
one particularly important yet question degree protein stability its components conserved during does concept exist point mutations
step towards integration information into existing protein classification local free energy stability entropy here large database protein domains using previously described algorithm
proteins studied evolutionary relationships any
thus experimental design between related proteins explicitly analysis
central aim work degree among protein domains
three findings protein sequence structure reported
first previous work proteins exhibit correlated information
second entropy less correlated than stability sequence differences result changes local stability protein compared one
third based structural pairs proteins framework future integration information into theories protein evolution
