introduction
many biological social networks evolutionary process their growth
how networks over time help us answer questions about why observed network structures exist how they may change future
analyses network growth dynamics studied how properties structure change over time how structural patterns been how information network
however many cases only network available without history changes
biology domain where networks been species into organisms
example while do few interaction networks organisms networks do not form linear instead derived species at tree
networks years evolution changes at level
social networks typically only single current available due simply because network was not since its
lack data makes understanding how network difficult
often although do not know past do know general principle growth
several network growth models been widely used explain features observed networks
models provide procedure random graphs exhibit similar features class real networks
example many properties world wide
model was found et al model best d protein interaction network
model was shown produce networks properties degree distribution similar properties online social networks
although random graph models themselves been useful understanding global changes network network will generally not target network
means history random graph will not history real network
hence growth random networks only explore properties model cannot individual observed through time
problem however if instead random graph according evolutionary model actual observed network time model
resulting sequence networks history network
networks many applications
used estimate nodes model evolution interactions network clusters motifs
addition proposed growth models corresponding history best known history other information
et al explore idea likelihood model based how well model each observed given complete history network
model its ability certain global network properties itself
example et al found networks according model property d network but did not empirical network other aspects
et al made similar observation social network models
also used network but smaller network key properties
used graph algorithms
biological network setting network provide view evolution derived sequence data
social network setting if only single network network would allow us estimate when particular network its activity since being
could might need additional network
some been made find small graphs particular models may
et al under model et al under model found graphs likely produce graphs properties
graphs thought graphs at very large but techniques them do not do they
previous studies networks solve related network inference problems but assume different available data
example use random graph models other approaches dynamic networks requires observed attributes at each time point
they also limited because they use models without biological mechanism require set nodes known at each time point
et al use importance sampling most likely parameters network c according model but they do not explicitly networks
et al only model loss gain fixed set nodes metabolic networks
there also been some work biological networks using gene
approaches play gene tree
gene tree provides view evolutionary history should network history but their relationship also
further gene tree approaches only loss do not account models evolution only consider per gene family
network alignment between two species also been used find conserved network structures
however methods do not model evolution interactions do so using heuristic measures
finally study biological sequences long history work
sequence been used genes their function understand how environment affected genomes determine amino life
similar questions network setting however requires significantly different
here propose framework graphs at many network growth models
our efficient heuristic high likelihood graphs using only information each history each
gain confidence procedure show using data network models even presence some network noise
when applied interaction network history many previously predicted features network evolution
estimates protein when using model known related proteins events
addition predicts proteins more likely at core protein result obtained via other means
comparing predicted protein using different models further better mechanism model growth networks compared model model designed social networks
when applied social network model does not produce accurate network model also social network context at task who growth new
thus models social network evolution do not well biological networks expected notion through alternative means
also used our history network make several novel predictions
example estimate time interactions predict often proteins within same complex recently many
history also used change network properties over time clustering find been recent evolution
analysis rates over history suggests proteins interactions been involved number events existing belief proteins many interactions more
addition predicts relationships between proteins strongly network estimates
thus history makes number detailed predictions about relative order events evolution yeast many known biology many novel
ability algorithms significant features history further utility models network evolution suggests alternative approach growth models some history network single
