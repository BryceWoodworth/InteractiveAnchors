more than times number
many derived regions yet they contain features necessary correct processing
analysis only few conserved between species
there large potential regulatory interactions genomes investigated
some interactions may under special environmental conditions while others when organisms new
introduction
small now major control gene expression
most well known small both derived processing molecules family
their not their mechanism action
genome their major mechanism action thought regulation through target leading specific target
most were so highly conserved evolution was had conserved
those early been used number groups predict new genes
methods genome potential form
typically find order depending genome size search parameters
high number then reduced only conserved other species
another approach search only sequences form expressed sequence
method genomes search space leading lower number but method also not expressed sequence
version genes most conserved
however studies rna shown lack does not mean lack function
potentially all one many genome necessary structure sequence features
indeed large numbers more conserved also exist
recent study human identified patterns associated suggested number larger than
similar situation could exist
sequencing effort using sequence technique revealed distinct small rna species large variety genomic including dna regions
not other studies finding large genomes also genes
necessary feature any functional must target at least one
means must almost some part
set rules only certain been suggested based experimental observations
target previously been used predict instead methods used potential target find potentially target
will structure dynamics formation other events provide sequences almost gene one gene other genes
not between species matching more potential regulation
effort reduce predictions new existing regions
although increase they also introduce biases sequences not functional each sequence only one function
however been demonstrated recent work several groups show common
et al point human associated transcription
et al experimentally characterized human different types elements
conserved other genomes authors predict additional novel derived
observations along evidence very complex patterns including transcription importance all possible interactions order explore full potential regulation
paper develop apply perform matching classification using support vector
using method three genomes p find almost targets
present many active natural selection organisms
