introduction
dna exists
however dna also other structural potential play critical range biological processes
one structure dna was when biochemical experiments demonstrated contain four two three four form structures
dna structures together between four each
single multiple may
dna structures highly stable under physiological conditions even higher than dna
dna structures two but they less stable than those
dna structure interest because its potential influence variety biological processes
example dna most organisms sequence single form
first direct evidence presence dna structures studies using structures at where their formation cell cycle
however described paper not only sequences ability form dna structures
because experimental functions dna structures difficult especially at computational analyses increasing role identification regions potential form dna structures
distribution dna motifs been investigated s human number genomes patterns will provide into functional structures
each case computational search dna usually four three more regions any was performed
across wide range species dna motifs were found within dna
human genome genes dna motifs into specific functional example genes particularly high low dna potential
recently human dna motifs were reported associated regions show patterns potential form dna structures
computational analysis s identified several dna motifs found them significantly associated regions extent open
thus studies wide range organisms dna structures affect multiple cellular processes their at

evolutionary across related species role functional elements genes regulatory sites
identified sequence motifs potential form structures s other species evolutionary sequence motifs across species
found dna motifs them were more conserved than expected however they were not strongly conserved genes many known regulatory sites
patterns within motifs evolutionary was likely result ability motifs form dna structures
analysis provides strong evidence many identified dna motifs form functional dna structures
