cellular key understand their robustness both mutations noise
many biochemical parameters behavior thus not
existing work area what extent function any one given robust
but high robustness would expected many similar
how high robustness about through evolution changes one interaction at time
here questions model regulation networks explore different network
robustness mutations noise correlated networks
they show distribution very small number networks being more robust than
all networks given gene expression state into graph whose nodes networks differ their
graph changes network
thus robustness property
robust networks may general principle biological networks
addition exists also rna protein structures may thus general principle all biological systems
introduction
biochemical parameters determine behavior cellular systems proteins regulatory networks change
change two sources
one them genetic mutations
other noise environmental change
contrast mutations relatively noise
much stochastic variation gene expression expression regulation
noise makes all biochemical parameters behavior appear
environmental change change affect many parameters at
observations suggest biological not their functions only values their biochemical parameters
instead they must able function under range different parameters
other words they must robust parameter change
lead robustness processes development
quantitative models cellular help us understand processes different cell cycle development behavior
several classes models used represent biological networks
first class models
continuous state variables gene
interactions gene represented through biochemical parameters binding dna rate
universal problem quantitative information about biochemical parameters even experimentally systems
other words some knowledge who may exist but interactions usually unknown
even where measurements biochemical parameters available they often estimates rather than quantitative measurements known
difficulty leads one second class models only nature state variables considered
our focus here not consider any one but many
because changes biochemical parameters lack quantitative information about their values approach appropriate fundamental properties cellular particular one may what features robustness
work out analysis model regulation networks important functions processes
despite its level model highly regulatory dynamics early genes well predicting
also why often show genetic variation how adaptive evolution robustness occurs genetic networks given
most recently explain how robustness
model regulatory network n represented their expression patterns s at some time t during process one cell domain
time scale expression dynamics time scale regulation order not order complete development
influence each expression through interactions matrix elements matrix regulatory influence gene gene i influence either
matrix system while expression state its
model change expression state s network time t according difference where constant function whose values
regulation gene expression other genes
here networks whose expression dynamics initial state s at some time t during development at stable target expression state s will call networks networks
initial state determined regulatory factors network may represent signals environment other domains
expressed stable state s affect expression genes network
modeling assumption their expression critical development
thus s highly
because our work framework s s play central contrast most studies properties random networks
here examine relationship between robustness network networks different
structure matrix because each one regulatory interaction among genes
changes loss regulatory interaction new regulatory interaction was previously
changes occur very short evolutionary time scales particular higher large regulatory regions
need study their effects network robustness
our analysis first how robustness mutations noise within networks different
more also whether highly robust low robustness through changes
