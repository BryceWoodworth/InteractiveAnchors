functional relationships within genomic datasets important computational analysis data
although many methods both been developed problem networks interactions most relevant given input data still remains open issue
here method random graphs network components based experimental data well local network connectivity
using method distribution values associated each interaction network interactions based experimental data
show analyses genomic data more accurate using than some methods
also present analysis gene expression data cells different pattern network cell cycle
our analyses demonstrate use genomic data
introduction
important analyses high datasets integration data prior knowledge interactions measured molecules most relevant networks
approach data within context known functional interactions between biological molecules leads hypothesis
typically procedure would identification genes data values then identification associated networks
however most relevant biological associated lower end data distribution not task because biological pathway do not usually similar data values use various computational algorithms finding networks genes
one class methods finding relevant networks optimization finding genes based data values genes
although approach likely result highly relevant networks therefore not analyses functional data
most popular existing methods relevant networks genomic data however usually involve network strategy using focus gene set typically set genes most significant data values
network other nodes network either based interactions focus set based analysis between focus genes
both methods aim at genes network most central focus genes each other
problems associated methods been previously
however most central genes identified methods may data values focus genes data values nodes not during network process using gene
may result networks not networks most significantly represented genomic data
addition methods do not account genes more data values may more important than those more data values
although data analysis methods finding sets genes significant expression changes been developed approach not been into methods interaction networks most data
order problems method random graphs interactions network data
method random been structural analyses networks account local well global structure within network very useful most nodes
here instead set focus genes data distribution network bias random probabilities based data values associated nodes
method distribution values each interaction network then used network further statistical analyses
here describe concept demonstrate its relevant networks compared pathway analysis show use results comparative analyses networks between different conditions
tested experimentally derived genomic data cancer cells different used agent
using identify several previously network processes involved cell
studies propose network based analysis biological high data prior knowledge networks define genes way
use will analysis genomic data
