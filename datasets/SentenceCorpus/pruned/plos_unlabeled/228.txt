genes percent genes genome
genes represent genetic but little known evolutionary their
here compare evolution between two genomes years
two genomes similar number including genes number genes within number relative single genes regions
analysis rates along positive correlation between rate found
also relative genes
both genomes genes membrane proteins function but genes involved transcription dna rna binding functions
observations evolutionary involves genes either at end biochemical pathways pathway number affect genes
despite differences distribution between similar mechanisms
introduction
genomes contain events
example there been at least three events most recent years
regions percent their genes pairs having one
process gene loss respect function because genes functions related transcription signal development
like also history up percent genome events up percent genes
although there been studies identify genes via one important source genomes not been studied genes
gene family they genomes
almost many genes those events
they also represent functional component genome genes secondary disease genes regulatory genes
evolution been studied
regions relative genes their relative genes correlated rates along
evolutionary processes correlation
correlation could via processes could produced among selection gene gain gene loss
also whether other genomes
also likely differ gene their process
close physical gene recently demonstrated both yeast
one practical distance between cannot used time event two genes
instead provides into either event gene events
study values among genes could
genome sequence provides first compare structure evolution between two genomes
two species years but similar they relatively small genomes
genomic analyses sequence revealed some properties between percent percent genes genes relatively low values
not been studied comparative context context genomic features
paper address several basic questions about evolution function
first does number distribution differ between
second more high regions they
third do two species exhibit clear differences distribution among
do genes represent functional biases relative genes
finally any general mechanisms differences between distribution genomes
