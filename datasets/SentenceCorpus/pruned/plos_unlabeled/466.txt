introduction
complete genome sequencing model organisms provided required studies gene function
data nature genes proteins their interactions cell now been generated techniques including but not limited gene analysis yeast rna
functional approaches when combined computational biology systems biology finally allow us cellular molecular networks pathways
one main how best data sources use them better understand biological systems health disease
analysis biological data networks important approach explore wide variety biological relationships
approaches been used study sequence similarity protein structure protein interactions evolution
biological data into allows one use algorithms techniques statistics previously developed graph theory computer computational systems biology
classical graph theory graph network nodes
biological networks nodes usually genes proteins while tend represent experimentally determined functional between them
analysis techniques generally where individual relationship between two biological studied without interactions their
graph network analysis techniques allow position biological context its local graph network whole
another important advantage techniques datasets tend not form structure graph but instead although may not case data generated techniques biases
because many network analysis techniques local structure networks between related nodes they far less noise may approaches
one example network analysis clustering protein protein similarity interaction networks
techniques graph clustering well allows discovery novel aspects biological function
techniques hence provide into both local features networks also global features network
although network analysis biological data shown little attention been gene expression data
data now generally high quality type data approaches
principle gene expression data into network graph few
similarity between individual expression may determined one number possible statistical techniques correlation
networks based arbitrary correlation threshold
indeed number groups previously apply network data relationships between genes based correlation expression
while studies suggested power approach tools their limited their approaches general application
describe development application new network analysis clustering analysis gene expression data
specifically research gene expression demonstrate approach
data was generated so provide analysis across wide range normal cell types
one most complete studies expression
however common other large datasets analysis data significant
certain genes known only expressed single cell type at specific times during development response stimuli
others thought expressed all cells at about same level
between two there many other genes expressed most number cell types but whose transcription may give specific temporal spatial pattern expression
also known genes play distinct common pathway biological process often expressed similar they
hence when genes found expression may genes functional
better understand aspects gene regulation functional role proteins explore utility network analysis explore structure
demonstrate approach clusters genes similar network connectivity relationships between clusters statistical analysis functional
