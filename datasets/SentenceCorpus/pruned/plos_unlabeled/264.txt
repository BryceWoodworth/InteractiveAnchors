introduction

one same disease may differ both their their like
different same called
if several exist population they each other two ways
first type interaction may
many one disease population
because system upon first so second may population at
place even between
second type interaction specific different same full each other
means one less certain other time after initial
between similar
since similarity usually recent common thus its evolution
understanding dynamics at general theoretical level out difficult
models been proposed during past years
although models many they differ often resulting model predictions
there little how best gain into evolution
models either
agent models recently become due increase computational
since models however not designed do not type model here
all models disease dynamics model introduced
models also known models into individuals
problem when classical framework multiple number state variables typically also parameters increases number
not only computational but also attention fundamental even large number number state variables any population size
most model therefore few individuals if they at effects must then not
existing approaches modeling reduce number model
usually only under certain sets assumptions may may not depending phenomenon
thus important set assumptions under reduced models
our work presented here goal
full models been developed based assumption reduced able certain probability
other hand all existing reduced models rely assumption reduced all not same probability but those become less than those who do not
most likely between two
discuss model section reduced assumption seems more
study develop reduction approach applied under either assumptions models without
our approach existing ones models approximate full models degree accuracy
number variables needed resulting number n rather than when n large difference between n 2 2 n much more than latter
if reduced assumed our approach model
utility our approach reduced models general demonstrate its application phenomenon using reduced models able up
whose evolution interaction pattern
because human system produce against individuals gain against each they been
results complex human population according individuals different
selection thought evolution process known
shown space
et al first two most important
moreover follows results et al temporal evolution along single space clusters corresponding different years well along first dimension
observation tree single
other words even though genetic during each only one
number does not
few recent studies model explain phenomenon models most studies consider space some behavior observed
evolution one dimension space been necessary require space was relatively region along one
recent study et al different approach sequence space
authors explicitly showed may network structure space
however open question properties space sufficient its evolution
et al suggest one
they argue distinct may intrinsic feature dynamics limited set types always present population thus genetic evolution
here suggest alternative follows more view genetic evolution
however problem instead assume relatively simple structure space
our model what could space order long
our work thus et al
our space each changes local region system
then investigate response depends two full against all previous
respect our model related models studied
show evolutionary our model follows even though space
finding observed
