introduction
proteins molecular conformational changes while out their function
however over past few years become clear much more complex there proteins simply do not defined structure yet still out different important functions
disordered proteins protein also called disordered difficult study using classical methods structural biology but they recent years significant attention due two
first become clear proteins
using approaches been shown about percent all proteins disordered about percent long
among signaling proteins particular about percent long disordered
numbers even if some predicted disordered regions actually prove likely far example population membrane proteins
second factor fact involved important cellular functions molecular recognition protein functions
example complex cellular cell signaling regulation often required actions many key molecular through interaction recognition based unique features case signaling proteins often regions
when recognition multiple binding binding required choice molecular level often involves regions
finally large numbers known involved human cancer
thus far some study been through data approaches
been shown sequences tend exhibit high low sequence entropy lack amino residues
based features several tools been developed predict level intrinsic given sequence
moreover using different methods basic structural features been including their molecular size level structural role structure events presence structure
particular combination computer simulation provided some first
however compared our knowledge structure mechanism proteins our understanding still because their structural dynamic complexity
present study use molecular dynamics simulations free energy focus role
d
family
characterized ability high
example more than dna no effect its
however molecular mechanisms underlying high d thought effect mechanisms environments
over years evidence there exists no single mechanism nature d but rather combination different mechanisms at play
range structural increased genome number high concentration active mechanisms including base dna
however important mechanisms may also possible major structural order environmental
one potential strategy address compare d those its differences
recently one us taken approach focused presence biological role regions d
subset proteins d was identified contain highly low sequence complexity intrinsic
proteins including dna proteins
further finding here focus analyze properties its regions
large class present all organisms wide range including
some family way potentially effects would if into
other family concentration metabolic signaling molecules
d different types about three times more than what would expected given size its genome number per any genome known
particular been reported d genes strongly during phase been metabolic
regions dynamic very difficult study
however computer simulations molecular dynamics techniques provide complete dynamic
here using sequence analysis methods molecular dynamics simulations free energy show regions protein significantly its properties making whole protein significantly more
fact functional role regions they key functional under conditions
