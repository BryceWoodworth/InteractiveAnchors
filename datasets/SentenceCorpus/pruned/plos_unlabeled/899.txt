natural proteins often several highly specific interactions
they thus subject multiple during evolutionary selection
functional proteins need stable complex each interaction at same time all
how through natural evolution
answer question study protein target proteins
structures computational methods predict sequences best interaction each individual target
then design sequences most each possible combination two three all targets almost low energy sequences
comparing sequences their gain into how nature find between need interaction need
more sequences better natural sequence thus importance strategies nature
furthermore show binding into critical all those provide interaction
several basic necessary protein
also between interaction find interactions requires only small optimal
proteins been optimization process their sequences interactions set targets thus their multiple cellular functions
introduction
proteins interactions together outcome all biological processes cell
some estimates over third all proteins two more highly specific interactions
proteins large number play central role protein interaction networks
proteins usually protein tend more essential than others cell usually exhibit rates evolution
moreover biological activity proteins typically requires them set targets specific way
example each g protein only specific subset g proteins
proteins binding also been proteins
central function proteins within interaction networks constraints their amino sequences especially their regions used interactions various targets
there exist only few studies characterized molecular structural features protein due sparse representation protein data
understanding interactions important not only basic but also design new interactions
furthermore molecular will provide critical feedback systems biology research interactions network approach
protein more than three targets identified
central formula signaling pathways control gene transcription protein
formula protein changes formula concentration into activity many targets including
targets sequence structure
regions within target proteins generally residues
no sequence exists all target proteins
recent structural studies revealed there several binding protein its targets state formula state state
form usually formula amino upon interaction protein
binding conformational change target its two domains area interactions target
its targets high formula values formula formula range
reduced at least formula its targets when formula
binding constraints during evolution likely produced sequence may not optimal binding any particular target but rather essential interaction large number
study computational design approach understand how required functional both level amino sequences level binding
first single second protein multiple
recently similar analysis was performed proteins whose interactions two targets were considered
contrast those report much more single protein
examine interactions different exhibit binding
using structures perform design obtain formula low energy sequences optimal either single target some combination targets
quantitative statistical designed sequences their allows us evolution suggest strategies design both yet highly specific
particular binding its residues into those critical binding those important
furthermore analyze sequence required proteins interactions show how past ability many targets
finally examine find our results also findings previous experimental protein design research
