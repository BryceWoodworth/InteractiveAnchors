introduction
our understanding molecular basis wide range biological processes including development disease significantly recent years
not single genes but rather complex networks genes gene other cellular elements cellular cell when lead development disease
complex networks elements significant
one approach applied representation changes occur state space defined expression states all genes within cell
approach number including framework predictive modeling stochastic components biological process
underlying assumption analysis each cellular particular class gene expression specific region gene expression state space
described et al particular cellular state at particular time represented gene expression vector high space where each expression level particular gene
all possible take expression state space
each observed represented single point state space
when cells transition through example during different specific sets genes their expression levels underlying program changes represented continuous expression state represent program being out gene networks complex pathways
first proposed idea stable cell cellular expression state space stable points system would if small
points out principle cells could any gene expression states however not what nature
according since there about different cell types there must number state space either represent stable cell cell types cells will presence
while model direct experimental evidence its overall utility cellular mechanism seen
et al reported evidence they demonstrated existence
they gene expression experiment human cells into using two different
data was using provide gene expression level measures necessary model
using components analysis they develop state space representation over time common leading expression state
they argue instead explore state space convergence single point therefore provides empirical states exist nature
here propose alternative behavior does not hypothesis but rather observation context components pathways applied
end work et al state space into components two sets genes core group group effects
components observation both sources effects influence overall taken during cell transition
show how allows us at functional behavior genes their cell more way
using regression models core genes common both stimuli represent those critical process
genes core represent component corresponding effects
our apply our method same generated et al
cell long been used model understand molecular mechanisms
normal processes
however cells result cells
discovery like could cells class known
but also functions agent cell
although widely used treatment not generally used humans because known
class molecules called
used human patients
current complete rates patients combination been reported high percent
at molecular level both cell cycle at phase transition point cells resulting cells
distinct molecules different sets pathways cells
et al explain why explore different expression state space
they argue presence then different at common specific unique pathway may both
while may upon further hypothesis our ability develop predictive models cell
there exists alternative more et al not considered
our based recognition there two types processes cell one core biological process event two process related direct effects particular agent cell
early seen state space described et al response specific response follows
processes only at initial since most cell
effects each expected core processes occurs both become more more because pathways cells cells larger cells transition towards their common
source convergence therefore not due existence but instead combination two types processes their temporal effects cells
indeed if then there should whole class would initial state rather than small number single core pathway
if one hypothesis basis then our much state space through existence defined between states
