because generally not good approximation real world situations current models approach both information about disease relevant transmission network
models their assumptions attention computational their application
models consider different contact patterns them via contact matrix but often representation
models consider distribution each number formula transmission network
models allow study transmission networks strong number among individuals some cases also means they consider way made clustering
although approaches focus networks recent approach networks arbitrary degree distributions allows temporal evolution number nodes set
finally pair models very general approach networks
they provide large amount way made but they become very
assumption often made models through population at much time scales than time scale processes natural processes

case study focus disease lead after individuals after several disease
addition work our approach also allows study between structure dynamics underlying transmission network
all approaches discussed only predict mean behavior within limit population
however our finite size simulations show good efficient approximation population
