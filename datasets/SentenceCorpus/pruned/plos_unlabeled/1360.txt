experimental structure at however
computational methods structure prediction particularly yet their limited receptor them not predicting if large conformational changes receptor upon binding involved
accurate receptor models state however drug design
hence if only structure available distinct drug design limited
present method predict structure based structure structure
method applied cases proteins structural up upon binding
all cases receptor models within target were predicted binding were obtained cases complex models
presented expected structure modeling drug design cases where structures not available
introduction
interactions between proteins small molecules involved many biochemical
into processes detailed knowledge about structure how close
moreover almost all
receptor complex structures critical understanding biological function structure based drug design
however structure difficult
structures usually obtained either common problem even when conditions well might not complex
particularly conformational receptor associated binding structure
when structures protein not available drug design highly
several studies showed usually results factor compared even when structural difference between both small
therefore development at certain degree receptor either using structures instead single receptor modeling certain structure also small
receptor molecular been shown both factors ability predict correct binding particularly cases when receptor structure been different usually case when novel
however degree thus far limited either small thus highly similar drug design
particularly conformational transition upon binding structure based drug design
although might not several experimental techniques exist conformational changes
many cases where proteins domain upon binding they different bound state corresponding change studied either where more correlation time
provide information modeling structures well into protein dynamics
here present method predict structure proteins large conformational change upon binding
requires known experimental data
here apply information more than structure
developed simulation conformational sampling molecular dynamics simulations applied proteins
cases where both bound known order able predicted receptor
conformational changes involved range binding site differ between
cases predict receptor close cases predict binding close state our method predictions involving large conformational
