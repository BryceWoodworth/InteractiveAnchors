introduction
response input signals neurons pathway typically frequency formula particular response
at least cases formula responses often phase field often used describe properties
function formula sensitivity at response formula frequency formula given stimulus
more specifically stimulus power formula input at frequency formula at time formula average level formula
if let formula response at time formula then formula best linear relationship between formula formula stimulus paper formula input although some authors also include average input power formula
though formula not full description input since features phase only relevant input far
note if use formula neural response its activity level then both formula formula mean
will use paper
studies temporal dimension called field
1
regions its frequency response
example if formula at frequency formula time formula then frequency formula should input formula frequency formula
will also formula field kernel function input neural responses all same similar
typically estimated using correlation methods
however there signal along pathway
indeed neural responses though linear power function
there two when represented
one formula when applied linear approximation formula better predictions neural responses
however does not seen linear
paper more complex dependent stimulus used estimate them
example when stimuli rather than when stimuli rather than noise
also more when increases
stimulus example type neurons field region
system become further
despite concept still widely used not only because provides description neurons given stimulus but also because predict neural responses novel stimuli well long stimuli same stimulus used estimate first place
predictions been obtained responses neurons
they also been obtained responses neurons when stimulus more dynamic
if linear neural include performed also possible predict sources neurons based linear neural input
linear models many complex particularly not limited being just
been suggested some neurons process objects highly manner object component while components same region frequency space object components some low over high contrast
strong processes long since models responses
paper understand computational rather than perspective why should depend stimulus ways observed
more specifically paper cases neural responses identify understand computational goal given stimulus finding metric according optimal
would provide how measured should depend stimulus
paper does not address what linear mechanisms could optimal whether how processes adaptation stimulus
existing computational models neurons including ones notion cells perform independent component analysis provide efficient using cannot explain observed stimulus
attention temporal properties observed temporal level noise input environment
particular temporal field being being low increase noise
they using simple model adaptation more efficient input information
study efficient understand its other input characteristics
work understand temporal characteristics adaptation changes noise signal input statistics
explicitly principle efficient states neural should neural responses much information possible central system subject neural cost information
principle been proposed applied visual system understand early visual pathway
will techniques derive explain results paper
make initial necessary some assumptions
first assume statistical characteristics stimulus do not change more than at so stimulus being far optimal
when assumption does not us when not optimal when one before visual change
second mathematical assume linear model approximate neural responses well
know above assumption often does not particularly neurons
paper optimal cases future studies
third derive solution optimal assume input statistics stimulus being higher order input only representation original
although known natural far case may only limited impact input measured amount information original input
understand how should increase visual made
large data about visual world
however input data visual via only smaller data rate
thus been proposed early visual processes use efficient strategy much information possible given limited other words data data reduced data limited
possible since very strong between visual at points time space
data rate
one way input formula into different representation formula neural responses would then much smaller data rate than formula yet essential input information
often visual field
instance cells help spatial
they do making cells spatial contrast input so responses visual whose input their
responses cells much less correlated than those making their representation much more efficient
one efficient hypothesis optimal field should depend statistical properties correlation structure input
been used explain adaptation changes input statistics visual field characteristics regions neurons properties neurons
system information also reduced along pathway
although reduction was only investigated neural responses rather than leading neural responses suggested one early processes
more efficient
input contains signal formula noise formula
input formula linear function formula into also contains additional noise formula introduced process
when input multiple many different cells formula vector many components indeed formula
output formula vector neural population responses many neurons
output formula formula
therefore formula matrix its formula formula models field output formula effective weights input formula output formula
particular example when input neurons output neurons cells formula effective formula cell formula formula describe linear field cell
consider problem finding optimal formula information formula about formula information formula between formula formula subject given cost neural depends responses way will describe
therefore optimal formula should objective formula parameter whose value particular between information
neural various sources metabolic energy cost neural cost higher rates neural firing
been model neural cost formula average over stimulus
been shown formula provides most efficient according formula following properties
at high formula formula difference between correlated thus information
hence example conditions cells spatial spatial contrast input
contrast at low formula out input noise instead
neural cost noise
hence example conditions when considered being low cells their regions their
will apply framework understand their adaptation stimulus
