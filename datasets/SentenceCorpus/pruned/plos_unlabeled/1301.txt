yeast environmental
through regulation both gene expression protein activity various physiological
evolutionary specific gene expression adaptive response each environmental change
although some specific likely others common various situations
evolutionary might properties proteins whose gene expression during adaptive responses
test hypothesis analyze existing yeast data responses investigate how several properties proteins changes gene expression
our results consistent protein during adaptive response yeast various types
two groups adaptive responses respect how cells protein
one group significant towards large proteins small ones observed
other group find no
results consistent being important evolution first group responses
introduction
organisms environmental
their against changes adaptive response involving at different cellular levels
appropriate adaptive responses require signaling changes activity proteins changes transcription genes etc
many cellular any adaptive response due need new protein while other protein not required new conditions
changes mechanisms processes allow cell function under environments
various functional physiological constraints
functional result specific cell environment
other hand physiological constraints defined within cell activity its component functional
global point view adaptive responses seen problem because cells appropriate responses different types while different its each those responses
example cells increase concentration specific proteins while concentration other components increase concentration
increase could cell increase levels
other functional constraints likely provide evolutionary specific gene expression leads adaptive responses
thus important identify functional quantitative physiological constraints may significantly adaptive responses
among others important role cells
several consistent metabolic cost been identified properties set proteins expressed when cells
example genes proteins highly under conditions pattern well relative yeast s
another found genes highly expressed under conditions sequence bias
metabolic cost further observed relative amino proteins under same conditions
proteins amino
example general bias long genes
bias probability errors reduced during
biases suggest overall possible may significantly increase cellular
view consistent observation small changes gene expression levels protein influence specific e
body results strongly notion metabolic cost properties cells environmental
thus one might if metabolic cost also important factor evolution adaptive responses conditions
evolutionary might adaptive responses require use higher cell adaptation
three cases been reported due high energy
given protein one cell metabolic cost might properties proteins whose expression change during adaptation
therefore here following questions
there consistent metabolic cost proteins during adaptive responses
one find general properties proteins expression patterns genes involved adaptive response different environmental
if so what physiological constraints consistent those
address questions how value several properties proteins related changes gene expression levels during various environmental changes
find genes whose expression during different types adaptive responses tend proteins small while genes whose expression during same responses tend proteins large
consistent metabolic cost proteins
more significant adaptive responses where changes gene expression levels affect large genome
our knowledge first general global been identified properties proteins involved adaptive responses
