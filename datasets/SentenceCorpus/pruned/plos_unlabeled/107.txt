evolutionary game theoretical model selection show natural selection mutation lead robust simple social norm call
under good individual help individual leads good whereas help good individual one leads
strategies direct lack where idea often associated evolutionary
introduction
many biological systems interactions their
humans other species form large social groups among
general assumption strong individuals ones who most natural selection
being case how possible evolution
resulting work if b another individual cost c
context several mechanisms been explain evolution but only recently evolutionary model been developed unique aspects human
means had been investigated context
more recently many studies been how under
indeed according provides mechanism us humans all other species
moreover recently may provided human evolution
game any two at most each other one role potential other potential help
each experience many but same direct being
another individual given may increase may change others help future interactions
however new depends social norm used action
previous studies models recently among other factors actions based require cognitive even when individuals making binary only world assumed most recent studies
furthermore stable information
high cognitive interactions also rely mechanisms
indeed interactions between individuals usually moral
introduced via feedback mechanism
despite high levels observed been found detailed account feedback history does not improve compared only most recent
other words practice shows simple mechanisms high levels
view previous explain basis results obtained so far context
let us consider world set each under influence single norm common all individuals
each individual game all other
action will depend individual strategy whether will provide help do depending
means result every interaction made available through observation model introduced
allows any individual know current without all past interactions
other hand requires way information population
seems important although recent mechanisms rely
since either good there 2 possible strategies
other hand number possible depends their associated order
all action taken
one also new
so increasing complexity shown 2 features those here
any individual same norm turn question how each
do not address issue here
however associated one may assume through process
moreover likely common norm overall
however if were different different individuals observation model would not requires judgments made
norm order n there possible each associated binary length 2 n consider new make judgment involving action well previous action
introduce following evolutionary dynamics each during one all individuals each other via game
when individuals they their strategy another individual same chosen payoff
most individuals each higher
since different under influence different overall each will well strategies each
individual selection each
small probability associated selection between
after each norm will change norm detailed methods section
consider different between different types selection group selection based average global payoff each well selection resulting terms games game extended game
perform computer simulations evolutionary dynamics sets each
information statistical analysis
frequency 1 each
if its frequency percent
no occurs instead 1
analyze simulations same value b frequency 1 1
if 1 if 1 assume
our procedure though provides simple means biological evolution where genes complex networks yet
process would more appropriate will future work
