key involved higher pairs large small
current evidence two types play distinct function
recently structure been
current study applied molecular area method identified critical amino each other during structure formation
further shown role amino interaction yeast
comparison computational results experiments energy residues more important critical residues
found interaction much than one interactions
study will not only our understanding interaction between but will also us proteins obtain better used
introduction
key regulatory involved higher
rate reaction pathway using 2
regulation almost all depends
while functions main activity
pairs small large structure
two two distinct genes
sequence between different percent common gene
molecular weights range depending species
specifically molecular weights
was found different
was shown both regulatory functions whereas properties
results were also studies showed was into active structure whereas was able form properties
however showed properties terms regulation
required higher activation was more
results suggested was essential function
recent studies may
binding may allow binding turn influence
addition specific regions both were found important stability
also using small et al found critical interaction
they region between residues directly significantly overall stability
recently structure was found form et al
structure been yet
due difficulty stable form
however critical structure identify key residues taking place interactions obtain more detailed
understanding structure residues will us stable form
approach been shown previously
structure proposed model
study extended our previous work our model identify important residues interactions between both computational experimental techniques
based molecular area method two distinct domains involved interaction
residues his involved interaction whereas residues involved interaction
effect mutations interactions were further characterized using yeast methods
also experimental results g binding energy amino parameter interaction rather than g binding total g binding
study will important structural aspects structure provide further more functional form
