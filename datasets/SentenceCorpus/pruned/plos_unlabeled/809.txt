length dependent make up were found two efficient work

introduction
fundamental whole phenomenon cellular mechanisms
each generate
local cellular scale into global whole resulting effective efficient system level function
fundamental efficient work integration cellular scale mechanisms
however while important role relative importance underlying mechanisms efficient work cell remains
structural metabolic neural mechanisms provide stable physiological framework resulting
however over time scales cellular mechanisms most likely dynamic variation
specifically themselves contain feedback mechanisms development active based local rate
provide regulatory process signals cell into global response
four major mechanisms length dependent changes 2 sensitivity dependent binding 2 c dependent
mechanisms 1 2 length dependent changes state 2 relationship described
length dependent changes measured concentration 2 required produce activation increases length
length dependent changes result active increasing increases length
2 binding
generate they increase 2 more 2 results more
described stable component
component response step changes length stable component during at constant
general increases active
four mechanisms provide both positive negative feedback development fundamental yet their relative if any not been investigated
part due experimental function whole whole simulations
recent computer power methods now allow simulation strongly models
models contain cellular 2 dynamics multiple feedback between each systems
study local cellular scale work into whole work using computational
using positive negative work propose new metric during each phase cycle positive work total work
role cellular work into whole function over developed model at mechanisms
model contains model
comparing over each phase each mechanisms aim effect each mechanisms
