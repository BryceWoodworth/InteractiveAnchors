typically only parameters experimentally measured while often
process usually based experimental time measurements used parameter values some measure error between measurements corresponding model prediction
measurements etc tend very taken at limited number time points
work present new approach problem parameter selection biological models
show how one use dynamic known extended at estimates model parameters
proposed method follows
first use variation particularly well biological applications obtain first unknown parameters
test estimates
finally solve optimization problem first case should not accurate
estimates consistent measurements
furthermore show how same tools used among models same biological process

introduction
many biological processes using describe evolution over time certain interest
at molecular level variables considered models often represent species proteins
pathway structure known corresponding relatively using widely action
general will depend several parameters
some them reaction rates physical
others might structure system therefore they might no direct biological biochemical
both cases most parameters unknown
while measure them experimentally many cases very time even
however usually possible measure some other variables involved models using like
problem parameter estimation unknown parameters measurements other key issue computational systems biology
knowledge parameter values one obtain quantitative even information models
years attention been given problem systems biology
much research been applications computational biology models several optimization techniques linear genetic algorithms evolutionary
latter suggested method choice large parameter estimation problems
initial optimization methods search more less parameter space certain cost function
usually defined error some sense between output model data experiments
result set parameters produce best between simulations experimental data
one main problems associated optimization methods they tend may not perform well if noise measurements significant
also been bayesian methods information data
both noise intrinsic noise well known play important role when species present low numbers
main advantage methods their ability whole probability distributions parameters rather than just point estimate
also they estimation stochastic systems no algorithms
main their application computational since approaches not problems numerical solutions also due need solve integration problems
most recent bayesian markov techniques methods sequential methods require been applied biological systems usually case problems relatively high number data samples
estimation also been applied
more recently parameter estimation computational biology models been framework control theory using state
algorithms were developed problem state estimation one estimate time evolution components state system
literature subject but context biological biochemical systems used approaches include based
other methods been developed special structure specific problems
state parameter estimation using technique state parameters into states system under study
context extended methods been applied well
when number unknown parameters very large often find unique solution problem
case one several sets parameters values all likely give good
situation usually model being one most practice
furthermore known large class systems biology models parameter values distributed over many
been suggested factor makes parameter estimation difficult
similar results search exact individual values parameters task most cases
however also known even if estimation process not able any parameter values models still able significant quantitative predictions
present results parameter estimation procedure applied large parameter sparse data provides evaluation statistical estimates
achieve goal introduce extended algorithm together measure accuracy estimation process based formula test
furthermore show how techniques together also used address problem model selection one most model given process among
feature approach ability use information about statistics noise order estimated parameters consistent available experimental data
paper follows
methods section introduce all theory associated our procedure extended accuracy measure its use estimation application model selection problem
results section demonstrate procedure two examples molecular biology
finally section new procedure give some additional point out how findings will interest researchers computational biology who use experimental data construct models biological
