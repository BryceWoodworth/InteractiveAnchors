computational identification functional will novel health genetic explain human evolution
however development evaluation techniques been limited known regulatory
address literature set regulatory within database
further used regulatory set unknown function regions genes investigate potential properties related gene regulation population
among most important properties region distance transcription site local sequence derived presence
further used set properties evaluate their performance regulatory
using approach were able achieve sensitivity show performance strongly distance transcription site
introduction
our ability identify molecular mechanisms specific genetic within our population will our ability each genome
recent sequencing allow increasing number number sources variation their each
new identified each molecular into our past present future each our genetic our common evolution potential predict disease drug system practice
however our ability far our ability them
more than unique version only very small been associated using genetic analysis
because studies dependent frequency population
furthermore many not expected function
functional computational methods been developed identify structure genes
types computational methods tend functional those amino sequence within regions functional protein domains biochemical structure protein
however very few methods identify regulatory expression genes
been several human including cancer transmission response type 1
work techniques identify particular class functional within core regions human genes
computational approaches classification differences transcription factor weight matrices
within matrix high information assumed more likely functional
support hypothesis however been examples
furthermore recent study significant weight matrix signals percent regulatory
however hypothesis computational regulatory prediction been predictions using application approaches
technique using between human was demonstrated show significant differences predictions also demonstrated differences
however only two had effect gene
also been demonstrated function study regulatory database where experimentally regulatory were conserved binding sites
strategies functional been characterized regulatory
few studies identified after identified
address problem available functional regulatory within database
examined several features they unknown function within regions associated genes
our hypothesis using combination regulatory population properties individual properties significant function chosen
within our set found best distance transcription site local density sequence frequency derived frequency presence
application approach demonstrated one least effective
used their properties support vector machine classifier
two approaches were used one properties all were compared all one each property value positive within associated gene were compared average values each property within gene
all approach designed determine if there any properties important across test set while group approach designed determine if there important values within may functional
test value all analysis group analysis
