introduction
temporal constraints major models object recognition
when two human subjects make where there target little
if allow system underlying visual processing less
recent showed over time small only about after stimulus contain accurate information about nature visual stimulus
processing depends ability visual system learn visual manner
how learning occurs major theoretical
here simple network two key features
first when visual stimulus neurons various system most strongly neurons firing first mechanism been shown image information
second neurons at later system dependent known effect high synaptic weights early
demonstrate when system presented natural neurons will become patterns present input while their leading both fast responses
process occurs way but then show features able support
our network family networks
its model object recognition model itself well natural
like them model increasing complexity observed along pathway use simple cells gain their linear while complex cells gain
our network does not only rely uses neurons temporal domain
at each time first respect stimulus key variable variable contains information indeed out neurons
when presented image first cells simple cells four more strongly cell
response stimulus contrast between stimulus
been shown how cells so our model cells
also limit number at between cells through at given corresponding one only corresponding best matching
note mechanisms temporal domain using
then through network neurons
note within framework maximum complex cells simply first given group
low threshold synaptic all neurons group
one one limit activity at most one per only initial
before new image every potential
process various input image
there one pathway each processing scale
results cells various field
then cells take maximum response cells over all scales leading position scale responses
paper how set synaptic leading visual features whose brain may
learning rule function temporal between before one whereas its other way
amount depends delay between two when close together effects few
note because neurons before those part firing
here used rule where weight does not depend delay between time whole
also use 1 bounds
several authors studied effect
here demonstrate ability statistical terms firing patterns within visual despite their very high natural
visual stimuli presented resulting through where used
use
random weight matrix present first visual stimuli
cells all each other
if no cell its threshold process next image
each first its threshold
mechanism other cells firing
thus rule
its weight matrix change weights at all scales
allows system learn patterns despite changes position size training examples
also use local between different when cell at given position scale all other cells firing later at same scale within firing position
only used learning phase all cells learning same pattern
instead cell population each cell learn distinct pattern so whole
if stimuli visual features common process will them
some cells will convergence synaptic weights end up being either close 1
during convergence process control
those through true even presence activity
preference key point since our framework most regions image been shown most
during learning
after convergence responses become visual features complexity similar features used work
features now defined clusters among
statistical among one each distinct pattern
