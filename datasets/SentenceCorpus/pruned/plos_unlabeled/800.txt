introduction
many proteins assume more than one functional binding changes environmental conditions
example widely studied molecular machine protein family
proteins
two each
each turn three domains
together
activity complex series structure binding described binding both assume state state two
binding molecules one conformational change open state thus leading form
form number residues at domains
groups following
provides energy needed process leads state process upon binding molecules hence term negative effect binding
structure molecules bound molecules new cycle time being
interest understand molecular basis negative effect upon binding molecules
binding case structural change region at distance
understanding mechanism signaling fundamental importance because critical role play events
several studies been pathways dynamics since original complex
studies provide into states involved cycle
transition mechanisms been however both experimentally due nature high energy between states pathways large size system
several computational methods been developed two structural transition pathways
include methods based stochastic integration method maximum method reaction action
other groups molecular dynamics simulations presence constraints methods sampling stochastic transition
yet identification transition state conformational large systems order like
models methods appear only tools cases
most computational study dynamics where t transition been examined dynamics simulations using model
simulations performed provided transition pathways at t
