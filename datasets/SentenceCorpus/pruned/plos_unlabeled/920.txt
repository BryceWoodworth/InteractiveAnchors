proteins at one site resulting functional change at second site
communication proteins upon networks
argue networks necessary communication
algorithm between active structures networks
then networks representation contact form global communication networks
communication among all sites proteins while networks exhibit communication only proteins
furthermore proteins percent more via do not exist via either network
pathways typically not linear but rather networks clusters
results argue communication based structural changes demonstrate utility
global communication networks may variety experiments proteins well design into proteins
introduction
concept models et al et al account based upon properties transition between two
more recent models population conformational more there experimental evidence states solution
individual molecules properties proteins
individual molecules pathways structural changes dynamic must sites
structures revealed most proteins complex systems both structural changes
previously communication through structure graphs form transition between active state structures
network protein structure between residues space identified
networks contact networks identified proteins tested changes play significant but role communication
work approach more mechanisms structure
specifically develop network representation structural changes representation
information about mechanism properties differences between active structures
our work approaches but mechanism order events transition between active structural
most current computational approaches protein dynamics predict associated structure theoretical models like network potential functions
while predictions address important problems most approaches do not predict pathways
contrast problems will argue pathway identification network representation protein structural transition
network protein structures previously been used dynamic properties
example predicted normal analysis network known conformational changes
addition regions protein structures been predicted network contact constraints single protein structure
furthermore residues important short contact network experimentally known signaling proteins
however communication pathways not previously been derived network representation structural transition
paper develop hypothesis via networks
differences between active structures algorithm form network based between them
representation communication mechanisms how communication through networks through contact networks structure
then networks representation form global communication networks
describe range several proteins set then communication via network proteins each protein based connectivity
analysis provides theory proteins may drug design experiments simulations
