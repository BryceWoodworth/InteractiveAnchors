introduction
protein transcription factor signaling pathways involved decisions
sufficient leads activation d dependent
results dna cell cycle
however when cells under growth factors
finally also cell growth genes cellular metabolic including factors proteins
given its importance activity must response different environmental cues
past studies suggested at multiple levels including transcription regulation
more recent also at protein level pathways
suggest protein series sequential
more specifically when highly
when at activity
at however process sequential manner
mechanism protein
at changes required
only mechanism identified processes
pathway
unique control dynamics sequential allows signals play critical cell
often early activation upon growth
depend cell growth factors
critical signal
example cells small activity result growth factor leads
contrast high activity result growth factor same cell leads
level also been observed critical level
activation pattern depends cell detailed
various cell including when growth factors
contrast only early single cell other growth
activation been shown important cell cycle regulation
particular second been found sufficient critical transition during cell cycle
temporal pattern activation those
protein its at 2 after growth remains at value over before its level
2
observations suggest may sense signals its two
gain into control mechanism mathematical model analyze dynamics sequential
using model investigate how signaling patterns dynamics at level
also how robust dynamics respect network parameters rate
what unique about strategy protein stability
common strategy cells achieve temporal control key regulatory proteins
questions our work may provide into design features cell signaling networks experimental
our model unique other models signaling dynamics leading activation well dynamics leading cell decisions further propose regulation example
appropriate parameters will temporal input signals
