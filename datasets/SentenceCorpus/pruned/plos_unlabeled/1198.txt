selection should genes secondary because their reduced
test hypothesis selected genomes multiple two evolutionary rates all within each
both evolutionary rate parameters were among found secondary than those primary
further every genome multiple studied genes secondary significantly bias than those primary
evolution reduced bias could turn result global effects position genes secondary experience reduced expression due their selection specific gene attributes
alternatives were using common genomes multiple genomes single
analysis sets suggested genes tend secondary when they however evolution secondary further rates
secondary evolutionary test where genes more likely because they used less
introduction
number genomes discovery multiple become
setting issue why some genomes into multiple large others only single dna unknown
understanding secondary question
may three different single large essential genes its
processes support because some secondary
however potential effects genome require further may explain variation number evolution
one advantage genome potential growth because multiple dna
example
two among rates cell measured
yet all single per means growth may occur than problem ability new before previous
result cells may multiple genomes
multiple additional if different either their their rates must
been demonstrated smaller second during cell cycle
effect genes second during growth but does not each
each cell one only one each no evidence yet suggests
therefore variation how not at least given current knowledge effect variation their effective numbers
however variation gene during cell cycle effects expression genes well their evolutionary rates
single genes tend expressed less than those thus genes more
multiple smaller could produce similar effect its expression thus its evolution
recent report effect expression genes small expressed significantly less than those large though expression more than would expected measured effects
cells hence no expression bias found between
bias within genomes could therefore evolution secondary
variation expression genome either relative different principle selection gene position
genes must expressed should primary
therefore follows significantly greater genes found large primary than small relative large even large relative small
when under optimal conditions bias genes hence their expression but under more conditions bias expression do not gene position
moreover growth rate significantly when rate second
findings selection genomes contain genes whose functions higher during growth first genes should expressed less second
comparing related genomes multiple also suggests their been
general major significantly more conserved genes greater overall greater
together patterns support general theory secondary evolutionary test subject reduced selection thus greater rates change
key prediction theory genes found secondary should more than those primary
furthermore if genes secondary been less needed used over long time then they should exhibit less bias towards use
tested theory evolutionary rates defined genes present single subset species among two sets genomes more than one
then compared rates found primary those secondary bias genes their evolutionary patterns context only single
found secondary indeed less towards selection than those primary
increased rates evolution appear reduced selection use specific because less expression
each prediction general theory secondary evolutionary test genes was therefore
