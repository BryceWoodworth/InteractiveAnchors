further potential mechanisms within using markov model network communication

introduction
many recent studies both experimental computational point ability proteins under state conditions conformational changes usually their biological function
proteins via their binding population form
multiple structures given protein different now possible identify changes structure assumed given protein upon binding different observed those protein prior binding
observations suggest intrinsic dynamics interactions
contrast model where change
instead model where selection those upon binding
yet choice between intrinsic dynamics between dynamics function still depend particular systems study
experiments provide evidence example existence between time scales conformational low frequency appear potentially reaction rates
other hand other studies point different time scales events control binding events
furthermore while intrinsic dynamics form observed mechanism may also structural local scale at binding site
given dynamics potential functional structure proteins basis their would expected relevant features
importance respect clear understanding their relationship binding if any into functional mechanisms protein
protein dynamics means simulations models methods
simulations molecular dynamics describe conformational system over range
small proteins main do not allow accurate sampling usually biological interest
approaches other hand lack but provide into global
among them network models found wide use normal analyses
describe protein network nodes usually identified spatial c
constant nodes network model
despite description protein studies shown predicted describe well experimentally observed conformational changes provide into potential mechanisms function performed more detailed models
recent studies et al point conformational space described obtained provided long sample
present study amino kinase family
family following basis sequence structural kinase kinase kinase kinase
studied family proposed among likely give similar mechanism binding
most widely studied family taking into account large amount structural information
indeed structural family its dynamics mechanisms family perform their function
step
through produce
activity may taking into account potential target
many organisms step
cases feedback end recent studies mechanism
other hand
its mechanism been most characterized among
particular studies provided into its mechanisms binding
residues each being into
each makes binding site whereas
reaction place at between two domains within each
studies show no evidence between structure provides stability only been evolutionary selected perform function
structures bound state two types functional structures either too active site let whereas structure more open active site
suggests conformational likely upon binding since all structure whether bound not
complex ability solution without active site
therefore must able open close other structural elements
aim present study
given interest knowledge mechanism potential role dynamics function analyze here motion
using family what extent motion other family
