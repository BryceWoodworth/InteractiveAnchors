introduction
evolutionary conserved form cell allows organisms cells order
associated various conditions including cancer
also known central
most cases stimuli whose cellular various cellular
intrinsic pathways major cellular
pathway then various proteins including into signaling complex
formation signaling complex leads into active then
intrinsic pathway family
event family results proteins into
c then into active complex allows activation
additional regulation intrinsic through binding
experimental studies revealed activation intrinsic pathway depends cellular context
c some cells while activation was observed other systems
event does not affect function been suggested activation cells
c activation even after strong c after c formation was
furthermore time activation via intrinsic pathway allows cellular after stimuli
finally t cells intrinsic pathway potential if was
activation was found event
differences activation suggest intrinsic pathway some cells but others
while simple systems manner complex systems exhibit true responses some cases
thought require positive may either positive feedback feedback
threshold stimulus positive allow systems low activation levels high activation levels
systems different obtained depending upon whether system its its state
some cases state after stimulus so system shows activation
experimental studies indeed occurs natural biological networks
recent mathematical modeling demonstrated hidden feedback usually not explicitly biochemical reaction
present model results positive feedback
cellular proteins cellular signaling mechanism described paper likely principle how cells achieve
