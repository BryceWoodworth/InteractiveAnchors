most genes able several phenomenon known alternative
alternative occur cancer leading expression multiple
most studies alternative focused identification potential targets
here examine instead analyze their level using measure uncertainty called entropy
compare expression entropy normal cancer same site different classes alternative transcription
whereas alternative show no significant gain loss entropy between normal cancer alternative shows highly significant entropy gains studied
entropy gain characterized expression normal correlated level estimated cellular cancer
genes present entropy gain factors
provide here first quantitative estimate cancer
expression normal widely significantly at least studied
may develop part key factors turn significantly impact multiple target genes
introduction
genes produce alternative part their normal expression program
alternative include transcription expressed different gene expression required cell functions
alternative especially at level known affect cell
large body evidence between alternative cancer so identification now considered important cancer
expression cancer may result very different underlying genetic events
one hand mutations sequences lead expression specific observed example gene cancer
another class event processing its pathway
may affect specific genes but may also expression processing multiple genes affected
evidence changes alternative transcription cancer present instance where large actually
however while most studies cancer significant disease cells no work focused potentially when
aim present study evaluate extent alternative cancer
instead distribution all single gene given
where distribution may more disordered than control
measure level notion entropy information theory
applied measure all three types alternative transcription comparing distributions pairs disease normal
our results show alternative alternative transcription associated disordered expression
however studied alternative showed highly significant entropy gain relative corresponding normal
analyze entropy gain discuss its possible
