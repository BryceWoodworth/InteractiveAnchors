introduction
protein essential molecular required quality control proteins
fundamental protein interaction networks key many cellular functions
correct activation among cellular wide range proteins
functions range signal regulatory mechanisms response
proteins typically include transcription factors other proteins points cellular responses multiple signals
given its role at fundamental cellular pathways clear associated many cancer protein
because role disease development activity become area very research molecular particular
activity small some its shown activity models recently evaluation humans
further trials also been other small molecules also used drug various cancer types
complex cycle binding
initial structural individual domains human yeast
structures larger also been reported
first structures yeast bound revealed structure individual
each turn characterized three regulatory domain binding domain site necessary proteins domain required
same global states
structures complex either state showed different
state open structure each three domains area while form form more state
structural biochemical studies solution state its using small provided first experimental evidence highly dynamic stochastic nature between different conformational states molecular efficient recognition
more recent solution structure data obtained using single modeling approaches showed may among different open extended states still provided binding may towards
particular data revealed state extended state could significantly effects
contrast structures showed there relatively little difference between two bound states extended structures
recent studies based mutation analysis suggested different states presence
studies upon binding specific functional states using intrinsic conformational
although exact mechanism between protein still combination structural observations biochemical data conformational two close state but not states
conformational cycle involves through molecular mechanism
terms intrinsic protein dynamics mechanism conformational cycle involves conformational state upon binding whereas leads more state
finally form open state

its position structure over bound its possible importance cycle
studies results human solution showed binding conformational changes at
moreover shown binding depend intrinsic conformational obtained different species towards
analysis cycle suggested during cycle may open state
contrast yeast open state only percent structure observed presence
hence conformational during cycle similar different proteins while between individual may differences binding
overall solution data suggested molecular mechanism cycle more described stochastic process binding intrinsic conformational between open state protein state seen different structures
most recent structural studies e yeast human further existence universal conformational cycle states intrinsic conformational between states dependent
according results evolutionary may through relevant conformational response presence protein
binding conformational far state e yeast whereas conformational human open form even presence binding
study shown binding provides only small energy rather than different conformational states existing dynamic
overall intrinsic conformational critical molecular cycle including structural adaptation proteins
different cycle binding different proteins specific functions
instance molecular two systems
binding involves interactions at both domains
contrast increases rates increasing
case binding other was shown required complex while
