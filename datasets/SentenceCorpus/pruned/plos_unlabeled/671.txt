proteins been widely used biological
recently new class proteins was between state
proteins not only provide much below limit but also other applications data
potential proteins rational their properties requires detailed understanding molecular mechanism unknown
here studied mechanism at level state molecular dynamics simulations
our simulations explain measured state also predict structures unknown state
further find distribution active site pathways protein matrix
changes state some amino lead different states all turn out essential mechanism
states after
overall stability different states state
finally propose pathways thus leads
identified proteins essential their function propose detailed underlying mechanism provides available experimental data
structural similarity between other interest suggests general mechanism proteins
rational design optimization proteins
introduction
proteins been widely used protein dynamics cells
recently new class protein like proteins been between state
molecules usually not very unique feature may allow new applications
example also known may provide far field much below limit
proteins will protein single cells
since out data
protein protein
protein its state state
state same at
upon maximum at at
state initial state
state through within
addition if over long time also into state cannot any more
nature state unknown
cycle many times without significant
properties recently demonstrated
however its low rather properties need
potential proteins rational properties detailed molecular understanding mechanism
aim study obtain detailed mechanism at level understand dynamics both activation process process
structures its state its state its states were recently determined
similar
reaction
compared system additional group
was possible even within protein analysis showed conformational
recent study shown changes pattern some amino changes account observed upon
based comparison between measured major states state been whereas
here study behavior each previously identified states
following how does within protein matrix how do different states affect mechanism
species how increased
address questions out molecular dynamics simulations using approach
approach between state state
were using method although not always highly accurate shown method studies reactions involving
number approaches modeling dynamics been described literature multiple
recent see
context simulations approach problems been
approach used work other approaches two main
first our approach binary decision made at each integration time step based only current states
second only at where probability approaches
could principle because do not allow regions strong but no real
however reactions large systems place at also shown others
thus most our approach
addition both energy conserved upon transition energy
theoretical detailed information
several theoretical studies been both dynamics simulations based
addition model phase were methods well protein environment means within approach
key residues our molecular dynamics simulations how protein protein
based simulations provide new mechanism measured times predicts structures states state
also suggest state play important role
however detailed study processes paper
our predictions
