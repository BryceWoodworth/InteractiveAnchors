introduction

large protein means across
small small across while larger will generally only if they particular signal sequence signal signal
signal sequences factors resulting factor through
studied factors family related proteins although other factors also particularly
up at rates high several per second each factor complex time order
here focus although our other types well including
during via their signals
then through where its form factor
high binding allows
bound through where factor
energy used then next cycle
only step process requires input metabolic energy
overall energy obtained used concentration between so process actual across occurs
into three first second through third
first been subject studies relatively well being reactions biochemical
much less
clear ability particular class proteins known key feature process allows them their through
particular experiments binding sites were show binding
current estimates binding most range 1 depending type
each usually small region body larger region characterized multiple
regions disordered contain binding sites factors also appear set up at cannot them
detailed nature still under active study although been shown form when solution
been demonstrated individual regions long order many within
what still needed quantitative theoretical account observed characteristics
here develop theory explain mechanism through
useful theory should provide into several major questions how does achieve high variable both through only factor
how does binding factors while high factor bound
how high degree
up regions regions potentially set up
across even concentration
how account high degree robustness
several theoretical models been proposed mechanism through
include model phase models model models reduction model most recently model
all models thought where set up into through involves
they differ only specific assumptions spatial their state distribution binding sites
aim present paper general quantitative framework consistent structural functional properties its components
explain how binding give efficient
demonstrate limited space binding sites within leads novel highly process
finally explain how could account high robustness respect structural changes
experimental predictions model
