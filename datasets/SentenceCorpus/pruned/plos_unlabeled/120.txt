one major structural determine structure many different possible
comparative modeling expected structural models experimentally determined proteins
however approach essential quality experimentally determined structures
model protein found two potential both experimentally determined structures structural
despite their high sequence two structures different
us perform analyses both structure experimental data results identify one two models
next quality large set recent structure both structural individual structure groups
visual structures lower quality than structure not
overall our results quality structures cannot using only experimental input data overall quality reference demonstrate need integration more structure tools structure
contrast common where structures typically whole tools should basis
introduction
experimentally determined structures form structural any structural analysis would without them
two main techniques available structure
important all resulting structure models derived their underlying experimental data
any experiment thus any structure model will errors associated
random errors depend experimental measurements models
errors often result errors experimental data directly accuracy structure models
example errors introduced errors most likely made when protein structure density
several studies shown not all experimentally determined structure models high quality
many different types errors identified protein structures too molecules
where type errors often does not large analysis structure typically field latter structure model all practical
years several errors been protein data often models ones
example structure model first structure protein
structure was under now
model later showed original model density had been
similar problems model was later when structure was but now at higher
also structures determined using cases known where experimental data often corresponding structure structures
example original structure domain
difference two was observed between structure latter after structure
data identification three original several new resulting original
similar low number signals factor
case was not second solution structure was experimental data original structure were errors were
paper describe detailed analysis two recently structures protein one human one
both structures large structural structure human was determined structural was determined structural
despite percent sequence large structural differences observed between two result
using experimental data show only structure correct
analyze both using various structure data methods show structure could been identified prior
finally large set protein structures were show example does not its own but more errors found
some how future large errors identified during structure process using available
