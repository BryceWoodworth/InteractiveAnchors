introduction
increasing number human associated proteins their functional into
into conditions occurs brain occurs single type other than brain occurs multiple
associated human generally described when they whereas term been suggested more appropriate when related form cell
formation not however those protein
several other proteins no been found form structural properties allow them
finding idea ability form structure property main interactions
theoretical perspective was also recently shown simple sufficient explain within same framework limited single structures multiple
ability form structure been systems specific some organisms been found during their normal physiological life cycle one more their proteins into functional properties rather than effects
most functions ability genetic
proteins addition specific
their states proteins able form do not any sequence structural each other
differences proteins common properties resulting
obtained transmission usually 2 each about 2
generally together form typically wide form long 2 high up wide
data shown protein molecules so long
other techniques protein our ability gain into structures
us presence structure
studies indeed identification regions sequence form core those
many cases various molecules also been determined nature structural molecules along
one studies particularly long sequences core but also possible especially
at same time studies revealed simple between properties
development different methods predict regions sequence protein
all approaches focus predicting intrinsic sequence using only sequence input
possible sequence itself was also taken into account
molecular dynamics simulations sequence either were used identify most specific case
structure based also very recent method
question why found most core
here introduce computational approach energy function based two residues found within one another determined proteins known structures
two different sets depending
our method energy specific two sequence same length further distinct protein molecules involved formation will order better core
novel feature our method ability predict between sequence
way observed tendency proteins into individual form same type along
our algorithm also able between either
further robustness approach will ability our algorithm predict sequence core set proteins experimentally determined structures similar previously proposed methods
our approach based key assumption universal mechanism formation both proteins
predictions obtained work suggest validity above hypothesis framework presented previously
