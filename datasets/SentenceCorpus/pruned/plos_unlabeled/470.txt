many biological systems interactions describe between different genetic network stochastic
study between using responses cells different
experimental data show mean value response cell population described mathematical expression large range conditions
stochastic theoretical model was developed empirical mean response
moreover theoretical model predicts specific biological probability distribution responses cell population
prediction was experimentally measurements at level
computational approach used study other stochastic biological
introduction
complex biological systems out number components
components dna sequence elements transcription factors etc concentration each component changes over time
one way understand functions complex biological system construct quantitative model interactions present system
interactions usually terms components interaction process
example concentration molecules
being interactions also stochastic
process not probability rate
what follows stochastic model response cells will developed
just one example many ways molecular system
general perspective structure molecular system different system under study then responses system measured
experimental pairs input output signals describe system
fundamental idea systems biology long field
input signals applied through use signal
input signal parameters change being its
protein family protein highly
protein molecular critical component complex genetic network effects
since thus important complex system our goal was find if possible develop mathematical model regulation its expression cells
our specific were determine average expression over time cell population after initial determine how physical parameters influence parameters determine mathematical model expression at level
first describe process mathematical model experimental data
then mathematical study model will
