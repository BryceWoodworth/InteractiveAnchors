studies aim our understanding more complex relationship between us our
important computational tools able compare large datasets generated complex identify features them
present statistical method comparing samples two treatment populations basis data features
our method discovery rate improve environments features using exact test
under variety simulations show well compared previously used methods significantly other methods features sparse
demonstrate utility our method several datasets including human functional metabolic data random sequencing
application our method differences between subjects not reported original study
datasets provide first differences between populations
methods described paper first address datasets samples multiple subjects
our methods robust across datasets complexity sampling level
while designed applications our also applied gene expression studies
our methods available source found at
introduction
increasing sequencing new field analyses
sequencing populations allows us first at many cannot through means
studies environmental samples focused sequencing individual genes particular rna though more recent studies take advantage sequencing methods not only but also functional
several tools been developed recent years comparing different environments basis sequence data
all focus different aspects analysis
clusters sequences into provides estimates population measure comparing different
similarity between two environments specifically between two
provide hypothesis test whether two different question context
note methods aim whether rather than how two differ
latter question particularly important analyze human health
analysis trials will require information at individual levels future experiments
example would like identify whose presence human disease develop
question was first et al who use estimate associated differences between biological
more recently et al provides allows compare different environments
note only one among above applied data other than obtained
tools one common they all designed comparing two samples therefore limited setting where goal compare two treatment populations each multiple samples
paper describe statistical approach features between datasets
method both data
our approach statistical methods developed analysis
specifically methods data correct sparse
our research was increasing focus applications
note similar problem been context gene expression studies
et al model use negative distribution analysis multiple
both approaches applied datasets
compare our prior through simulations demonstrate performance our approach available datasets including human random functional
methods described paper been also available free
