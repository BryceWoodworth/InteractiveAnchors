investigate particular case rate function results modeling number transmission process
also into account population per individual transmission probability
model both classical rate functions time series number
also model both rate functions data sets
two evidence our model rate may very well better description processes studied here
first our model was selected best according two different information two different likelihood
second evidence what model classical rate predicts solution model rate will either disease free depending initial conditions
findings along computer simulations environmental clear environmental disease transmission dynamics
introduction
models involving formula formula formula individuals been proposed data sets
well defined within mathematical research area study models
models useful understanding observed patterns natural processes human
here our attention formula formula models introduce while structural form rates
two transmission mechanisms were two simple functional rates
show so able clear environmental disease transmission dynamics
rates functions critical modeling
paper showed because there many choices form structure interactions there rate functional choose
not literature mathematical analyses many functional
however biological first rate functional not too common
show study using first practice models data while testing biological
thus despite amount available functional rates set models chosen data should those first
study first show simple probabilistic setting stochastic process leads general form proposed previously later
rate leads models different dynamics compared ones obtained using classical rate
model either rate formula function time formula target thus limit
target between two points
either model target between point disease free when formula 1
model classical rate mechanism does not depend initial conditions
work show disease free model rate
leads where two regions
formula will either disease free solutions depending initial conditions
furthermore after model selection show model rate leads significant over classical model same
finally compared classical rates functions them two time series data sets
using later function leads model both cases
since were model use data two data set where effects expected less dynamics
form contact rate function while including environmental models leads better understanding dynamics disease transmission
depending model contact rate disease free either point
first case if environmental noise may stable then
if however stable at may end up
interaction between different contact rate models was studied using computer simulations
