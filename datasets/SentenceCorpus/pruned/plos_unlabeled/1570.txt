into many distinct
during neural development dependent expression patterns several genes
along play particularly strong role
however our understanding regulatory interactions between genes lead their particular spatial patterns
therefore used computational model interactions between genes determine interactions interactions occur networks expression patterns observed experimentally
model expression levels nature expression data available
gene expression patterns all formula possible networks genes interest
found only formula networks were able experimentally observed expression patterns
networks all certain interactions interactions including
many higher order interactions also networks our good performance
while there was structure networks perform well analysis probability each interaction interactions most likely present gene network area development
found general interactions much more likely than ones but not critical correct network
overall our model design gene network area development makes novel predictions tested experimentally
introduction
complex but structure
into several distinct different gene expression specific patterns input output
but how does functional
there strong evidence both genetic mechanisms play role development process also
genetic component spatial expression some genes prior well fact expression some genes early development changes area position
other hand hence activity area size area
results current model process where initial spatial patterns gene expression provide
activity then more complex gene expression turn further area specific
paper how patterns gene expression form early development
experiments identified many genes expressed critical
although occurs field most experiments focus hence here along
expressed at
after expression four transcription factors expressed across
four research target because their expression could provide unique system information
expression each four area
furthermore during development expression each genes up expression some other genes set along
large experiments given network regulatory interactions between genes
however only one interactions been directly demonstrated no analysis been performed at systems level
known able form regulatory networks spatial development role better known
feedback feature spatial patterns expression genes network
since expression other genes local differences expression set method spatial patterns growth expression cues more complex patterns gene expression
genes form regulatory network many feedback principle spatial patterns
interactions critical correct interest field but current experimental approaches limited their ability importance each particular interaction
computational gene regulatory networks necessary because their complex difficult understand
addition several other
many interactions between genes represented like seen
because simple presence many feedback makes about overall complex systems
more description than would test current model potential give greater understanding many other regulatory networks
found mathematical computational models making assumptions therefore greater
computational experiments also performed relative experiments useful thought experiments then tested experimentally
way computational experiments each other so both manner
here use approach model regulatory network
approach variables genes proteins take only two values one gene protein activity being below above some threshold effect
while continuous models more they many free parameters experimental data computational investigate
contrast models used when only expression interaction data available case
models at each point time state variable depends state its at previous time step
set regulatory relationships between variables how system time
number free parameters while still network dynamics predictions
our model use only two spatial one another
expression levels after shown
more than two expression levels more than two spatial would more but would result number parameters experimental data
having only two expression levels only two allows us large number networks would more complex model
paper dynamics all possible networks different interactions between show only formula networks able expression patterns observed experimentally
analysis identify structural elements common best networks well elements appear networks perform well
results important underlying gene network suggest potential future experimental
