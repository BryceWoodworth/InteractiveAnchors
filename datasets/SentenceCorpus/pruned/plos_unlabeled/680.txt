introduction
two been identification genes involved human
more recently our ability genetic disease increased due genome sequence
disease been identification mutation still very task because region may typically contain
many genome analysis not yet associated any disease gene
therefore strategies most likely targets patients critical importance
many different strategies been proposed genes critical
some methods so far developed rely observation disease genes tend common global properties directly comparative sequence analysis
however most available strategies based widely idea genes proteins organisms their functions part functional based complex series physical metabolic regulatory interactions
although principle been used even identify critical many different biological present information gene function interactions gene expression different experimental models allows problem greater
theory use functional gene would represent most approach
however although strategy may very useful selected cases at present clear either because genes because not how functions disease
therefore computational methods less knowledge may strong
particular interaction gene data experiments represent sources potentially relevant information
recently direct integration very human similarity prediction high confidence within large
although approach highly efficient not because very close functional relationships between genes proteins possible direct molecular binding
addition interaction space many biological interactions not yet been identified experiments
experiments known result large
low interactions between experiments even when same proteins considered problems
finally many known interactions been through experiments thus strongly towards proteins
since genes involved same functions tend show very similar expression analysis could very approach functional relationships may similar disease
global analyses shown genes highly across experiments very similar functional
however so far criterion not been very prediction genetic disease been used only combination other independent evidence
nature gene expression datasets may represent one possible
moreover even when two genes observed under high number experimental conditions does not genes related
instance analysis data across different species revealed genes more likely than genes genomic regions even if they not related any manner
been previously proposed very strong criterion identify relevant among genes
indeed significant two more genes very likely due advantage strongly functional relation
therefore conserved could much criterion than single species genes involved similar disease
report show conserved analysis produce accurate predictions human disease genes
using approach were able small number strong human corresponding wide different
