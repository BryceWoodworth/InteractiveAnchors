gain into evolution through transition cell compared well yeast overall there been large during evolution
early evolution proteins involved cell whereas proteins involved transcription cell regulation signal been proteins
more than what remains including metabolic pathways directly involved energy
results taking control its protein
introduction
found all cells
addition their role energy involved many processes groups amino clusters
analyses genes all derive single
during its series including among others protein leading situation only proteins
large thought evolution
according recent variety pathways pathways
some studies focused evolution some pathways
however no analysis been performed so far analyze transition at larger scale
still unknown example aspects its what extent current metabolic observed different organisms was through gain loss proteins
address questions compared their metabolic pathways
used similar approach one used previously smaller set genomes
approach proteins proteins they proteins those relation between proteins proteins
metabolic pathways were recent highly yeast human
comparison functional classification only classes corresponding protein do
other classes either been proteins
metabolic transition compared
comparing three metabolic pathways main metabolic transition early well later metabolic pathways
our results increasing bias energy significant metabolic other cellular complete transcription signal gene regulation
