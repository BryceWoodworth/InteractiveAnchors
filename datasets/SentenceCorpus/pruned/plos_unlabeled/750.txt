cellular response environmental cue typically stimulus
example yeast concentration whether cells growth growth
signaling pathways stimulus response must quantitative information about signal
our previous experimental results suggest yeast concentration signal
here use mathematical modeling analyze possible biochemical mechanisms
demonstrate signal increases range stimulus responses increased dynamic range result signaling responses still possible after
propose mechanism yeast pathway consistent current experimental observations
most previous information processing signaling pathways focused without temporal aspects signal
here demonstrate provides cells alternative mechanism processing quantitative information about their environment
ability signaling pathways stimulus into signal results directly nature systems importance dynamic properties signaling pathways when their behavior
understanding how signaling pathways quantitative information about environment will not only our understanding systems but also provide into how function pathways become disease
introduction
many variety affect cellular behavior binding membrane signaling pathways
pathways information membrane selected cellular components generate appropriate response environmental cue
however signaling networks not simply systems but signals
example used between pathways
negative feedback allows pathways stimuli
many cases nature response depends stimulus
thus addition information signaling pathways must also quantitative information about stimulus
many signaling pathways cell receptor g protein series protein including protein kinase
widely cells but also found yeast
response pathway yeast provides example cellular response depends concentration stimulus
at low levels cells growth
at cells develop presence growth source stimulus process known growth
finally at high cells program leads growth development
therefore yeast make correct decision quantitative information about concentration must appropriate cellular components
here use mathematical modeling investigate different ways information
results analysis taken together our recently data demonstrate pathway uses strategy signal
because yeast response pathway receptor kinase results our should direct signal cells
