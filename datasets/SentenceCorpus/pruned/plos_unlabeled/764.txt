introduction
one best studied species
species wide potential able produce range
features along their genetic expression make particularly
p been produce
furthermore p been variety other processes including into biochemical formation
however most applications still due lack knowledge relationships under conditions relevant environmental
effort towards critical knowledge genomes several been being series studies specific aspects their genomic behavior under various
sequencing p p research generally provided means investigate metabolic potential p species development new applications
whole genome analysis revealed among other features genetic play role those relevant
however despite clear our understanding p through sequencing effort relationship between cannot predicted simply gene functions genes found genome work still needed before genome into metabolic model value predicting cell
modeling only approach modeling metabolic network at
model all reactions known along set constraints each reaction system
major advantage approach model does not require knowledge reactions
models define global metabolic space network structural properties distribution potential provide framework through metabolic cell
through various analysis techniques models help predict cellular given particular environmental conditions
analysis one technique optimization objective while all reactions achieve set consistent output objective function
when chosen objective output correlated growth model become predictive growth
analysis techniques including been metabolic features variety organisms few cases thus far they been used
however all previous applications approach was used design biochemical studies only directly objective function used underlying problem
major methods predict any reaction not directly chosen objective
since pathways most value application processes useful predictor output
other analysis methods pathways analysis related pathways but due numerical methods they could not used so far predict at
address both metabolic p use p developed present here metabolic network analysis its network properties through modeling potential model
