introduction
protein protein interactions play key role many cellular processes
important step towards description processes structural proteins their
there two computational approaches predict structure protein complex given structures its components comparative modeling protein protein
first approach target complex standard comparative methods model using known structure complex
approach limited sparse structural binary interactions
second approach model predicted protein protein structures individual without any interactions
usually two protein structures through large set possible
experimental information obtained also used protein
while any two whose structures known both sampling relevant large number alternatives
here propose third approach modeling between two structures
approach called comparative analysis protein comparative modeling based complex greater than comparative modeling higher accuracy than
comparative analysis our prior analysis binding sites within domains
analysis binding sites often conserved their binding
structure target complex thus protein only those binding sites domains
result comparative analysis knowledge all interactions involving either one two
find comparative analysis increases prediction accuracy relative protein
able identify binding percent predicting overall structure average error compared protein
contrast protein binding percent
