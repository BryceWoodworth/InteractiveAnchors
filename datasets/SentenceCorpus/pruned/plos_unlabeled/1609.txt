binding proteins large family molecular play key role
all central
upon binding their large conformational change binding
conformational change however intrinsic dynamics protein may also recognition
recent experiments shown binding protein exists mixture open state state
here describe simulations provide detailed transition between open states existence between two states
find part protein called during
residues region important role conformational change
between open states size binding site
study provides detailed description conformational space available understanding recognition related proteins
introduction
binding proteins major components cell involved
use into
differ they different design directly receptor
addition several contain binding domains
include g including
many drug targets
structures been called general mechanisms recognition been identified large variety amino
also make them design properties
binding protein part system efficient

been subject study due its importance various biological pathways its utility protein expression
protein into two domains c domain n domain
two domains via short form region
like other binding site between domains
structures presence protein important conformational change open state presence effect better size
conformational change been mechanism due its only when
mechanism often describe recognition process
binding site directly protein
also possible protein exists mixture open
case would play more role state mechanism described conformational selection population
computer simulations studies often needed between two scenarios structures typically do not provide detailed information about available protein
recently our understanding mechanism recognition studies only two possible open bound structure
et al reported first measurements
protein domain could studied
measurements existence dynamic between major open state state
because experimental rates could not either structure was possible structure exists
transition between open state was determined involve region
best between experimental data was obtained exists between major open state state percent time very small energy difference between two states
between states was estimated between s
theoretical point view between different could play important role recognition
however remains using simulations detailed statistical analysis conformational dynamics proteins
past development efficient simulation algorithms large number theoretical studies using molecular dynamics simulations intrinsic dynamics
et al studied binding protein using simulations
they observed large protein direction structure found open structure was more than structure
et al general result comparative study different also showed different could different properties
authors also observed rate presence could fast even though they also sampling events was
et al performed simulations protein involved b
using simulations each they were able both simulations larger simulations
behavior protein was model
observation molecular open state was other groups similar binding proteins binding proteins
studied open form reported events during simulations
taken together studies intrinsic
recognition through mechanism structure very tendency along lead open structure
simulation study protein was out et al
using simulations both open states without authors could show structure state presence
state was found open state when was
conformational change was consistent experimental rate constant binding 1 2 1 s 1 suggests rate
however simulations was too short any between open
rate between two
paper used molecular dynamics simulations show protein exists between open
number methods been developed sampling conformational changes proteins including conformational
however within framework study key advantage allows us study conformational behavior dynamics protein without using reaction
previous studies been study dynamics proteins
conformational space also been shown significantly improve theoretical prediction experimental dynamic
paper show simulations allow study transition open state hidden
provides first view transition between open states
parameters simulations well experiments
free energy used provide new into mechanism between open states
