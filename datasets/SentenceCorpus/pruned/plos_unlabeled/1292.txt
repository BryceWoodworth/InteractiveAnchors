predict higher than estimates due elements one one between predicted elements known functional sequences
efficient effective provide both within multiple sequence
introduction
identification all functional elements human genome one main general particular
comparative sequence analysis multiple sequence human genome species become goal sequence due negative selection often strong signal biological function
after multiple sequence alignment one evolutionary rates at level individual identify alignment show significantly levels
several computational methods detection been developed most into one two approaches explicitly model distribution within alignment approaches first estimate at individual then clusters highly
widely used approach uses markov model find most likely alignment into hidden states
while widely used modeling biological sequences they known transition probabilities specific state distribution context means predicted length
may bias resulting estimates length total genomic under
one leading approaches terms difference between rate observed rate estimated maximum likelihood manner
however because its maximum likelihood uses maximization algorithm estimate new set each position step also because involves parameters data
furthermore heuristic used may biases length predicted
work present novel method detection like uses metric
uses significantly more robust maximum likelihood estimation procedure expected rates evolution results more than reduction time
addition introduce novel criterion into elements using statistical our predictions
apply dynamic approach predict set elements their positive rate estimate
using alignment human genome other species over elements over percent human genome high confidence
compared previous methods predict larger human genome elements due many but elements very low positive rate
