robust against random
robustness physical point view
versus quantitative measure robustness network
seen possible principle natural selection at cellular network level
provides optimal criterion network design
our approach general applied other cellular networks
introduction
underlying mechanism cellular networks understand their biological function
underlying nature cellular networks been genetic techniques
cellular networks been found generally robust perform their biological functions against environmental
there increasing numbers studies global structures networks recently properties networks been found
highly nodes network essential network together might play important role robustness network
however there so far very few studies why network should robust perform biological function physical point view
theoretical models cellular networks often been set rate
local
global properties one often change parameters
parameter space
global robustness therefore see approach
here will explore nature networks another problem terms potential function potential energy
if potential energy cellular network known global properties
fact global properties when interaction system
set normal rate cellular networks being proteins being reaction rate one cannot general potential energy function
however reaction network only average concentration level
cell statistical finite number molecules provide source intrinsic noise highly environments cell provide source noise networks
both noise play important properties network
general one should study reaction network conditions model cellular environments more
one also study properties reaction networks under environments
potential state network exists general
network problem terms potential energy function potential energy issue global stability robustness much address
fact paper study global robustness problem directly properties potential network
explore nature underlying potential cellular networks will study yeast network
one most important functions cell growth
therefore understand cell cycle its underlying process
cell during development usually into several s
most cells control mechanisms over dna make events cell cycle out
there usually three before new before process before
recently many underlying mechanisms revealed genetic techniques mutations gene
been found control been protein major events cell cycle
example activation cells at both further
during other
although molecular interactions known mechanisms still
1 relationship between cell cycle
step 1
may
form
at some point after formation
then form active
principle activation may protein kinase
when sufficient been but active step
complex subject
finally cycle itself
mathematical models cell cycle been set underlying biochemical processes
models been applied yeast cycle many physiological behaviors
fixed points
since signal changes regulatory networks cell cycle described dynamics out fixed points
although detailed simulations give some towards due parameter space search difficult global universal properties cycle networks
current study address issue
will develop global energy theory cell cycle network
approach good two
approach only most important factors so analysis out relatively some global properties
other hand statistical approach very useful when data
there many possible states network corresponding different patterns activation protein states
each low energy states
phase states should global energy since end cycle
new cycle network signal next phase
dynamics cell cycle described state space one another
search not random but since random search time
direction provided towards phase
therefore towards state what call state
at end phase network high energy states at
cell cycle then follows through state space way several finally phase before being another cycle
will study global stability underlying potential yeast network
aim paper provide framework study at cell network
at paper show potential yeast cell cycle robust against rates environmental through noise
