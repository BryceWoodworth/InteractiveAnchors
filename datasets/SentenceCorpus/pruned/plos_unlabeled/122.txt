become clear large functional dna human genome does not protein
identification functional sequence using comparative approaches difficult previously been thought require sequencing multiple
here introduce new model comparative method instead uses evolutionary past selection
model predicts distribution under shows human data
across genome many long regions model predict highly functional dna been subject selection respect
use model determine under selection between percent percent human
since genes only percent results further weight more than functional human genome
method at selected sequence using only two three genomes
method human genomes identify human sequence under selection at predicted percent rate percent sensitivity
expected most identified sequence while known genes predicted sensitivity method
high sensitivity functional sequence suggest yet genes among sequences identified
its us identify sequence been subject selection sequence subject both positive selection respect selection respect
ability identify elements under selection first time positive selection functional elements other than genes
introduction
human genome been evolutionary mutation genetic selection latter main functional regions mutations
comparing human genomes previously was estimated about percent human genome point mutations than expected under model
most likely effects selection mutations observation at least percent human genome functional
since only known large class functional genomic elements only percent our genome remains result
understand biological role functional elements essential first step their identification
recent studies most highly conserved elements elements
elements exhibit high level even among studies suggest elements alternative development
however elements not conserved respect point mutations identification elements within dna difficult
among conserved biological function but less recently sequence
comparative methods related species typically analyze patterns conserved regions
methods they information along sequence achieve high
although methods because rates due instance levels state activity leads reduction sensitivity
sequencing genomes power comparative methods while will represent most solution sensitivity problem
all mutation processes point most less
while models been studied gene finding been evolutionary events alignment but
view show highly evolutionary events
introduce model distribution over genome show model large human alignment data well
then show model main not rates but consistent selection genome functional regions
first applied model derive lower bounds genome under selection respect
our observations between human genome been under selection since human
although still much higher than percent represented lower estimate than previous percent estimate based but consistent more recent estimate
elements before human found between observations model predictions
same method before predict among only at most been under selection
first time our knowledge model evolution
second application model identified large sequence elements under selection
model us predicted rate set well bayesian probabilities individual elements under selection
set various independent functional both positive negative shown highly functional dna
key proposed method its selection respect point mutations
method provide independent selection methods based
moreover method allows identification sequence elements been under selection been subject selection respect but subject positive selection constraints respect
examples elements would include between regulatory elements whose relative distance those shown exist
although functional sequence constraints respect
even more class elements whose sequence under positive selection respect while at same time under selection respect
since highly function rna genes reduced rates compared dna elements exist
without evolutionary selection difficult see how identify functional elements under positive selection respect functional only exists genes
analysis percent sequence suggested much percent dna under selection may under selection
among elements identified those exhibit more than expected number dna still showed functional above further existence elements under selection
