introduction
understand brain function essential study activity neural
activity typically they observed local field potential both activity responses
space patterns often take form clusters activity
over large populations neurons shown several patterns occur across regions
over time patterns often do not at specific
they about space
so they each other resulting behavior
here will consider what functional role behavior may
patterns been experimental literature activity
presence several patterns been observed activity visual response patterns visual various species well
when several patterns occur together they likely
indeed interactions been shown occur
describe activity visual term was explicitly used interactions patterns
despite patterns their interactions their fundamental functional role unknown
although some authors role functional other aspects presence multiple patterns their interactions
current theoretical describe neural activity either computational systems
computational theory based representation
perspective temporal brain activity systems approach
when systems theories applied concept stable
notion although provided many important less functional role brain activity its actual complexity
need standard systems theories order describe neural activity understand its fundamental function
study based neural systems large numbers simple neurons connectivity
extended physical systems large numbers simple elements systems systems patterns common feature known under different including others
they property systems
using systems construct simple extended neural model represent within
property system activity patterns some observed empirical studies
particular provides multiple patterns their interactions
how their behavior demonstrate what fundamental function patterns
patterns support several essential aspects computational processing
objects patterns signal information across neural
information processing occurs when they specifically each other
patterns perform distributed computational neural systems work efficient way
call distributed proposed framework understanding activity patterns neural
understanding their dynamics form
