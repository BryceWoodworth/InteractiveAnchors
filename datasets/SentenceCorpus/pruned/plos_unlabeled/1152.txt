paper provided search heuristic criterion given set gene
however heuristic not optimal solutions its search makes practice
paper provide two exact solutions problem species tree set gene under criterion
other words our solutions find tree total number set gene
one solution based novel linear another based simple dynamic approach
make first solution particularly very problem whereas solution tools its makes other genomic events may gene tree
using exact solutions analyze data set yeast species data set species several data sets
show criterion provides very accurate estimates species tree our solutions very fast thus accurate analysis data sets
further solutions allow solutions important criterion show
show species tree graph clusters gene may sufficient practice finding computational optimization solutions
further study statistical consistency convergence rate criterion well its species tree
finally show how our solutions used identify potential gene events may some data thus original framework

introduction
accurate species model evolutionary sets species play central role comparative studies analyses population among many other applications
species tree sequencing single group species its tree known gene tree using method maximum likelihood tree species tree
underlying assumption gene tree species tree hence learning latter
however long assumption not always
due sequencing approach standard method very recently
sequencing complete genomes various organisms available particularly important data multiple organisms available
data multiple various groups species
analyses many cases among gene same set organisms
therefore while gene tree requires process species tree requires addition process among gene so species
paper address problem efficient inference accurate species multiple when gene assumed correct their assumed due
also address integration gene potential gene tree into framework
let us process way gene tree
evolutionary perspective any evolutionary history set genomes would tree same tree models evolution each gene genomes
however events among different genome those may take different through results gene differ species tree well each other due
gene tree due been shown recently several groups related organisms including yeast
case gene need within species tree shown 1
few methods been introduced recently gene their species despite
generally each methods follows one two combined analysis approach analysis see 2
combined analysis sequences multiple resulting data set using methods maximum maximum
analysis approach sequence data each first gene then
one way gene taking their
another method taking tree frequency among all gene species tree
methods based two approaches been various researchers
recently bayesian methods following analysis approach been developed
while methods statistical basis they very time taking even data sets their
proposed approach species gene number
heuristic approach was later described
than et al provided heuristic species tree under criterion
however no exact solutions criterion exist
paper provide notion first described
then present exact solutions linear algorithm dynamic algorithm finding optimal species tree set gene tree under criterion
our solutions based two central species tree graph set species clusters amount between set gene species tree obtained simple within species tree
accuracy computational solutions demonstrate allow analysis data sets analysis large numbers data sets those involved simulation studies
given data solutions considered
computational our solutions allow solutions
but not least exact solutions allow us study properties criterion species tree
both exact solutions
data set yeast data set large number data sets using
each data set our method species tree at most few produced very accurate species show
case data set provide tree different one proposed authors discuss tree
yeast data set obtain tree one proposed authors well other studies
addition quality species our method them one advantage our method used multiple species tree study scenarios within each them
utility yeast data sets
further data set how possible gene events using scenarios other methods
using data sets study statistical consistency well convergence rate criterion
also show may sufficient consider only set clusters gene practice may much smaller than set all clusters species thus further reduction time
present example certain cases only gene tree clusters may result species tree under
computational our methods properties criterion makes our methods particularly large data sets
