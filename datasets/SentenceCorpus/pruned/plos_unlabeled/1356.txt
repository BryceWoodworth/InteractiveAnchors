here use computational modeling approach experimentally measured effects physiological targets
then study effects cell dynamics computational models
model predicts changes action potential at different cycle consistent observed
model predicts at physiological
model suggests increased when levels high while
simulations predict effects observed mechanisms
simulations also effects not sufficient explain increased risk

introduction
past studies suggested independent risk factor dependent
since differences appear time effects been
studies found no difference but versus under
long reported had higher risk first event between years
moreover findings observed more than percent occur
known one way functional physiological changes via regulation
may then into
receptor transcription factor binding region genes leading regulation gene expression
example d been found receptor
genomic action requires several before effects observed
addition genomic pathway may activation protein kinase leading transcription factor activation well activation membrane bound
recent studies demonstrated may also activity directly via pathway
kinase leads no activation
no leads residues underlying current
2 current no via dependent pathway
regulation i i leads action potential
level reported however levels
than likely role
through cycle
reported level phase phase
was recently shown et al increases i current through no pathways i
result effects
recently experiments suggested effects against
experiments show had compared
also experiments shown
effects result human gene underlying current directly binding current
showed increases rate current
they also showed presence more
group proposed may increasing sensitivity via interaction
because concentration not constant through cycle but rather phase level 1 phase effects sensitivity within range may through cycle
although studies shown effects question whether normal sufficient account during cycle not known
effects physiological well
some studies do report dynamic during cycle related changes risk
other studies also suggest importance increases risk
other data not found during specific cycle
et al found does not significantly change through cycle however c reduced phase after
study during cycle observed c did not during cycle but c was more phase application
both experimental data suggest both than more likely develop dependent
especially increased risk response
major specifically determine relationship between since system complex
order risk particular parameter case relevant specific effect must studied without other system
computational approach
present study focus effects targets
use models effects measured experimentally then test changes specifically within complex cellular
use model make predictions about effects physiological specific parameters
some recent experimental studies functional effects function range higher than physiological concentration
critical because via effects 2 current
although high may relevant during recent study showed at 1 did not significant effects i i
our model simulations observed through cycle both cell
simulations also predict effects
