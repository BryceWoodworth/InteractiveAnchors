study investigate influence matrix interactions context
do our mathematical model against empirical data within framework density matrix different environments explore matrix achieve effects
model predicts specific matrix normal experiment
then explore matrix alignment key factor cell
also effects matrix cell demonstrate growth at high matrix but effect at lower
our results discussed context tested
introduction
matrix major component region central role including new growth cancer
large body research understanding how interactions impact processes
results active role biochemical signals cell
area target
cells them signals their environment
one receptor various proteins
cells directly through formula
biochemical signals within cell affect binding cellular matrix
form directly
cell used cell
cell
via binding sites phenomenon contact key role new growth
physical properties density affect cell behavior also area current
popular protein experiments contains growth factors all provide environment cell
experiments cells increasing cellular formation cell networks
cells properties example their
cells including cells increasing therefore results increased cell
measurements function density show positive relationship between two properties
density increases so does matrix
two findings not experimental study also shows cell matrix density increases
moreover matrices higher density less cell experiments cells demonstrate called matrix
thus via properties influence interactions cell cell formation networks
understanding how individual cells biochemical signals only part whole
processes also require
addition cues cells they also signals each other
during new growth cells each other through called order cells must
process
during cell clusters often
cells also ability condition specific proteins
addition cells components further they during
response cells direction applied
cells form cell
more experimental data component processes
work our cellular model against empirical measurements
then use our model investigate effect focus mechanisms cell
show matrix density network
matrix density likelihood
model predicts optimal density network formation suggests matrix mechanism
also identify unique matrix density normal show within density range similar density found
finally effects matrix cell demonstrate growth at high but effect at lower
based findings suggest discuss several tested
