alternative gene both processes protein
recent examples shown sequence changes introduced may those introduced
addition two processes correlated at genomic large gene
all together data strongly suggest both result between their effects
here tested extent respect various protein characteristics
per gene even when different gene functions sequence
contrast two processes appear independent their influence variation expression
further detailed comparison effect sequence changes both alternative gene protein structure particular size types sequence
find general alternative protein sequence structure more way than gene
our results between at genomic level their impact at protein level shows little no terms effects protein sequence structure function
discuss possible order gene family selection environment
introduction
alternative gene two main protein impact protein sequence structure function
several recent studies point direct between
there some cases where alternative one similar gene another
example factor at least two functional human differ amino rna recognition
no instead there gene changes those found human
further changes introduced sequence need stable functional
indeed structural studies shown between gene tend at sequence where they less at
will apply source changes thus may introduce certain degree similarity between sequence changes associated
finally recent studies shown correlated scale small gene tend more genes alternative than do large
findings together examples structural constraints at genomic level suggest sources functional
genes would not need produce additional form
here first tested between respect sequence function gene expression
second studied hypothesis at protein structure level asked what extent introduce changes sequence their nature effect structure function
end comparison effects human proteins
cases two processes result different protein different functional
finding while consistent different molecular mechanisms underlying both observed at genomic level
discuss some possible
