protein dynamics often described free energy considered function one few reaction
however number experiments models show when reaction protein dynamics
question whether used description dynamics
here construct reaction long model protein
dynamics while dynamics same reaction
show higher free energy reaction more dynamics become when
results suggest whether dynamics depends chosen reaction
protein described free energy function reaction
reaction even though they might based physical often hence show dynamics
introduction
free energy one small number often used describe properties complex systems very large number
studies protein important case where type been introduced number been used
protein then described free energy
dynamics characterized means time formula where d
single reaction dynamics free energy free energy function based free energy
good reaction
many cases standard variables not good reaction because they do not thus may complexity latter
number methods construct good reaction been suggested
one derive describe system dynamics reaction
contains memory kernel leads dynamics
characterized mean than formula formula
dynamics case one memory kernel not since requires solution
memory correlation functions proteins was observed experimentally
question whether dynamics proteins described simple free energy often if one use more state space networks
here show if reaction then dynamics while same dynamics
