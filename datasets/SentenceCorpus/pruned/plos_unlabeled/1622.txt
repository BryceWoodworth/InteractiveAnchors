increased effective connectivity pathway connectivity
moreover analysis between processes revealed how effective connectivity along pathway importance
findings provide novel perspective how connectivity between predicts potential new targets
introduction
disease neurons activity studies shown at key feature when at level activity local field several key nodes
nodes include brain where after observed primary associated activity following power moreover recent report shown at similar findings patients
how leads power unknown
recent work revealed after loss but not after receptor here examine whether changes effective connectivity between nodes network account following loss
test hypothesis used dynamic
approach allows one distributed underlying activity
framework brain data making about parameters models using bayesian approach
range models been developed various output data features
current event related state responses
current paper based designed data features
using data multiple asked whether changes neural produce observed model models using data
specifically used neural models main cell types at each
neural models describe dynamics terms average states over populations neurons
inference effective connectivity differences observed between control cases was based estimates connectivity synaptic parameters
using estimates sensitivity changes particular identify may represent targets
measures functional connectivity been applied previously examine signal between nodes network
measures between between models while functional connectivity effective connectivity measures some aspects likelihood models bayesian underlying different between functional connectivity effective connectivity analysis time et al used term effective connectivity define interactions could explain observed using minimum simple model
what follows minimum model approach using key elements known interactions
our model predicts output where assume observed responses interactions among populations sources known
point analyses effective connectivity paper end point classical functional connectivity observed
other words place special how functional connectivity terms particular model interactions
what follows approach when applied system
