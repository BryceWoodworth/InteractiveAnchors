due recent experimental including other methods interaction detection network data available
major however levels noise
example thought positive rate could high percent negative rate may range percent percent
experiments levels noise
present novel technique confidence levels interactions networks obtained experimental studies
use predicting new interactions thus future biological experiments
technique first best network model networks graphs
our approach percent sensitivity percent
use confidence physical interactions human network
using our approach predict interactions human network significant protein pairs common terms
moreover significant our predicted interactions database
data methods available
introduction
networks used model natural studied computational systems biology
nodes networks represent genes proteins between nodes interactions between corresponding
interactions could many different types including functional genetic physical interactions
understanding complex networks fundamental issue systems biology
particular importance interaction networks
networks nodes proteins two nodes if corresponding proteins
networks give new into function individual proteins protein cellular complex system
techniques protein complex identification amount experimental data many organisms
however data produced techniques very high levels
negative rates range percent percent negative rates percent percent
positive rates could high percent experiments they could high percent
thus level noise networks confidence each interaction essential task
two recent studies provided two high quality data sets
et al defined number times two proteins observed together relative their frequency data set
they use not only direct but also relationships
two proteins each identified third protein used
et al used machine learning methods including bayesian networks decision define confidence potential interactions
based direct observations
they used markov clustering algorithm define protein
data sets produced two groups very different thought contain many
two data sets were into one set experimentally based primary data using system
using set they showed new data set more accurate than original individual sets defined using small scale experimental methods
original interactions two studies general interaction data they being low confidence
their metric they new interactions were not among original interactions produced set interactions accuracy accuracy small scale experiments
paper use high confidence data set test our approach
recent years several random graph models been proposed model random graphs same degree distribution data graphs random graphs models
technique presented paper one first use network model networks other than just data
demonstrate graph model used confidence levels known interactions networks predicting novel ones
apply our technique data sets negative interactions
new approach compared existing network techniques section
