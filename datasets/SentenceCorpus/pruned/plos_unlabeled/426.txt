introduction
at species molecular levels
at molecular level constraints system often require changes its components
most example pairs rna secondary structures
between pairs different species order
changes amino residues also been investigated
typically studies one family sequences examined between sequences
some applied different including correlation information between distributions
studies demonstrate sequence protein protein interactions structure single proteins
addition direct physical interactions amino residues reported subject functional constraints proteins
major many lack information
sequences same level may either few independent early correlated changes along multiple
rna structure prediction many authors extended markov process sequence pairs
however direct application models protein due large number parameters amino pairs
problem was amino sets protein each species size amino groups
yet standard sequence set empirical models available
all previous studies protein target few proteins protein domains family domain family proteins
protein sequences their information allows us perform all known protein
will give information among all protein domains provide about their
propose general model requires states prior knowledge about interactions only one free parameter
sequence two sites markov process
model two sites
alternative model obtained model independent rate matrix over single changes
apply model all position pairs all known protein domain database
large number domain pairs highly domains same proteins protein same functions
moreover demonstrate tendency spatial important sites their proteins
