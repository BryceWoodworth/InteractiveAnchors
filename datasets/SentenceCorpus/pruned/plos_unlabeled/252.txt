introduction
pattern formation depends interactions cells factors control
most fundamental processes involve spatial into domains studied well
cells well itself family local cells process involves
cells first regions increased cell interactions then properties cell cell molecules
follows at sites both
certain processes cancer cells structures become more
contrast example process cells out independent form structures
others second include formation social into
both continuous models been used previously analyze wide range pattern formation behaviors both using reaction
models describe behaviors interactions individual biological organisms cells proteins etc they often applied events where small number elements large impact system
previous study presented biological model cells derived
model was based physical notion individual free point point at formation patterns observed cells
simulations distribution relative size values when appropriate cell behavioral parameters were chosen patterns were robust against small values
moreover patterns were when cell density expression molecular factors represented model were their system
model each cells each core subset molecules they was represented single common
motion cell was random but cell was also presence produced cells according set rules involving
latter turn were produced according reaction network structure was suggested experiments
ability model et al both quantitative aspects formation distribution suggested core genetic network cell behavioral mechanism biological might sufficient account pattern formation cell system corresponding features development
however model biological several important ways
cells small them less than cell
those up their area but do not cells
therefore situation model et al does not involve cells at particular sites cells
representation cells common
not simply molecular indeed form same linear scale cells molecular could considered molecules
dynamics continuous represented same size cell
whereas model et al made assumption cells their motion when they levels does not measurements cells actually increase their motion they finite probability
despite model et al was unknown whether its aspects them more assumptions would lead results
therefore designed more model each one
cells new model extended objects change up into third dimension
model cells less than cell without regions not upon
finally two different size used cell molecular dynamics
found not only does model experimental data model et al but additional features system well
moreover potential dynamic properties process not seen simulations not being basis existing experimental data were simulations using new model therefore provided further empirical tests
