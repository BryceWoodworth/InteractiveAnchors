many cellular systems rely ability spatial concentration direct cell
accuracy process limited stochastic concentration signal signaling components
here use information theory determine optimal source presence noise
minimum amount information needed between signal achieve accuracy
show more accurate requires greater information
also demonstrate information improve
compare optimal signaling existing experimental measurements models
there good quantitative between optimal response when no assumption made about existing source observed experimental response cells
contrast measured response d cells optimal prior knowledge example through given direction
our results demonstrate different observed classes responses cells optimal under information assumptions
introduction
recently there been research critical role random cellular signaling systems
stochastic found signaling molecules well components
they because small number molecules involved signaling play significant gene regulatory networks well signal pathways
cellular signaling networks requires mechanisms effects noise
however questions how evaluate performance cellular decision-making systems
how well does signaling network cell make decisions based signaling cues available
made parameters structure network
how used
here argue rate theory information theory used evaluate systems
application information theory study biology been under way some time attention
however full utility biological signaling systems general not been because difficulty information general biological systems
here use rate theory study performance cost general spatial mechanisms similar those found many cells including
rate theory provides bounds rate at information must through system achieve given performance criterion
our results demonstrate depending prior knowledge cell about its environment different optimal strategies exist
furthermore show differences observed behaviors cells various efficient decision-making processes
