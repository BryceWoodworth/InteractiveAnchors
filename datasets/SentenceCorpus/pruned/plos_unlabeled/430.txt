protein kinase key role following
experiments suggest synaptic changes events between states
biochemical network involving its protein signaling been synaptic state form
however still whether experimental lead corresponding between two states models network
present detailed biochemical model protein signaling
previously shown two stable states level exist at concentration high system highly state
show here increased activity at 2 lead up state
if protein activity at lower 2 levels than kinase activity
finally shown system results outcomes response dependent
shows protein network account both through due its synaptic changes
introduction
synaptic thought learning memory but mechanisms changes synaptic over time still
experiments shown how synaptic increased neurons firing rate firing potential
experiments models one several aspects
however models us about biochemical mechanisms synaptic changes
question mechanisms at biochemical level been another research work early work
models at biochemical level describe reactions proteins density
proteins form network positive feedback potentially provide several stable states two case means changes
hence models similar binary two stable states up state high state low
idea binary recent experiments
one proposed positive feedback involves protein kinase system
activation 2 binding its
at domain occurs after binding active after
turn long density bound state where multiple protein therefore potentially cell
direct receptor active function
network involving particularly terms learning memory since receptor dependent requires activation potentially expressed level number both
however role remains
finally there experimental evidence proteins associated activity
multiple mechanisms expression likely present different regions focus here above been shown apply
modeling studies shown system including associated pathways could range including level necessary changes
models two states two stable levels protein given concentration highly state
transition up state could large increase concentration
however transition could only occurs under conditions example concentration below level
furthermore not been considered how biochemical network models response experimental known synaptic been shown rely kinase activation
et al experimental results using model system protein network but model does not exhibit
other studies biochemical signal pathways including showed receptor activity synaptic function
however were not investigated models they do not show
paper consider model protein interactions associated through protein 1
first study properties respect levels activity
conditions system allows
then demonstrate ability system perform response
system pairs given time show short positive time up state short negative time lead up state
demonstrate furthermore model experimental outcomes
finally consider transition behavior response
