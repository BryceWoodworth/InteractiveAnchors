generated statistical framework robust uncertainty their utility
many settings require measures over large regions mean within region populations under different levels risk
existing approaches provide local uncertainty predictions at each but not been uncertainty over large due series fundamental computational constraints

new approach model p robust estimates mean at any level spatial
model used provide estimates populations at risk under three along measures uncertainty
previously computational study how approaches at disease extended provide measures appropriate
introduction
risk spatial distribution relation underlying populations required support health decision-making at local global scales
theory increasing recognition importance robust uncertainty all recent years new use special family linear models known generally bayesian framework
models take point observations disease generate continuous at across
most advantage disease its uncertainty
sparse often data predict disease across wide regions results risk level uncertainty function density quality sample size available data underlying spatial disease question
approaches allow sources uncertainty output predicting probability distribution at each interest
where predictions made small uncertainty distributions will central where uncertainty large they will more
techniques been used generate robust risk well range other at scales global
some studies extended variation through space also include temporal dimension disease risk over time well space
models over even relatively small
not only matrix required generate predictions at each individual compared methods but cost must many times because prediction uncertainty many at each
disease models over large therefore tend via complete up predictive each
allows computational task into many small more
approach appropriate measures local set each predictive distribution statistics mean range percent uncertainty information each individual considered
there often need evaluate disease across spatial regions temporal both
may compare mean between example measure mean between end policy change
addition models used estimate derived population regions at different levels risk disease cases expected within individual function underlying exist only over
not possible however construct distributions using approach
estimate mean region made up multiple uncertainty estimate correlation between all region must known
approach each independent its any spatial temporal correlation
account correlation between leads uncertainty especially over large regions
solution problem above simulation simulation all appropriate spatial temporal correlation between them
set values then any way used input derived will appropriate predictive distributions
simple local simulation fundamental computational necessary no into tasks each
thus far any use disease evaluation over very large despite health importance measures
where examples simulation disease exist they tend either over very small spatial regions simply larger regions into smaller more
paper use new approximate algorithm simulation first time uncertainty over space time global scale disease model
how approach allows uncertainty predictions at scales at decisions usually made
then model estimate second particular populations at risk under different p transmission
estimates form fundamental metric at levels also been used distributions human populations disease provide predicted changes under change scenarios
range techniques been used estimate including use other models risk relation underlying population distributions
studies uncertainty estimates however resulting estimates presented point values no uncertainty
here use simulation framework generate predictive distributions under conditions low high stable transmission within each uncertainty estimates statistical framework
estimates presented full paper making them available any support theoretical applied health applications
