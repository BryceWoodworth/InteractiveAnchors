binding depends upon 2 activation
binding occurs within network protein where there between along between along
using models when effects
study uses two models predict levels binding 2 activation
one model while other only one one
simulations comparing models show predictions binding more consistent experimental values
furthermore values predicted model greater than those values predicted model
increases larger than relative increase potential interactions model versus model
binding mechanism depends specifically
introduction
2 binding
underlying process factors time
factors include properties activation 2
because proteins highly exists between along between regulatory proteins along between following formation
thus processes at molecular level
evidence shows 2 binding at one influence processes at regions activation determine level generated
most models do not explicitly consider spatial properties may influence
models both spatial temporal variables some provide either spatial predictions conditions temporal predictions state without any spatial
contrast few recent models predict both spatial temporal behavior some simulations between binding
potential mechanism results between following binding
previous models 2 regulatory cycle 2 activation along physiological
components particularly important because regions 2 binding determine spatial distribution bound
current study model regulatory proteins along contrast prior studies
how two spatial temporal 2 binding binding region
spatial temporal aspects may behavior between percent
significant do not while
moreover recent measurements improve estimates about rate functions depending extent between may affect
within system however structure dynamics
study multiple models but different model examine structure 2
consistent previous models occur along current models
assumption system linear describe interactions between
at core each model cycle regulatory model control binding through 2
initial model between four different models
options only one model predictions were consistent range values
therefore focus comparing model model
study specifically consider feedback between activation binding
thus any differences simulation predictions between models depend differences between model
simulation results show additional interactions model lead greater binding compared model
increases larger than predicted additional model
results there mechanism dependent upon structure
specifically structure further binding without any feedback mechanisms activation
additional studies other mechanisms via feedback pathways activation binding our others
findings current study however certain greater binding may important mechanism performance
aspects work been previously
