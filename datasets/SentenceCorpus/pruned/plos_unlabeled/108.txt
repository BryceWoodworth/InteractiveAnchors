type target also significant each studied
introduction
growth new critical physiological process growth during
may while cancer targets
expression suggests work may also relevant development system
our goal propose effective using accurate detailed computational models growth factors involved
study predict three methods same result distinct outcomes one methods more effective than others
thus identification target must rational design obtain characteristics potential
addition drug example expression level critical factor impact
growth factor family critical
vegf increases cell
increases cells
multiple vegf two most human vegf vegf
both vegf receptor signals
vegf also matrix
binding sites vegf so vegf may both
there thus two pathways vegf its signaling binding directly binding vegf
vegf only form directly
vegf interaction thus particular value target because vegf vegf been identified signaling may while normal levels physiological vegf signaling
previous work developed computational models vegf interactions cell previously experimental data estimate rate vegf
showed sufficient account observed effects vegf multiple cell types our model distinct vegf binding signaling effects each cell types
addition used model between molecular mechanisms action demonstrated under not vegf binding
here model molecular interactions vegf family its predict behavior system including well multiple cell types parameters
three methods vegf interaction here
first expression may use other methods protein cells
second protein vegf binding site vegf binding receptor
example growth factor 2
2
2 here contains only binding site does not
protein been used vegf binding
alternative would vegf itself
third may interaction between vegf signaling receptor but
may using previously characterized vegf binding but
each three strategies been demonstrated vegf signaling here predict their
first computational model our knowledge include interactions vegf family their explicitly
model all receptor interactions allows us examine both behavior system
all parameters model been obtained previously experimental data
analysis parameters shows vegf interactions than process so assumed fast construct model cells vegf into space vegf binding cell
parameters under here also into space cell area area
changes parameters would result changes parameters model
results presented here therefore but model may applied other
primary signaling receptor vegf first analyze results model cells but not effect considered later
system state vegf cells cells resulting through space
one three at time time vegf binding
vegf vegf binding taken vegf signaling
