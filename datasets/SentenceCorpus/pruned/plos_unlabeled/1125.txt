been suggested stochastic
however out energy provided single only formula formula much less than observed step size
here propose simple physical model explain constant but at same time contact produce potential therefore additional
random potential particular direction elements
our model existence well between step also predicts step statistics depend position
our predictions found consistent available data including suggest how could used study physical structure
novel prediction relation will become at very low
our model two main constant constant between contact potential
all apply
following model et al assume each complex set protein energy available formula
protein fixed sites
when formula through membrane its site next site
at all energy necessary its next site
at low but formula so system remains set
may among but since there several assume constant time
under cannot at level single pair but must at global level interaction
there contact between
may contact between proteins but also contact proteins each
there may other contact well
assume experimental observations
therefore all contact potential formula
since at molecular scale its stochastic subject random
another potential source noise applied individual due nature
however presence multiple independent noise out
under combined influence applied contact potential continuous random potential model following formula formula total via protein where potential formula contact term formula noise formula where formula related via formula
experiments
assume between compared time
