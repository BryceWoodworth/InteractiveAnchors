introduction
information processing associated higher brain functions out large scale neural networks
significant theoretical computational been over years understand behavior networks
while any modeling most relevant physical characteristics networks certain hypothesis usually order complexity problem
particular computational models large scale networks make use assumption
population neurons exhibit similar behavior
large scale network then defined their
order describe dynamics further assumptions
instance neurons may nature their may temporal their activity considered dynamics large network
small neural network properties will show very well dynamics neural model
amount work been understanding behavior neural networks when some assumptions
many studies consider either network connectivity give special attention state network
among first one may consider studies who introduced order parameter degree function frequency distribution
more generally et al derived stability stability condition state arbitrary network
recently et al derive similar conditions connectivity well
another direction behavior networks involves state along
approaches only when state not very strong
other hand there exists another class approaches based mean field theory
mean field approaches neural activity since their basic assumption given network hence
other behaviors far phase instance also require current approaches
first do so include higher mean field network dynamics phase space
latter approach et al identified network behavior but been limited situations networks models
while true strong assumptions common network modeling assumptions network dynamics usually made limit network dynamics small range
reduced small scale network model large scale network simulation dynamic
here less importance find reduced description neural rather more population model able major dynamic behaviors parameter observed total population neurons
here also include more dynamics behavior since novel small scale network level may occur need reduced population model
paper approach et al towards more network including networks well more models behavior
our reduced neural population models not only account correct mean field original networks but also most important temporal features its dynamics
way complex scale become available simulations large scale neural networks at low computational cost
first main features dynamic behavior neural population both
then using techniques derive low representation network dynamics show main features neural behavior well dynamics few
two different models network neurons network neurons discussed
