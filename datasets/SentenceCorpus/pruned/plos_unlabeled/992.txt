our findings therefore suggest system at more through practice variables
introduction
despite research formation human hand basic mechanisms control underlying even
various studies proposed human at either dynamic
studies suggested basic elements combined
account human their ability new
properties were power
constraints were shown both respect perception
studies also showed power at constant there evidence significant role human motion respect
argue may provide more representation complex
show under dynamic involving use either
their properties even when subjects required control computer their data
recent studies humans used complex after practice sequential
ability different constraints modeling human could lead further
representation may underlying formation
here hypothesis was experimentally tested using made two
our choice source data was underlying activity neurons
predictions both power model single
predictions two models was described
version our findings was presented at at computational control at
