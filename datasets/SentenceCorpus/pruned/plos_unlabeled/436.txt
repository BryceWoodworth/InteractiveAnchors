attention important complex environments where signals
attention increases both power local field within field object
however mechanisms activity if at all input signals not well
propose statistics across neural populations
using models neurons show how signals based population response statistics
results give important between neural attention tasks where attention known performance
further they show how responses not
introduction
past work both human subjects focused neural attention
attention firing rate input output gain neurons visual response so relevant stimuli region
also when stimuli field frequency components local field responses increase
field potential likely correlated network activity simulations neurons
attention thought influence networks involved
correlated network cells making activity efficient signal
would allow objects increase responses compared objects
contrast role signal neural populations dynamics
tasks where attention performance typically involve between different signals visual cues different
although there large number studies how generated networks neurons mechanisms signal three aspects
first relation between gain both
second temporal relation between network time signal often
third firing may due increased population activity
popular framework neural number produced single population neurons information about signal
however often show factor close even
performance based
certain situations factors much less than 1 observed visual
case if high probability response relevant input signal then signal estimated small error
addition just single during input also binary
study model frequency simple population neurons
show population statistics improve signal over range stimuli through reduced
way propose between task performance found behavioral experiments
our results both distinct previously described network behavior temporal
