introduction
rna genes regulatory structures been shown both highly highly genome
one theory many part regulatory systems
recently several about rna genes motifs using comparative been
there potentially many unknown structures still hidden genomes
been shown alignment requires information about secondary structure when sequence similarity below percent
mutations change primary sequence without structure
algorithm rna sequences principle applied
however algorithm too high even few short sequences
two sequences length time complexity memory complexity heuristics therefore needed before algorithms rna sequences become fast useful
was first algorithm
simple matrices
had three length alignment could not than maximum length difference between two being was limited could only structures
second version algorithm uses combination energy model two sequences
also uses constraints but structures
algorithm was used one
two types heuristics very popular
methods use sequence similarity limit search space alignment must contain
length short called full sequences
methods require sequences before structure predicted not methods they alignment
uses limit structures found comparative algorithms
popular method use probabilities found limit base pairs conserved structure
methods methods using taken where alignment
one example combination methods
some methods use both heuristics
methods alignment prediction rna sequences into two methods probabilistic methods
methods based free energy
based physical model how different elements rna structure free energy
parameters found experimentally estimated multiple
probabilistic models usually based stochastic context free see introduction
methods include
stochastic context free parameters estimated multiple
each methods uses different heuristics
previous version uses alignment length local number ways
uses based using hidden markov model
number potential base pairs only using base pairs probability above given
uses similar strategy but further base pairs
uses short normal sequence
uses n 1 best predicted structures n 2 best limit combined alignment structure prediction
paper dynamic matrix introduced new heuristic algorithm
all its dynamic any does not above threshold
similar one heuristics used
advantage method compared methods used when there not sequence similarity make necessary
advantage compared methods comparative information step
shown leads increase while algorithm its good performance
increase makes studies like much more
method simple general
should therefore possible use many other methods available rna sequences
feature dynamic method may used any algorithm using dynamic
addition been significantly
up algorithm points now also used lower memory during
during algorithm more information needed
limit memory during step used
step all points conserved structure then used structure into
structures then
structures usually than full structure memory reduced
use method increases time algorithm but not much since
addition energy model been well
consistent way
also more base pairs
lead better structure predictions
