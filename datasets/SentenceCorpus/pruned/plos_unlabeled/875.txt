study various parameters protein levels cells
achieve goal model was at state continuous at different growth rates data were compared
protein were highly variable among proteins but also given gene between different growth conditions
modeling cellular processes combined data modeling approach both rates estimated each protein each growth condition
estimated rates strongly between proteins were tested their biological through statistical relevant parameters amino bias
rates were not constant all growth conditions were growth rate more efficient at low growth rate but higher rate protein
estimated protein underlying importance protein at low growth rates
regulation protein level was through regulatory complex control depending protein growth conditions
modeling approach protein rates estimated two biological parameters difficult determine experimentally generally
method now extended other environments other
introduction
systems biology data different levels genome
approach at data through computational mathematical models so biological systems whole
integration results itself
literature usually two approaches tools does not often provide correct two datasets
now only few researchers yeast been results typically revealed between those two datasets
between protein levels control protein et al
involved protein level control but generally studied at level specific molecular mechanisms not at genome scale
although analysis allows experimentally determined various technique been only used almost s
protein stability also influence protein level correlation between protein
however protein stability studied at genome scale data only available s
finally rate protein due protein cellular growth also potentially involved protein level but physical phenomenon generally
more generally even if protein rate all influence protein levels parameters not usually studied
role each parameter whole cellular adaptation process not been not known parameter if control constant not when environmental conditions
aim study was control protein level taking into account all parameters control model
achieve analyses were performed cells same
data were available corresponding was performed
whole protein related processes including rate protein were since biological data were obtained at state protein levels were
modeling approach protein estimated relative all various parameters protein control
