fundamental problem understanding how memory ability information at like networks
most likely mechanism network effort
yet despite almost work networks not
particular there still two questions
first how networks exhibit firing observed experimentally during memory tasks
second how many under conditions
here answer both questions neural network each other
using analysis derive description networks
description follows firing exist only if number neurons involved memory large
same analysis also shows number network scales number result been suggested simple models but shown ones
both predictions using simulations large networks neurons
introduction
critical component any cognitive system memory mechanism information about past events information at later times
without mechanism even simple tasks whether after report would
although not known how information neural systems very natural way through networks
networks events world stable patterns activity brain so at pattern activity at current time other brain know about what past
there now experimental evidence networks temporal
theoretical well how networks could networks at least principle
all needed increase among neurons
if increase large then each active without input thus events past
while basic theory networks been known some time past principle understanding how could networks been difficult
because original model several important neurons did not when memory was neurons much higher than observed experimentally memory tasks there was no state no state all neurons at low rates
most problems been
first was was synaptic using neurons either then setting any weights
second network low firing rate was appropriate
third problem no was either making stochastic input
there still two fundamental open questions
one how understand highly firing observed experimentally memory tasks question important because firing thought play critical role both how fast out ability networks perform statistical inference
though because out synaptic neurons number per
because high connectivity observed mean synaptic much larger than neurons should
moreover out et al even models produce firing neurons neurons still tend more than neurons experiments
several studies problem either directly
most them however did not investigate network parameters its size
so although parameters were found activity was not clear how those parameters should scale size network increased values
two did investigate firing was possible only if small neurons was involved each only if level was very small
although there been no direct measurements level during activity at least our knowledge experiments temporal suggest much larger than one used models
should point out though model et al only one neurons at least neurons
second open question what networks
how many different single network
critical understanding highly memory observed
simple models answer shown work number classical network about times number neurons
more networks answer also known
however even more studies biological at least one connectivity was all all rather than sparse neurons were binary there was no firing rate state was higher than observed experimentally level was very small
here answer both show networks neurons how firing
our analysis uses relatively standard techniques requires only one neurons network
given assumption first show neurons only if level above some threshold although feature our model neurons more than neurons
then show maximum number our network number per result consistent models discussed above
predictions simulations networks neurons
