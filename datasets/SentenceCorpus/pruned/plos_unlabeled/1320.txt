introduction
family functional advantage over its
most proteins active state not but large t 1
while stable like similar rates they at rates up than under highly conditions
addition rates leading
therefore functional advantage derived not only its very but also its local events would
thus evolution generated order its functional under conditions
cost form loss stability active state relative state
however also large then so

given its stability much effort focused its mechanism
showed over its factors greater than
both domains high
into suggested role domain critical step involving domain while individual domains relatively
studies were consistent hypothesis
distribution differ at domain significant increases low
major component domain domain only between two domains
structure exists only among its
area domain correlated rate four stable both its early
another domain component domain unique stable part active site
more stable turn was consistent pathway where c its domain early
despite much still lack global especially at high
protein researchers often value analysis
studies involve protein experiments investigate after making mutations
large numbers structure transition state mechanism proposed
rates make value analysis
alternative investigate pathway order explain previous experiments new ones
molecular dynamics simulations structural temporal protein but their results must experimentally
since rates proteins typically very under physiological conditions very high required into range required computational analysis
there was significant high real proteins under physiological conditions
been field using 2 model system shown well experimental values were even able predict
further work other proteins multiple groups simulations useful protein at while well experiments

critical step simulations generated
because experimentally through its identification used both predictive
various methods been used past into conformational clustering methods
conformational clustering often c while structures generated using properties secondary structure
here report results multiple simulations out at high order mechanism
due robustness same obtained using either conformational clustering methods
pathway well previously described experiments provides previous models role domain
addition performed similar simulations goal understanding observed experimental differences
through novel method simulations show significantly more than experimental results
finally domain both proteins during propose mechanism how
