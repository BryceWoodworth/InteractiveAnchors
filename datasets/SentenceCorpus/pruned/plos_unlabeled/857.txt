designed its size several features larger proteins
although system been investigated experimentally its mechanism not yet
indeed some experiments suggest behavior while others point presence
work show results simulation used detailed model system
model although simulation quality similar those analysis long molecular dynamics
demonstrated approach smaller system
model predicts time observed experimentally due presence
state only percent at but
instead structures state
model also predicts presence state at formula structure strongly
state explain formula formula
structures two most stable experiments protein
our work shows using molecular dynamics possible construct model experimental data
introduction
understanding protein central issue molecular biology modeling useful also field
direct comparison between simulations experiments requires both accurate description system sample space
order molecular dynamics necessary use very large distributed sampling technique
system almost theoretical designed structure
structure core
secondary structure elements include short formula at
mechanism system been studied several experimental techniques
show behavior transition at time s at
more complex behavior presence formula core even more
experiments show but large negative formula formula suggest those residues might more
also correlation experiments cannot terms simple formation been proposed
modeling been studied using several different approaches
particular description been studied molecular dynamics
extended structure formula mean 2 reference structure obtained after simulation
relatively high predicted
other studies suggested even if rather small system statistical convergence simulation may require much simulation times
was studied transition sampling transition sampling
was also investigated two us using bias approach different variables among molecular dynamics simulations performed at same
using method possible explore number
since all simulations performed at same number does not system size like approach

using was possible together two their b using field less than simulation only
recently method was also used mechanism reactions
simulations biological systems after necessary relevant their probability rates among them
several methods been developed
methods advantage complex dynamics space markov process among finite number states
they molecular dynamics but they cannot applied if system under action bias
paper present method allows statistics bias detailed model complex process
approach presented here at same information simulation one obtain analysis long several
method space defined set variables assumed describe relevant system
variables not ones used simulation chosen formula
selected rate model following three
analysis performed extended space each during dynamics reference structure close space
next population each simulations using analysis method bias
finally model rates among
transition rates assumed form introduced
depend free energy difference between determined matrix formula relative position
only free parameter model formula free
following
formula estimated likelihood
model manner designed long time scale dynamics system
used example process
advantage using accuracy estimated free energy at transition state regions
approach first
system simple allow results against long standard simulation
system model accuracy observed
same approach then applied
model allows process rates experiment etc good available experimental data
markov analysis several sets identified
states considered process
at two main clusters present population percent percent
most state its structural properties very close
second most significant amount secondary structure but formula state
its distance reduced
presence system explain some behavior observed experiments
structures most good states reported

using model experiment also
experimental results time s found
time determined towards state structure
times among all other clusters including between states state all time domain
thus time measured may not directly related transition if one transition random state
