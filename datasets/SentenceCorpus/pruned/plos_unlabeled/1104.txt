neural populations typically distribution
short time scales however distribution too describe analyze distributions
present alternative based account arbitrary distributions including negative distributions well second interactions
describe maximum models data derive makes possible arbitrary into arbitrary probability distribution
different structures model different processes also introduced
first apply models populations neurons correlated input show best provide information about functional connectivity neurons using
then apply new method data were using
find distributions negative provide appropriate stochastic model distributions rather than variables distribution often used normal distribution
structure distributions provides evidence common input all stimulus neurons
finally show models used evaluate neural distributions information measures
models not only class models distributions but those models understand functional
introduction
so far still unknown statistics analysis order understand neural
one approach analyze neural populations
responses populations neurons even when same stimulus presented between usually correlated at least neurons
noise been subject number studies
computational however studies typically assume noise
thus correlated rates generally normal distributions specific matrix all linear
long time high firing rates average number large central limit theorem apply normal distribution good approximation distributions
several experimental findings however suggest processing information take place time scales involving only
normal distribution no
its continuous whereas empirical distributions real tend positive
normal distribution order positive probabilities negative values not
major issue low rates probability negative values would high
structure normal distribution always whereas data often show probability one
normal distribution second order only
although was shown interactions sufficient distributions cells cells there evidence significant higher order interactions
though not modeling alternative models been proposed previous studies distributed parameters higher order multiple interaction process model model
both models point processes
terms their distributions models special cases variables distribution first introduced presented matrix
similar normal distribution model also only
negative cannot represented
structure features like cannot
use class models distributions models
models based concept allow arbitrary distributions using set structures
they were also applied model distribution continuous
1 concept using data two real neurons
shows empirical distribution its two
distribution depends length time used here formula
case considered correlation at low higher than at high
called lower
shows normal distribution
other hand probabilities distribution well empirical distribution
paper follows
next section methods contains description normal distribution variables distribution approach model
section will also introduce novel
method novel result
will then describe computational model used generate data experimental analysis
section results models will applied data generated models neural populations data during visual memory task
models also investigated
paper approach
