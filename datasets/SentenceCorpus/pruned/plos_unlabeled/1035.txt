disordered regions various biological processes protein shown our study may subject future area
introduction
many proteins protein regions been shown disordered under they contain no very little structure
disordered proteins been found wide organisms their was shown increase complexity
comparative analysis functional disordered proteins suggest they cell involved transcription regulation cell also associated processes cell cycle control
certain properties functions them proteins structures
no unique structure state but upon binding their interaction
conformational changes upon binding proteins regions much larger than those proteins
disordered regions protein complex determined not only amino sequences but also
many different functions many different using same different
larger smaller compared proteins structure
typically amino low high well low sequence complexity high
intrinsic provides proteins response changes protein concentration
finally intrinsic mechanism regulation through many cellular processes
predictions proteins take into account features proteins been shown rather especially case large regions
according results best prediction groups identified percent disordered residues positive rates percent percent
prediction methods aim identify disordered regions through analysis amino sequences using properties amino evolutionary
protein interactions protein function biological role disordered proteins should also studied context
indeed disordered proteins into structures may occur upon binding their specific may allow disordered regions multiple interaction high low
moreover been shown binding mechanism whether binding occurs between depends structural characteristics properties degree
binding through provide advantage through mechanism
according mechanism reduction occurs when disordered protein binding up search specific targets
database continuous protein been protein data include short protein bound larger proteins
been binding hypothesis was analysis predicted
result structural differences same proteins different conditions functional states many protein were found able exist both disordered states
there continuous range between disordered proteins cases rather common proteins disordered but proteins disordered proteins some local
examples proteins disordered regions exhibit between binding been described literature previously
phenomenon functional importance many disordered regions remains
question further how much intrinsic do protein contain what its functional importance
answer questions examine observed predicted protein proteins using protein structures
structures conserved binding analysis introduced allow us changes interaction their functional importance
