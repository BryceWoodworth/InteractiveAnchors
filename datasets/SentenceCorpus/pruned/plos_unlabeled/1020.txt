recently proposed matrix system rules allows properties
matrix not only allows transcription state genome but also fundamental
furthermore key advantage matrix its ability existing matrix signaling metabolic networks
here demonstrate first time how matrix systems
analyze fundamental regulatory network matrix describe intrinsic properties
further use sampling evaluate e transcription state across subset all possible environments comparing our results gene expression data
finally present novel findings e including gene expression correlation matrix functional sets gene regulatory rules gene transcription may direct further experimental distributed structure contrast more metabolic networks
introduction
complex regulatory networks control transcription state genome functional activity cell
even relatively simple organisms networks regulatory interactions regulatory networks environmental stimuli
signals known impact transcription include source amino level
between environmental growth conditions through signaling networks resulting response primary interest study cellular systems
model organisms
describe functions genes associated regulatory proteins within given recently developed involving regulatory network matrix called
matrix components reactions within regulatory system
how using fundamental properties linear matrix allows properties prediction transcription state genome under any set environmental conditions
previously reported matrix distinct existing approaches use matrix matrix analyze gene expression data relationships gene transcription derived experiments how specific expression individual genes
way matrix previous approaches features including networks bayesian networks stochastic
regulatory rules matrix form fundamental matrix turn represent properties matrix contains
furthermore using approach discussed below matrix representation consistent thus related approaches using matrices represent reactions underlying metabolic signaling networks
approach only been applied relatively small systems including well small
although model systems been useful studies behavior matrix key question how approach scales larger more complex biological systems
here present first end matrix e regulatory relationships been previously characterized experimental data available
our knowledge work present here first model work us gain important into behavior matrix at larger scale associated well underlying biology e regulation
specifically derived directly previously developed model e regulatory rules were model
model initial matrix regulatory relationships defined behavior model been using analyses
our matrix analysis compared expression states predicted various environmental growth conditions available gene expression data
also fundamental related matrix complete e describe key properties including new about network structure
work understanding how e regulatory program functions whole utility regulatory network matrix regulatory systems at genome scale
