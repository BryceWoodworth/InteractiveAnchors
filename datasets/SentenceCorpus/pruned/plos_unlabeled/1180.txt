many studies disordered proteins based structural models protein data
yet nature models little into variation protein structure function under cellular environmental conditions
while computational disordered regions provides practical evidence intrinsic property proteins robustness disordered regions changes sequence environmental conditions not been studied
disordered regions same similar proteins studied their sensitivity changes protein sequence parameters experiments
observed changes existence position length disordered regions their structures depends changes amino sequence experiment
our study also general questions protein evolution regulation protein structure dynamics function via cellular environmental conditions
introduction
past significant been our understanding function disordered proteins
what set where every protein was unique stable structure out specific function into field where computational experimental approaches were developed combined disordered proteins understand their function mechanisms binding estimate their protein
analyses methods significant role process especially set statistical techniques
however despite previous questions about our view disordered proteins terms influence environmental conditions
here address questions observed disordered regions changes sequence environmental conditions used
recent studies effects environmental conditions regions intrinsic similar proteins
et al studied two yeast proteins different functional despite high sequence similarity suggested their functional differences different structures
although protein solution structure under physiological was found disordered low whereas had significant structure
structure at below c but was under low presence
et al reported conformational changes were observed structures human
at its structure density important region
at region disordered
our search protein data additional examples where changes experimental conditions strongly correlated presence disordered regions
one case shown 1
one family large found
exact biological function large though they strongly associated play regulatory role receptor activity

both structures were obtained using method but was at whereas was at
two proteins yet was obtained their structural alignment
contains region was structure
protein was presence natural
addition experimental studies computational analyses sets experimentally determined structures protein regions provided evidence existence protein observed both disordered states
authors showed they characterized amino different than those either disordered proteins their main functional regulatory
examples discussed above demonstrate strong influence experimental parameters disordered residues proteins
however hypothesis variation experimental conditions could potentially structural changes existence position length disordered regions not been tested
following work provide evidence significant variation disordered regions protein structures general under same different experimental conditions basic environmental regulation protein structure disordered regions
