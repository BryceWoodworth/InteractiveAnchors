take advantage relationship between network theory field data analysis relationship among network gene networks
network theory relationships among genes
data analysis techniques also used address difficult problems network theory
describe conditions when close relationship exists between network analysis data analysis techniques provide between two
using provide network derive relationships among them
use value expression data gene networks matrices factor into specific
high low level networks allow us study relationships among among genes
networks where genes significant respect sample show network concept connectivity measure
our results using human yeast gene expression data
network methods data methods application development systems methods
introduction
many biological networks properties
common global properties include presence highly nodes approximate scale free
common local properties include presence patterns regulation networks
one goal article describe existing novel network used describe local global network properties
example clustering network concept measures
particularly network defined gene measure
gene measures practical importance since they allow one gene information into network analysis
functional analysis gene measure could pathway
gene experiments gene could
study gene measures since sample statistical measure gene
example expression leads gene measure
many data analysis methods focus relationship between sample gene expression data
example gene methods aim find genes significantly associated sample another example prediction methods aim predict sample basis gene expression data
gene expression across samples highly correlated natural describe their using network
genes similar expression patterns may form pathways regulatory signaling
gene networks been used describe many organisms yeast humans
gene network methods also been used data analysis tasks gene outcome prediction
while utility network methods data been demonstrated utility data analysis techniques network problems not yet been
one goal article show simple used derive network results if networks defined basis correlation matrix
although many our network will useful general networks particularly gene networks
gene networks basis gene measure
network nodes genes more gene expression
gene expression i vector whose components report gene expression values across
define similarity s between genes i value correlation between their expression
using procedure similarity into measure
network between gene expression i defined similarity s threshold parameter
thus two genes if correlation between their expression threshold
correlation leads simple network but may lead loss if been set there will no between two genes if their correlation
continuous nature information one could simply define matrix value gene expression correlation matrix s
however since data number samples often small others found useful strong
natural define between two genes power value correlation 1
approach leads gene network
present empirical results networks main
