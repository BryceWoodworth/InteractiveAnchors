introduction
species through two structure when they
common adaptation wide range conditions at including
key model organisms biology include species particular
latter species target genome sequencing whose results expected
species group provides model both fundamental questions adaptation response well applications
its use into particular potential applications
moreover its relatively complex structure higher combined fact potential model human disease
context important understand mechanisms environmental given their behavioral options highly due phase their
past between higher organisms been versus studies between large humans versus large tree body
less attention been particular molecular mechanisms through they achieve
one represented response key factor adaptation been studied context certain extent specifically genes
regulation either transcription factors complex structure
analysis datasets demonstrated transcription factors proteins not distributed but highly relative gene increases scale
been later extended studies their rates
thus now known one way organisms achieve degree regulation gene strategy
yet whether similar since genome sequences those so far range comparative studies performed
far recent studies focused response particular revealed process involves up known four protein
despite unique genes including systems not involving proteins
other words different gene strategy might both model organisms
thus what mechanisms through response general particular strategy gene expression
focus family case study response examine structure function region
previously two distinct genes same genomic been called genes
detailed sequence analysis revealed two genes contain exhibit both regions but differ their regions well three due presence sequences
region both genes contains multiple binding sites various transcription factors highly potential interactions factors patterns gene regulation
comparative analysis gene across all available sequence data shown genomes contain relatively small number genes compared those
thus genome might contain relatively small number genes question how expression other genes
present work perform detailed analysis region terms structure expression presence previously sequence elements unknown function
based expression data also potential associations another genes involved complex pattern expression across
two discussed within context existing knowledge expected towards understanding response organisms
