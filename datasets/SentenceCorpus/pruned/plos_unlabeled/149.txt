evidence t cells t target cells play role
first step t cell being research trials network at us health

second step design will
step trials measure
disease first through stable phase then
typically measured after primary
even without could individual need transmission
second primary analysis step among subjects groups
nature trials design presented statistical
because subjects comparison determined event analysis selection bias
specifically analysis differences would not effect but rather mixture effects variables correlated
latter may distributed between groups
example selection bias would occur if only relatively strong system group would than group
even if no effect group would expected higher than those group
account selection bias would lead inference increases
analysis step trials other developed statistical techniques effect allow levels selection bias
however did not consider underlying biological mechanisms could account effects
rather they arbitrary effects studied statistical characteristics
evaluate statistical methods more relevant manner consider here various effects
at their present development mathematical models system made few predictions because uncertainty about most important mechanisms values
models they primary after between response formation state other aspects
addition recent estimate rate at cells
new stochastic models primary response made does not appear might
using step trials explicitly
let us
will mean either no target cells at all does not some small number
number at any time disease
outcome might described depending
consistent common after primary
because t cells require step before they clear cells most defined
against not may large used experiments
more relevant observation t cell memory but
one finding cellular was but was either due
small t cells due activation events system memory
however could not prove actually
but other particular
however may t cells here impact statistical estimation some biological mechanism into our simulations
combined stochastic models so impact t cells both probability given subjects
requires more particular about action
because extent uncertainty about mechanisms do not predict outcome trials
rather models provide cases where influence selection bias present when present resulting biological scenarios rather than assumptions
then generate step trials method test
step trials two parameters will difference mean subjects where defined average two rna levels measured at 2 after
data will using method estimates effect while levels selection bias

methods estimate average effect difference mean
fundamental difficulty lack knowledge about subjects group would require data outcome both under under but each subject only one outcomes observed
