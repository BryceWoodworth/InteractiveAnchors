specific dna sequences
because sequences genomic dna identify key elements determine patterns gene expression
detection differences among sequences understanding molecular basis both gene expression evolution
here address problem target protein 2 several species
particularly highly conserved different not only genes but also expression genes differ species species
our approach dna binding site sequences given into motifs using machine learning method strategy
into computational classification were produced resulting discovery new problem functional sites dna analysis
moreover found certain were useful biological properties binding site sequences including gains losses binding sites through evolutionary events well species
high within well regulatory protein them suggests major between related species not due binding sites was previously suggested other
instead may fast evolution target genes resulting interaction those binding sites rna
introduction
whole genome sequences well data provide understanding underlying regulatory systems
still however sequence elements relevant gene expression those corresponding binding sites factors rna when they genomic dna sequences do not play role gene expression
how does single sequences when major expression
also how does given there targets
methods matching pattern been used identify particular
tools discovery designed find unknown relatively short sequence patterns regions genomes
because performed context short signals high statistical noise current tools tend relevant number samples only
moreover used methods while increasing lower sensitivity but still functional
because single pattern derived dna sequences often might define distinct regulatory mechanisms
overall use sequence motifs among even across species discovery key features within across species
methods motifs into classical strategy
then compared different motifs into motifs computational clustering perspective
so amount useful genomic information through effective biological experimental data then combined them into accurate predictor
although there computational was not clear if motifs were just computational if they could provide into regulatory process out its targets
address problem ability gene expression both within across genomes
first used between functional using combination expression experiments
then determined evolutionary their rate evolution gain loss events along tree
variation genes regulatory protein well us evaluate major between species
applied our approach analyze genes system adaptation low 2 environments several species including species species species species species
systems represent primary signal organisms
although proteins systems often well conserved different species like control expression many genes one major sources genomic variation
