report state functional connectivity graph analysis detection techniques analyze four networks defined studies
previously reported find across development between regions close space integration between selected regions space
generalization across multiple networks suggests general principle changes functional connectivity would graph analyses brain networks

over development multiple functional networks local more distributed
argue local distributed important understanding development neural systems underlying
further graph similar graphs both like properties while detection optimization stable within graphs different between
observations suggest early both relatively efficient systems may solve similar information processing problems ways
introduction
human brain both perform distinct types information processing
into functional networks support various cognitive functions
studies development often identify functional networks

major work nature functional human brain development based results functional studies
differences activation particular brain region between cognitive task
experiments been our current understanding brain development
addition activation studies relatively new method state functional connectivity allows functional relationships between regions across development
state based discovery level dependent signal but regions show strong at
low frequency appear neural activity
effect interactions occur when subject not task
been used several domains examine memory attention task control systems
addition because does not require active behavioral task experimental design subject training
thus used changes network structure disease across development
previous work control applied set regions derived studies tasks
analysis revealed brain regions different control signals across many tasks into distinct functional networks
based functional activation regions characterized previous study network control
contrast network stable task
along two task control networks set regions activity across tasks network
network both networks
functional may represent pathways involved task level control provide feedback information both control networks
another functional network one most sets regions examined network
network was first characterized consistent activity during tasks compared
analyses shown regions along associated temporal regions correlated at
while distinct function network often activity notion
