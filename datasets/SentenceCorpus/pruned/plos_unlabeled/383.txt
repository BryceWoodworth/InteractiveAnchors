recently about drug discovery systems biology perspective
between biological responses rather than one one may provide better understanding disease development achieve accurate evaluation drug
new approach been applied drug design
example focused biochemical network
good understanding disease regulatory network level used model predictions develop factor trials
et al recently practical applications systems biology drug discovery
researchers development drug design strategies level disease system using computational models experiments
paper study dynamic properties metabolic network human more into drug design
model metabolic network was developed
analysis simulation addition were performed study network
effects were difference between functional mixture two types was studied
corresponding experiments introduction were performed were found consistent model predictions
our work shows important
compared against multiple targets control network lead treatment
