introduction
g signaling variety dynamic behaviors despite their use single relatively simple biochemical mechanism
signal proteins
may through
bound over both activation cells variable effect
activation rates upon addition thus range
g proteins signals cycle binding bound state g active bound
rates activation effects signal output at state interactions g g proteins multiple other proteins
effect depends individual proteins their their own regulatory
regulatory g protein been difficult quantitative understanding how they control signal output
while some signals particularly g cells real time been reactions cycle protein protein binding
recently developed but still do not provide complete multiple events often do not provide data
quantitative biochemical using systems provided biochemical data but not described regulatory interactions so important
quantitative understanding dynamic behavior g protein remains
computational modeling used about complex biochemical systems including g protein signaling
quantitative models potentially information individual reactions behavior complex system use data test validity proposed mechanism
work example provided consistent examples approaches g protein signaling
g yeast response also been focus significant modeling because its
at least one case simple model pathway discovery novel mechanism feedback regulation model
however modeling g protein often been parameters chosen few reactions model output experimental result
g protein itself been into arbitrary function concentration receptor regulation allow analysis event 2 protein even more transcription
major problem quantitative models g protein been accurate parameters many processes known occur
include both cycle reactions multiple interactions reactions
problem significant because local protein at membrane proteins both unknown either cells during dynamic signaling
study used proteins g c 1 at into first
estimated formation according their individual
second major problem modeling signaling through g protein difficulty correct even values rate reactions model
despite their small size model single g protein will contain multiple parameters not individual measurements
parameters may widely among different most approaches
if all most relevant parameters not available interest then large must produced allow parameters data
even numerical process values parameters both central problems modeling signaling systems
extended several approaches difficulty model large number parameters using amount data
present complex model signal output g protein model contains many regulatory interactions g protein signaling
used data support strategy argue most parameters statistical data help individual parameters
parameter set shows receptor both binding activity
further model strongly activity binding receptor g protein cycle thus further activity
protein binding direct interaction was suggested mechanism how upon without signaling
simulation signal output how mechanisms control signal
