determine characteristics at applied range solutions
tested variety structures molecular dynamics simulations based experimentally proposed structure
values were range
better experimental range was obtained using structures simulation where values range
observed no significant variation applied any structures tested observed experimentally result formation rather than feature open structure
found highly current order
consistent highly nature but experimental finding only
tested sensitivity our model several parameters found significant influence characteristics
best experimental data was obtained using each set percent literature value used several other studies
overall work useful between previous work focused structure experimental at their characteristics
introduction
small proteins produced system many first against

thus far drug design been lack understanding fundamental mechanism action

various structural classes been shown significant effects both model membrane systems

prior studies structure early evidence was provided experiments characteristics were measured
knowledge through may related their mechanism action since through membrane could result potentially membrane
experiments several
they found form presence several different solutions almost no
furthermore they found does not exhibit any over range
out measurements across several different types well
authors found both form
they reported range depending used applied

particular explore between structural features size well experimental finding both only despite having total
our based theory method fixed structure presence applied
our model across measure resulting current
since model requires structure perform using several simulations
