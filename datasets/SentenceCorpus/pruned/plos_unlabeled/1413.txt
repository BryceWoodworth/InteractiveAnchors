idea been study protein protein interaction networks
low their high
was proposed local whereas global
here show reported importance network connectivity fact subset them
few central do not particularly low expression correlation idea between function
was distribution show feature not always robust changes
properties do not general
however find significant between interaction functional similarity proteins
suggest terms protein interaction networks not might more useful interactions rather than individual proteins
introduction
protein interaction networks data obtained via techniques yeast do not fact actual interactions occur depend physiological conditions
instance expressed proteins also change over time
thus specific active well their form might depend where when one network
one way information use expression data experiments
et al examined extent yeast their interaction
they defined proteins degree at least where degree number
based correlation expression over all they into two distinct those low those high
they two types play different thought single functions performed group proteins all expressed at same time whereas described between groups perform functions active at different times under different conditions
validity since been sequence there no issue
two points distribution was observed general property data set
different statistical tests suggested different
however despite hypothesis been highly literature
here following up work et al initial data suggest additional problems statistical was
their results find observed suggest were more essential global connectivity was due very small number key rather than being property set
more generally use perspective et al define structural context protein interaction networks
our results there little correlation between expression structural
more family was based taking into account differences expression addition also
recent study et al existence along same human
show their observation binary classification changes algorithm used expression data kernel function used distribution
data does not fact any significant per test been observed et al yeast data
question because was key part original paper particular because made et al human data
however possible like may exist even distribution why also examine more general question whether network proteins related their properties interaction
many networks some they into groups nodes relatively high
known often distinct functional
several studies recent years considered existence structure interaction networks
algorithms been developed networks
example concept graph used extent number within groups number would expected appropriate random network
one standard techniques network into graph
use idea structure take new approach problem classification basis network rather than basis expression data
our biological nature should thus network
network into set possible statistics measure connectivity each both within its own other
one method relevant nodes metabolic network was procedure our protein interaction networks
then examine extent up hypothesis finding little evidence support
one might also about extent observed properties dependent particular network being
several discussed at length about existing protein interaction data sets
data been using multiple methods most
recent paper et al examined properties interaction networks were derived different sources experimental bias might play key role properties observed given data set
particular their findings suggest key interactions between protein so data sets may contain high whereas interactions within so networks highly their
possible distribution interaction data sets used information was combined both sources
here compare several yeast interaction data sets find both widely structural properties low level
finally alternative suggest about networks measures rather than nodes
other words one interactions between proteins rather than proteins themselves
use measure known examine its relation protein functional
here well find little evidence significant correlation expression
however there seems strong relation between functional similarity proteins so role might some utility
examined proposed protein interaction network into several different prior appear various changes data methods used
observed differences network two types only small number particularly important
results existing evidence against existence
furthermore detailed analysis network novel perspective structure within context suggests more than simple
proteins show variety characteristics appear along there does not exist clear correlation between their expression their interaction
other hand relation functional proteins framework more notion both nodes might provide better framework understanding
