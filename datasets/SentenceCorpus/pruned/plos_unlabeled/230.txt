detailed computational model study two vegf under conditions
using parameters based experimental measurements model vegf binding binding activation cell vegf
predicted vegf distributions receptor binding
significant vegf were predicted vegf due distribution
relative vegf were not matrix overall vegf expression level but were dependent vegf receptor density rate parameters
vegf subset increased vegf possible
number relative position determined vegf distribution vegf receptor activation
total vegf expression level into small number increase number
vegf concentration predicted sufficient cellular cell long
vegf also result activation vegf
first model vegf provides design evaluation approaches
introduction
growth factor key increases cells
there main vegf most
vegf expressed at different levels variety cells body including
vegf domain allows binding
vegf also but domain
because domain only vegf present high matrix membrane two different signaling both physiological cancer
furthermore due presence high cells large amount vegf bound sources vegf vegf
cellular response vegf occurs when signaling binding vegf its cell receptor
vegf after two vegf
their interactions vegf each other discussed
vegf involved both physiological
vegf necessary physiological under conditions via mechanisms pathway increased
during both increased through vegf
because importance vegf many trials under way both
including vegf rna human vegf
use vegf treatment generated interest but direct vegf not yet produced effective results humans initial trials cells effective but require further work
effective better understanding needed both physiological
increasing vegf concentration leads but vegf critical levels may result formation
thus normal only if vegf above threshold levels but below threshold levels over time
furthermore responses vegf depend not only vegf concentration but also vegf direct growth
therefore not sufficient measure vegf large samples order predict behavior
present study computational model study vegf effects vegf receptor binding using sample environment
previously models vegf binding cells effect presence growth factor
also shown using methods despite very small free vegf description terms vegf
vegf also been studied using computational model
however our knowledge first model vegf complex environment two most vegf through binding vegf vegf receptor binding
was not model because there no available measurements amount
using model predict vegf distribution analyze vegf at measure experimentally
use model will understanding mechanisms physiological vegf
model general may upon future include additional molecular species new experimental data expression level also applied specific drug interactions other types
