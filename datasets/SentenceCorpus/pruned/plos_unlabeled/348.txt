indeed recent clusters human at transmission humans who were their
observation mutations recent more efficient transmission including humans
likely potential will present itself through increase number humans who been close contact case
therefore detection control clusters key importance
clusters may result multiple multiple transmission events humans who were multiple transmission events humans who were themselves humans
evidence most ability humans
often thought made new species usually not transmission new new species will increase over time process adaptation means natural selection
however case humans evidence so far does not prediction
mechanisms could lack efficient secondary transmission could due effect humans higher than humans humans changes after limit after been
paper develop method different transmission setting
our main aim investigate whether transmission been transmission primary individual whether there evidence transmission extended first
our analyses based theoretical distribution size finite populations allow methods transmission
apply method recent study transmission highly large
after detection control strategy affected regions
all total during more than were
studies revealed at least humans had taken place
addition more than who had not been direct contact were reported positive
transmission did occur individuals
here data transmission transmission events extent transmission humans who were humans
statistical analyses power analyses obtain into study size needed able find significant secondary transmission given present
although applied method specific our method general interest estimation transmission rates based data most
instance our method analysis not analysis but just well used estimate different transmission rates human potential control measures
