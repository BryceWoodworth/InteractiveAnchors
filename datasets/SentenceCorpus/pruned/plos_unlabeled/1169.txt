event models often through transcription factors
here use model elements regulation order understand how both stochastic events cell decisions
our results suggest positive receptor feedback response stimuli during robustness both states while
our model provides support both stochastic theories cell transcription factors but signaling strongly bias decisions complex behaviors robust
simulations further suggest cell state depend state well chosen
our model shows good receptor expression experiments provides computational framework both classical alternative been observed experimentally
introduction

exact molecular events direct at cell at level but well transcription factors play critical
transcription factors been identified

stochastic theory expression transcription factors due intrinsic noise cells decision whereas theory receptor signals during shows decisions growth factor cues
underlying question both theories whether provide cues signals
model does not account certain cell types even when their out
distribution population into cells suggested stochastic model explain how specific cell types during how after
recent study techniques at level suggests there validity both theories
authors showed strongly choice although was still possible
more understanding may biochemical associations events
gene expression pattern during observed not only transcription factors but also
critical signal during transcription factor however need receptor event also still
particularly since low number present cell sufficient cues
during expression receptor expression transcription factor often due presence transcription factor binding domains region receptor gene
advantage receptor expression through transcription factor not
recent biochemical evidence also suggests provide signals transcription factors through also expression transcription factors during cell
cell event rather than transition cell stable cell
mathematical modeling analysis been used provide into biological networks give behaviors
typically networks involved cellular memory through behaviors response
components generate system between two stable states include feedback noise
previous models suggested via cell intrinsic events but models assumed existence positive feedback achieve do not consider role cues
while widely biological mechanism may play important role alternative mechanisms generate similar behavior networks where not been observed
example previously shown positive feedback receptor generate robust stimulus without model
furthermore even networks feedback may provide additional robustness system behavior more regulation
here present model regulation between transcription factors previously understand between factors decisions
our model shows critical
network memory respect stimuli provide robustness both states
model suggests noise network stochastic between stable however distribution population among various states during still strongly cues
furthermore modeling framework both classical alternative seen
although cell likely represent our model may provide initial step towards understanding how factors intrinsic factors may new mechanisms decisions
