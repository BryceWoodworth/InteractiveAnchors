certain theories suggest should difficult disease under individual at high levels
there been examples consistent theory
other hand was despite many
previous modeling studies between disease dynamics individual behavior assumed population
comparison here transmission through random contact network
individuals choose whether based based
when size small rational behavior results through
size increases threshold through through whole population resulting large number
outcome convergence between optimal outcomes whereas latter their observed most models individual behavior assume
similar effects observed extended model using natural history assumptions
work significant differences between behavior dynamics populations versus continuous populations
work also shows how disease populations where primary control mechanism may depend whether disease only few close social larger subset population
introduction
analyses often should difficult disease under policy without other
increases disease due
risk individuals while individual risk due remains constant
hence individual also reduced increases
should true principle even disease very high case rates long risk small
effect similar also been game theoretical analyses disease dynamics
game theoretical been shown threshold not if risk because small group individuals achieve higher payoff strategy
behavior been suggested possible policy more recently
recent work rule instance finding cases multiple when when
only disease been although than before
was particularly
often had widely
instance was some states but others
even when were less individuals often without individual financial
if theories correct cannot generally under how was despite some
most if not all previous mathematical models analyze between optimal strategies under considered populations without spatial social contact structure where populations large approximation apply
also true models more generally including those study dynamics at level problem
previous analyses populations generally considered individuals likely their own they general
however models certain situations been widely differences between predictions models models where transmission take place contact network
present context assumption good approximation highly through
however assumption seems less through close contact
despite few widely reported cases transmission also through close contact typically requires contact
here show disease dynamics under policy introduction social contact structure
analyze social contact network model where each individual each close contact through may
individuals whether not based upon their expected payoffs versus not
assume free individuals situation many major well situation under who program
first study contact network general disease history
at parameter values small using only
size increases while risk constant threshold size
above threshold population both size large number
hence limit large size model dynamics similar those models
because constant size increases how disease transmission network
smaller close contact larger do not require close contact transmission
out similar disease history properties similar results
analysis importance populations modeling behavior close contact provides framework previous theoretical predictions under empirical fact global local many other through
