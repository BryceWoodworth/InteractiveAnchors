shown existing processing motion perception difference over time well motion do not general solution problem local motion
instead suggest local constraints combination other cues provide more framework solution problem
context problem derive predictions two vector normal motion whereas average based motion
predicting perceived motion motion provides between strategies motion processing

seems motion input visual processing
introduction
representation world input fundamental problem visual system solve
true well dynamic events space
latter problem inference dynamic events world motion signals into
following only consider observed motion
space described motion direction
motion direction measured terms motion direction together expressed motion vector system
vector highly visual system because representation local estimates vector field provides basis perception object motion direction objects
information essential events well actions dynamic environment
if single point other unique feature input then together point provides unique solution problem
if however stimulus spatial extent then local motion direction corresponding remains additional constraints needed solve problem
problem problems computational especially context structure motion
methods most widely used techniques image sequences
they into local into more global methods
both techniques constraints image estimate system
important note only provides direction image normal component
some form regularization needed
similar techniques terms error regularization been detection
algorithms processing
computational studies motion algorithms usually fast efficient when tested against
here less robustness particular
instead understand predict behavioral characteristics human motion perception
motion perception been context problem but there lack studies problem motion perception
any solution motion problem rely sampling local information
there at least three known cell types early visual may involved local simple complex motion cells cells over time motion cells
therefore not three approaches motion perception difference over time motion
three approaches generated body research but results been nature motion processing remains issue
despite empirical studies motion there lack studies true motion stimuli
previous studies typically stimulus motion direction
problem local motion however features so motion perception been study motion perception
large bias been found stimuli motion direction processing strategies different three main processing models
seems investigate local motion stimuli motion direction because they local may motion processing
aim paper evaluate existing models motion perception gain better understanding motion perception
first show existing models motion perception solve problem motion
second constraints demonstrate additional information necessary local constraints derive estimate
third compare two strategies perceived motion when local motion direction
shown critical stimulus conditions exist help determine whether motion perception motion motion
