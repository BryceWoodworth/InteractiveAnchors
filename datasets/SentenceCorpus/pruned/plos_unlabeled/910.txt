drug effects intrinsic properties drug specific signaling network
here describe approach identify drug effects
our proposed method drug effects investigated under signaling network
pathway made specific key signals under experimental conditions
performed via linear program solution standard procedure previous
then same key signals under presence drug specific
prove our case make evaluate effects growth factor receptor drug
effects main target but also effects due either drug specific
finding signaling effect cannot binding approaches
our method approach identify drug effects small size pathways larger any type signaling
method drug effects pathways mechanisms
introduction
drug discovery focus
primary objective target protein within cells order cell
other pathways within cells well similar other cell types should approach
however despite new potential targets sequencing human genome rather few effective
major understand mechanisms drug actions either due complex signaling networks cells due drug
finding targets based using protein
main goal biochemical activity them
most cases target known effect signaling pathway activity protein
however little know how signaling network affected
addition drug effects several most kinase there between binding there additional between binding activity signals
address drug effects more physiological conditions novel genomic tools recently been developed
genomic analysis computational approaches drug target been developed
despite genomic approaches discovery step function cell
towards goal strategy target identification
approach support cellular binding proteins identified
however experiments usually require large protein more proteins result several due interactions
order interaction problem another strategy uses quantitative
while approach significantly interaction problem also space those
more recently quantitative using search space all targets do not drug
however requires population thus application primary cells limited
taken together all techniques above best case all targets drug but no information provided whether binding transmission signal protein how those affect signaling network cell
here describe significantly different approach identify drug effects where they signaling pathways
instead binding pathway following key events under several
presented 1
experimental using measure key events under more than different conditions generated treatment stimuli
based signaling response set possible reactions specific pathway using efficient optimization known linear
approach upon optimization approach proposed
using standard global
evaluate drug effects subject cells same stimuli presence same key events
then without assumption drug target changes pathway without drug presence
demonstrate our approach construct data cell
then identify effects four two kinase kinase
when our method applied those find their main target effect also several unknown but active effects
case find pathway
contrast previously developed techniques our method based actual effect events into signaling network
applied any type kinase etc computational our approach more efficient than current algorithms pathway optimization identify main drug effects well unknown effects pathways between measured proteins
our fast drug actions into potential mechanisms
