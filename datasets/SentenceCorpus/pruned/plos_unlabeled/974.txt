two methods were where measures response applied latter individual network
was demonstrated increases more addition form than those form
networks density increases power g function frequency motion at low frequency
under increasing network more three behavior observed each different at tested
case only small via highly support
thus introduce concept framework subset full network high
effects due appear important only at relatively low when average distance greater than length
taken together our results suggest network different mechanisms depending amount
introduction
most protein cells important role wide range biological
form into various proteins
been known role cells therefore appropriate functions cells control their properties
thus properties networks cells well understanding wide variety cellular processes
experiments been properties cells using variety techniques
experiments been observed among measurements using many observed features not well
example measured much smaller than those determined
also although distinct power responses often been observed their not yet
characteristics networks been studied
two computational models networks large revealed two
recently using approach many properties networks observed experiments
behavior networks was also investigated using dynamics concept where behavior was observed
however most models explicitly take into account account they been used explore effects finite all potentially important factors matrix
objective previous new into underlying mechanisms develop dynamics model network features interaction among more
response applied individual investigate properties networks
paper term network used network being
should however some properties our model especially were estimated since they not experimentally
due model parameter uncertainty results should therefore network but lack networks
found features experimentally observed behaviors networks
loss g g power functions frequency
increased network
important role depending degree
found response network framework while other little
physiological conditions where distance between points along much than length found little role so network system
our computational model how various responses properties network under different conditions
