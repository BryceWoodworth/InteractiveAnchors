although research environments studies humans shown
investigated how humans perform reward decision task temporal constraints each choice time later trials at each
demonstrated most our subjects experiment
further rate used our subjects total reward gain our task
our results suggest particular temporal determined task subject question notion reward universal principle
introduction
limited amount time available before need make large number choices our total reward gain
particular when between larger but reward smaller but more reward compare values associated each reward choose reward associated larger value
critical choices reward values function rewards function
two main classes models reward been
although researchers environments all behavioral studies directly compared two types humans better reward choice data than does
reward value given reward d delay rate
given factor note here large rate small factor
because constant rate rational predicts constant preference
human studies subjects asked make number choices between small rewards larger rewards years future after about each alternative
studies reward value given formula
studies make reward choices experience both rewards
constant if makes choice same reward after same delay d average reward rate function delay t all times delay each reward value
because rate function delay been predicts preference choice
instance individual may one two but at same time two one
often presented between future between see
what situations make reward choices based
total gain situations constant probability reward loss per time exact estimate time future reward see
because value given reward rate total gain situations constant at each
but does total gain situations situations choices rewards constant limited total time
situations model reward rate
but trials not independent each other may not average reward rate thus total gain
instance relatively long both rewards although may large reward small more reward may result smaller overall average reward rate
small but reward subject next more trials
thus situations strategy values rewards less than does would total gain
how far future rewards should considered
large rate biases individuals small more rewards
individuals well individuals functions than
small rate large more rewards
yet individuals must obtain some rewards instance must find before before before
thus rate should total gain task situations choices rewards limited total time
here designed task study whether humans could function whose total gain
at each subjects had choose between smaller more reward larger reward rewards fixed
subjects reward other objective measures reward did not provide direct delay
instead subjects had at each between one two made small
stimulus reward amount
at each initial number stimulus small delay d s initial number stimulus large delay d subject was then choose one two stimulus had been selected previous step showed more other stimulus was previous step
stimuli were always one time step
events was either was
then reward was shown during s
experiment total time was limited s each s give subject some time
thus each subject had available total reward
because subjects performed minimum one training before experiment they were highly task
subjects were total reward at end experiment
