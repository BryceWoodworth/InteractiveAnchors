drug world including human health need develop new effective agents
previously developed systems biology approach identify major scale
paper further demonstrate value approach through discovery existing available treatment disease potential
predicted directly binding
prediction using whose active component
concentration well below concentration determined model using human cell
moreover activity percent at concentration thus active component lead new class
more generally described paper drug discovery effort novel drug leads therefore development new
introduction
leading among
been estimated world health almost population 2 people disease
every more than people develop active form disease 2
over per more than percent
who estimated if was then disease would more
despite current global situation over four
use agents time needed
defined
effective treatment use drug drug well key
difficult because only drug classes exhibit very low high
world including human health therefore need identify new agents
developed either strategies through available target protein same similar structures functions
drug discovery involves use high techniques identify new both natural novel
approach very few field drug discovery
indeed biochemical robust lead process
identification both molecular targets essential active cells task
even more however appropriate levels order achieve small disease models
high involved new
fact been estimated single new drug more than us
two alternative drug discovery strategies some associated drug discovery strategies both widely discovery novel
approach involves existing treatment another disease
some most important use were derived process
major significant cost time
when molecular target present under other possible strategy identified points
examples approach include lead series treatment use cancer
one main drug discovery develop effective agents through optimization binding specific protein target
way effects resulting
however recent genome sequencing revealed proteins involved different biochemical pathways even different may functional binding similar properties
therefore one target could considered basis leads different target
recent work large scale interactions et al revealed extent leads across
they percent active their database had observed activity more than one target
were found active against targets within same gene family significant number had activity across different gene
finding so many more than one target provided optimization approach recently developed
approach involves use new targets concept finite number small molecules humans
process itself involves limited number drug molecules then so they show new target original target
way possible derive whole new active molecules single drug
since drug molecules known humans overall time cost drug discovery significantly reduced when compared strategies
developed novel computational strategy identify major scale
our concept across gene more likely goal new ones
our systems biology approach
binding site available drug predicted structure model target protein
similar binding sites identified across using efficient accurate functional site search algorithm
interactions between drug using
only those do not experience drug selected further analysis
drug further its properties taking into account both primary target across genome
our approach complex interaction networks scale
lead all drug targets across different gene
moreover lead optimization focus known outcomes
way our approach potential increase rate drug discovery development involved
present study demonstrate our systems biology approach through discovery potential
identified
target human involved
they used disease increasing primary drug
predicted protein essential type cell
target
similar developed direct require no activation
thus they may observed mechanism many
our computational predictions been drug growth at concentration well below concentration leading cellular
direct further experimental shown reduce activity up percent at effective concentration since few effects shows potential drug lead development new class properties
