when system often how work across number
here show humans solve problem both output effort involved
previous studies investigated temporal two despite having very different theoretical could not because noise system increases effort leads very similar predictions
when multiple different noise effort characteristics combined however two cost terms
here measure importance effort how humans between two
identified variation little
effort used maximum each
terms were then used predict optimal distribution task participants had produce target total n two using different
comparing predicted distribution across actual distribution chosen participants were able estimate relative importance effort 1 effort being most important
our results system uses both produced output effort although effort
introduction
system highly same task always many different sequences
part fact there often multiple produce same effect
thus case brain choose how given task across set
despite number system particular solutions
example when action different
explain why brain way propose cost function biological system over learning
form cost function system had sufficient task dynamics find optimal solution make predictions about how biological should produced under given task
number different cost functions biological been proposed
most studies here there may only one effect but there still many different ways over
example all possible system
different components cost functions generally into two effort
effort usually take form
both proposed system sequence at
under assumption noise noise increases model predict important characteristics control both
while effort different theoretical learning mechanism involved optimization they make very similar predictions temporal optimal
indeed shown reduce under signal dependent noise leads term cost function over term associated effort
thus temporal effort
however effort lead different predictions distribution work across because noise effort characteristics different independent
here study how humans work across different when they produce given target
independent noise characteristics influence effort
