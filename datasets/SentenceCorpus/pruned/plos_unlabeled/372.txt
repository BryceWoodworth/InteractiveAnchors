first developed reaction model response signals at signal changes signal
previous cell models proposed show similar behaviors our model despite difference molecular networks
us compare models found models components
based common properties developed models conserved reaction system
models similar behaviors cell model
using models found multiple resulting single stable sensitivity changes signal specifically at
although molecular networks may differ one cell type another behaviors cell cells similar there should fundamental principle
thus propose conserved reaction system one cell
introduction
cells cells temporal spatial signals
process known fundamental cellular process
cell specific molecular events take place at
molecular cells known cell
usually one important property because cell two could not
another behavior higher sensitivity signals
would also important because direction should at
many molecules involved cells been identified
some molecules including specifically at whereas others including at cells
family small particular play central role cell
however mechanism spatial cell yet
many mathematical models account signal cell been proposed
local global model been proposed explain spatial
some models involve positive feedback signaling molecules
reaction model local effects been proposed sensitivity
most reported models cell involve detailed parameters rate been many parameters
although detailed models at least experimental observations cell theoretical underlying cell not been explicitly thus simple model used study needed common cell
although reported models distinct molecular species networks should especially many them able exhibit similar behaviors cell their different
fact common principle should models model common cell
because small key cell first developed reaction model basis model examine spatial properties
found interaction per generate specific spatial our model shows important behaviors cell
also found our model behaviors similar model based molecular networks different
suggests common should both models
found components conserved models our model
based common properties models conserved reaction system found properties account critical behaviors cell
results strongly suggest components one fundamental cell
