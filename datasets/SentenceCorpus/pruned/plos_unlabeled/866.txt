evolution described terms simple interactions attention recent years where several key results were obtained
among those now well social interaction networks when terms games
up now however social interactions into not been other aspects investigated
here out study example game participants may
show nature social network game made may become social context individual
new numerical analysis networks no instead individuals general game
find population structure evolutionary dynamics when each same cost among games
work provides clear evidence while individual rational may actions nature social interactions may local into global problem
introduction
no like any other many popular
one them states i situations individuals decision common expression above no
amount given
out often situations more important than amount given
let us event some
typically their given they shown large amount money
at many same indeed mechanism common effective
but what amount
many despite being most likely small both also what overall amount
but does large number participants who given fact their role model
other words but not amount given
also examples decisions often fact some people
those who there also those who simply because they who
many other examples real life could provided along similar up
theoretical perspective many situations provide examples games often social moral
nature complexity interactions among social
involves two
both cost c common
one who
total amount factor between two participants
hence i using strategy s i payoff formula game leading following payoff
formula
2 no strategy well populations yet formula better play c despite fact pair d higher payoff than c formula game example many central results been obtained over years particular context evolutionary game theory been explicitly shown population structure despite its importance being form group selection
makes difference whether likely population not
evolutionary game theory finite populations may very populations even any population structure stable strategies population size dependent
population structures play important role evolution under other social result number
mathematical condition was obtained become populations along networks making use methods limited subset game payoff matrices
result limit selection also important feature evolutionary game theoretical outcome depends evolutionary dynamics how individual strategy
furthermore evolutionary game dynamics populations along multiple networks been well mechanisms under adaptive population structures been identified both games
results amount research work
common all studies settings underlying social view every c fixed cost c per game same b
however if what not amount given then there no assume same cost c each game
depending amount each individual overall result evolutionary dynamics may change
two person game introduced above provides not only introduce but also between game dynamics social first individual cost c 1 if c
hence i now following payoff different different individuals
natural who will evolutionary under conditions
often amount each individual correlated social context actually
complex social networks some individuals play different more more often than others
empirical studies demonstrated social networks both properties distribution
where different individuals may very different social environments indeed every c will always provide same amount every game interaction hence problem standard studied so far
context games social networks been found
however similar relation between interactions physical games intrinsic complexity cannot words theory many person games may games relation
here every c same cost c each game also explore limit every c same overall amount c however amount between all games defined social network
instance c may amount each individual all
hence each game will depend now social context each c will interactions two individuals may different same game
sense will identified no amount given
