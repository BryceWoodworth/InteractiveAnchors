extent changes behaviors affect remains key issue control
study effect changes risk different settings
where percent cases were was used example
stochastic model was population was into people general population
events were taken into account model
temporal effective contact rates were functions
data techniques markov methods were applied estimate parameters
particular estimates numbers were provided each
average was estimated
model was able impact two transmission rates
effective contact rates were estimated basis time
observation suggests health measures possible changes individual behaviors reduced transmission especially
temporal patterns numbers were similar general population average did not more people than any other person
provide general method estimate time parameters models impact control measures behavioral changes different settings
introduction
been defined population previously but increasing range
several features may make them particularly
first disease difficult when first cases appear especially when
second no specific treatment may known
moreover disease transmission may groups impact
above were similar was long local transmission occur no treatment was much percent cases were
also demonstrated possible existence events during few individuals high number secondary cases
had two first about cases second over cases
despite its particularly features was under control
context changes behavior will occur measures usually control
resulting effects two disease transmission not
effective contact rate combined social probability through each contact essential disease
our aim was estimate temporal variation parameter over
previously mathematical models parameter estimation temporal social
here present approach both together
then method applied
