introduction
metabolic rate b scales body across species b constant typically measured very close
empirical expressed 1 known
many other biological rates times scale simple
example cellular metabolic rates rates growth rates scale whereas time development time scale close
also observed evolution
at levels biological suggests all rates
metabolic rate seems most fundamental because rate at energy taken up environment biochemical reactions growth
series model account metabolic rate body across species
theory biological developed attributes distribution networks
there some evidence at molecular cellular levels wide variety
model since its original even about quality analysis data
one most model cannot predict metabolic rate even though potential was themselves
if were true could not principle explain data whose been reported above below been observed small
model would account metabolic rate body
important note actual nature metabolic rate however not without its own see metabolic rate scales when body taken into
much work at model itself
account different among groups differences constant b 1 assumptions network
while results remains whether not predict significantly different power even any variation b networks following required theory
although been tested applied no theoretical work been provides more detailed predictions original theory
also work at some its assumptions been many network structure might important
what set out do present
show original model only predict
because many predictions tests original model derived
paper derive more predictions tests
our framework approach terms distribution networks model instance framework particular parameters dynamics networks
our main findings 1
only limit organisms size
2
organisms show model does not predict but rather relationship between metabolic rate body
although finite size effects would produce power small size limit importance effects were
show when current practice relationship over range body predicted model differ significantly without any its assumptions framework

when parameter values construct network find resulting at significantly higher than based current data analysis

our data analysis indeed relationship between metabolic rate body however what model
model data analysis
examine original assumptions two ways
first predicted point above network total area at below increases total area at
two into different at points
second allow network differ large small
analyze sensitivity respect each changes context networks finite size
approach similar et al who network other assumptions context
online also argue data analysis should account distribution body thus fact there more small than large ones
despite differences structure systems detailed models each
present paper focus model system
all our assumptions should within context
basic assumptions important context well shown recent studies
analysis many framework exact predictions model not empirical data
means framework remains perspective
latter means model must become more biological may predictions more empirical data
our work how model what effects they
paper follows
assumptions both underlying theory
provide detailed model upon
not original but they not full extent before literature
while section assumptions model novel there seems no single place literature out all components theory
our paper then exact rather than approximate relationship between metabolic rate body then exact predictions networks finite size certain assumptions theory
