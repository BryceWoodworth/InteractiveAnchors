rna molecules will tend through single resulting secondary structure critical function many types rna
secondary structure particular functional rna may depend its sequence
yet some their specific structures during involves larger structural context while other functional may independent
observations question whether particular functional rna may selected secondary structure their context
define property tendency rna sequence same optimal secondary structure whether exists sequence arbitrary
measured degree using method call found exhibit high consistent structural pathway while most other do not
further analysis revealed higher among conserved high may novel new genomic

suggest out selection robustness against during structural function

introduction
our understanding increased over discovery
along increased corresponding attention rna sequence structural measures known novel
secondary structure rna base interactions along length direct effect its function fact been variety rna classes
among examples functional importance rna structure several along associated proteins into large small structural direct protein
rna structure allows its bound amino during
various small small involved rna basis their while structure allows them during process
not limited however some contain structural regulatory motifs sequence occurs regions site
recognition specific rna binding proteins well all involve molecular interactions rna structure
importance structural not limited end sequence structural during various rna also critical
example both some also contain structure out before out
single
example rna its three occurs same rna
case transcription long primary into large structures
complex form complex specific them at base region
range size targets basis their
sequence remains robust structure through sequence when larger primary sequence into when form independent sequence into same
need structural pathway phenomenon through structural motifs
now well novel proteins structural domains most example being proteins
given critical role structural features rna function motifs many might also evolutionary domain domain
process would require novel state structural features its structural features need other sequences
one hand structural context robustness may specific relationship between each sequence its genomic context property been computational
other hand certain may some intrinsic tendency their sequence particular sequence would still robust if were into different context
call property intrinsic structural
structural rna potential larger structure out consistent function through biochemical sequences potentially function when into novel might occur elements
previously while general robustness structural elements rna genomes found there was higher structural robustness conserved elements than elements when short
using similar approach studied intrinsic context set selected reduced environmental found positive relationship between environmental
other work rna proteins suggests there relationship between robustness domain stability well other processes
work analyze over range biological using method different context robustness
show fact do exhibit high degree intrinsic while most other relevant tend not show
other sequence structural features rna find no simple combination features explain
finally show variation among degree correlated genomic well their process produced pathway
propose high intrinsic property particular rna sequences may selected molecules need structural robustness some their function genetic
