introduction
recent studies demonstrated neurons networks functional specific levels neural activity over long time scales
although combination within individual neurons same class widely output neurons even network whole remains stable
some function despite changes
computational models been used explore processes underlying demonstrated many parameters across parameter space similar firing patterns
also seems under global features including distribution conserved across different classes neurons making local features length numbers
computational models not yet how might functional

previous computational studies identified parameters general firing patterns but not how different parameters influence individual models across parameter space
moreover few studies dynamics firing patterns despite role 2 membrane potential synaptic transmission signaling

test like introduce novel application mathematical sensitivity analysis effects different classes parameters like active model output
allows us compare effects each parameters models across parameter space produce similar output mechanisms
sensitivity analysis been used widely biological signaling models understand relationship between model input output but its use within computational been limited
sensitivity analysis performed single optimal model general sensitivity parameter space how each parameter model output
large number parameters their interactions techniques over parameter space models
approaches explore sensitivity provide global parameter while how intrinsic properties individual neurons influence their firing patterns
method compare parameters any computational model
our method defined three basic its sensitivity small models across parameter sensitivity local identify global
our method use reduced model
later demonstrate our sensitivity analysis method applied models include more
our analysis identified over sensitivity even all parameters most
at same time found domains across space different groups parameters even ones had
together results mechanisms both across parameter space
show how used predict between parameters target activity levels area cells
mechanisms exist many systems where function conserved despite structure synaptic input membrane may some changes associated
sensitivity provide new into mechanisms functional brain analysis any biological system
