find variety targets target mechanisms two processing similar mechanisms perception lead search
three no convergence were case targets across sufficient time all possible target model no based cell properties
thus similar neural mechanisms perception actions during search optimal should expected effects natural selection limited time search not across its perception action neural pathways
introduction
studies support existence two distinct neural pathways brain processing visual information
behavior patients brain perception primary visual temporal action primary visual
although there been about whether into brain contains two distinct neural visual world there been no theoretical analysis about functional two different neural
visual search requires their point region potentially regions decisions
what impact having similar versus different neural mechanisms decisions visual search performance visual system
consider two leading computational models human visual search bayesian model search task target one initial
uses knowledge how target statistics spatial accuracy decision at end search
model makes most target optimal if goal was target rather than information decision
depending spatial possible target strategies lead similar
example both models make possible target while make between possible target obtain processing more than one
attention allows both models possible target contain target when making search decisions
target decisions both models based visual information over whole across based evidence presence target
models two processing pathways one where other processing visual information decision about target
rather than having single linear mechanism each pathway model had its own neural mechanism compared visual data at each possible target
likelihood observed responses each mechanisms under hypothesis target present at used make decisions about where decisions
used genetic algorithm method find solutions perception action mechanisms but also effects evolutionary process natural selection neural mechanisms decisions during search
computational complexity bayesian makes difficult model thus used recently proposed approximation
model uncertainty probabilities over potential target
decision rule choose maximum likelihood across potential target each its given
model shown approximate patterns main characteristics patterns our task
process evolution one individuals linear mechanisms perception
each each individual was independent random four simple cells
each individual was two before making search decision about target
performance finding target one was probability individual was its performance accuracy
new was then individuals through process mutation
process was up
