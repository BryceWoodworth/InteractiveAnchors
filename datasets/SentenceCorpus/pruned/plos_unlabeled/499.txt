recently number genetic interactions among gene pairs
studies been at physical protein interactions proteins same molecular complex
here propose method learning protein their functional relationships integration quantitative genetic interactions data
using independent datasets demonstrate method percent more accurate at related protein pairs than previous approaches
application genes involved yeast functional number novel been addition new
find genetic interactions more likely contain essential genes each interactions underlying mechanism
results demonstrate importance both genetic physical interaction data pathway function
introduction
genetic interactions relationships between genes occur when two more genes combination
recently genetic interactions become using genetic analysis
pairs gene interest against every other gene genome
growth measured over all genetic interaction gene no growth genetic interaction
all among group genes
recent made possible measure continuous rates growth
interactions if growth rate gene than expected while interactions true
one popular method analyze genetic interaction data been genes using distance between their genetic interaction
clusters genes similar identify known pathways they contain well any genetic interactions between
approach been applied several genetic interaction yeast including genes involved pathway
et al extended basic clustering concept genes were into same based number interactions other clusters do not same classification
another set methods genetic relationships using physical interactions
among used physical interactions identify both genetic interactions
both cases were clusters proteins each other more often than expected
model predicts clusters directly clusters genetic interactions
model predicts genetic interactions between two physical clusters related
approach was et al using physical
related work et al known information protein sequences identify pairs genetic interactions between them
one above approaches particular they make assumptions about density interactions within between not been
parameters should learned directly data
second relationships identified independent network each genetic interaction
local search strategy lead set highly even one another
finally genetic interactions assumed binary growth events while now made possible measure continuous values genetic interaction
here present new approach quantitative genetic physical interaction data several
interactions set set protein complex cellular function functional relationships between
our approach appropriate pattern physical genetic interactions not but learned examples known
rather than identify each independent all identified within single functional relationships
show method number alternative approaches when applied analyze recent study yeast function new protein protein functional relationships
