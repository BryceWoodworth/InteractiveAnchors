us directly dynamic cellular
although techniques themselves understanding dynamic cellular functions number generated need processing tools statistical information
problem underlying analysis cell lack methods properties
here propose algorithm called evolution relationship between local changes local cell using
algorithm us local their corresponding
thus algorithm between local changes local signals time
energy examined between local area difference activity
expected but correlation time changes
our method dynamics local change local protein activity statistical relationship between them time relationship
thus algorithm value data better understand dynamics cellular function
introduction
cell change key process development organisms
various types change appear during essential events part processes usually different
therefore cell been used key cell state
analyses cell properties been used recently new functions specific proteins
moreover outcomes change us itself role cellular function
quantitative approaches cellular systems they new
because cellular change highly dynamic necessary understand mechanism cell regulation
development direct observation cell changes activity specific proteins but difficulty information number
several approaches context quantitative analysis recently
series studies using quantitative instance revealed power analysis analysis number suggested distinct regulation dynamics different regions
indeed computational methods been used determine properties dynamics protein activity gene expression
there two major approaches detailed analysis local changes cells
one widely used method describe motion time
time change could also sequential specific region interest
although there approach area need define recent studies using explore dynamics region cells
indeed approach showed cell examined stochastic
second approach cellular defined
introduced active model known widely used analyze applications including
example et al used cell analyze specific proteins into leading
highly cell because does not require fixed necessary approach
recently developed framework using level set method various cells cells
although previous described specific aspects cellular there relationship between signaling events
one problem between regions different
dynamic relationship between change molecular signaling need them manner
system does not local domains cell
method cells consistent but its fixed number distribution when change growth neurons occurs
taking problems into account need novel method better understand mechanisms regulation molecular signaling
focused small signaling molecules associated cell
binary between active states play key biochemical signaling cellular behaviors through
well known unique specific structures
evidence obtained using role role cell
although some researchers notion variety cell our current study been view
objective study was relationship between changes cells
achieve needed data analysis between biochemical signaling
however do not focus complete signaling pathways cell
addition how changes cells rather than changes
findings will however because results compared findings
therefore first present algorithm called evolution local change
main features our method identification local change based area difference between two cell not characterized point but defined area past history future evolution each between
therefore method us complex cell while consistency during analysis
second energy three found significant between change activity
our study utility detailed cellular signal measure relationship between protein activity
