introduction
both evolution learning may considered different types adaptation
learning occurs within whereas genetic change occurs across
whereas genetic change task learning even most ability into useful
environment learning ability particular physical environment into each
if environment then genetic ability requires much learning into requires learning
more likely occur if cost learning high case computer simulations suggest learning rate genetic via effect
however if learning then genetic change may not occur at all
overall there between learning genetic learning genetic change especially if learning
all but most organisms learn order organisms learn at advantage relative those learn
therefore mechanism time required learn given advantage

below process learning one set associations another set associations usually learned
associations could either
before how evolution certain types will described its original context memory humans neural network models
note not unique specific class network although does assume associations learned using form learning
humans been demonstrated using task participants learned computer
after participants
was found
more recently set provided linear neural network models
occurs neural network models because each distributed all weights between
after some associations all weights values resulting performance even general provided
network two weights given 1
networks multiple input output considered without loss
used examine neural networks follows
network n input one output n weights
network set n associations where 1 2 two 1 2 n 1 n 2 associations
after associations been learned then performance error subset 1 measured
finally only 2 then performance error 1
occurs if 2 performance 1
been probability approaches number weights increases
learning 2 usually performance 2 paper
