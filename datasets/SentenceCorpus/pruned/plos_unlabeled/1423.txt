fundamental properties firing neurons usually characterized condition
noise neurons exhibit class lack firing current
neurons because they do not low
however show conditions response properties models
noise model response range associated model
like effect significantly classical behavior systems both temporal response pattern
instead being most signal classical system models most where
finding consistent fact there not input threshold terms rather response threshold more defined stimulus
call signals noise models because noise lower threshold stimuli
demonstrate here similar behaviors three models class presence noise suggest fundamental behavior associated general properties rather than particular biological mechanism
introduction
stochastic been described both systems example noise processing
involves noise dynamic state threshold while response signal
interaction signal noise response signal at value noise
here novel manner occur models
neurons characterized firing current input yet show responses signals
classical system often neurons signal without noise simply making its large
contrast neurons will not input even if signal very large making neurons framework study
our detailed results model been widely used modeling various neurons perform temporal processing only
then examine other types models our findings general
class used define responses different cellular mechanisms current current activation fast current
model our primary focus here type model i
same model previously shown noise neurons no response
although behavior seems consistent different below
classical system small amount noise signal threshold upon membrane threshold
when noise chosen signal more its
larger signal better whereas signals noise will only signal
sense call classical system stochastic
however neurons model depending noise but not very large noise
here report essential feature neurons response threshold better defined terms rather than input
further show signal signal its
neurons stochastic
study behavior distinct properties neurons
end first compare noise obtained model model
addition attention temporal firing patterns often when systems
next show behavior model highly relation feature firing rate increasing i been reported neurons models
finally threshold response stimulus observed conditions reduced addition noise
total report influence noise any performed neurons significantly distinct neurons
class often associated i i
far less strong i also class
show behavior observed models either i i when noise low
our present study our previous experimental results neurons different behaviors conditions compared their behaviors conditions
neurons being all conditions no noise present should conditions
