here examined whether functional disease
data subjects were obtained
analysis was applied data correlation matrices
correlation matrices were functional brain networks
were using graph methods
low frequency functional brain networks showed brain activity characterized high clustering low length
contrast functional brain networks showed loss properties characterized significantly lower clustering local connectivity
clustering were significantly lower group compared control group
furthermore clustering participants sensitivity percent percent
our study provides new evidence there functional brain networks
functional brain our findings further suggest network measures may useful
introduction
disease characterized memory other cognitive domains resulting
studies studies brain structure more recent studies regions brain function
most recently studies activation brain connectivity
functional connectivity defined temporal between distinct brain regions
studies connectivity measures shown patients connectivity during memory tasks
using demonstrated patients simple task had reduced functional connectivity within network brain regions network
et al reported connectivity during task subjects cognitive
three recent studies reported reduced network patients during tasks during classification task
et al also reported increased network subset less patients
addition functional connectivity during task performance functional connectivity also been investigated during conditions
functional connectivity signal
using approach et al found functional connectivity between several regions
et al reported reduced connectivity during conditions
most recently et al reported reduced functional connectivity network patients
although evidence functional between brain regions not clear whether global functional brain
graph clustering length useful measures global networks
graphs data structures nodes between nodes
clustering measure local network connectivity
network high average clustering characterized local clusters
length measure how well network network low length characterized short between any two nodes
network characterized high clustering low length
representation brain network brain region while functional interaction between two brain regions
functional connectivity networks human brain derived data exhibit characteristics
recent study et al reported functional networks brain
here examined global functional brain functional connectivity networks data networks using comparing characteristics between patients
global functional brain would
further given need test determine whether metric obtained data might provide specific
