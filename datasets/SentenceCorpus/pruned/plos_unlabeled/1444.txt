various mechanisms agents experimentally observed firing rate dynamics gene transcription
concentration was shown processes firing frequency gene expression system
model predicted direct relationship between firing frequency gene expression demonstrated importance pathways single cell behavior provided novel framework characteristics at both gene regulatory levels

although individual neurons contain molecular feedback membrane synaptic transmission also play significant
experimental studies demonstrated core activity molecular
organisms direct between membrane also been reported multiple studies evidence positive correlation between per gene transcription neural frequency output
example activation via leads lower firing rates
another example involves known lower both core genes neural firing
