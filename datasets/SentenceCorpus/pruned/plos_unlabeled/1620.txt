introduction
gene multiple gene among species gene
yeast genes single genes whose selected against protein highly essential proteins
similar relationships also species where genes highly essential proteins
one single particular gene towards
their because essential cellular functions between formation interactions
recent studies showed essential proteins different other species
human essential proteins involved development genes while other essential genes both
differences between human other species suggest gene during evolution likely related novel genes
through gene gene involved regulation signal protein protein
context been proposed higher connectivity may functional example through
however analysis types genes their during evolution how network properties proteins still
comparison gene network properties between species most approach whether gene indeed related gene
despite fact current protein still may include high recent interaction several species finally allows comparative network analyses
example comparison human yeast networks showed they similar structure despite difference size
addition their connectivity proteins central also essential
studies demonstrate comparison protein gene properties different species used general evolutionary
when differences between network properties during evolution comparative analysis genes networks four species yeast human
species different levels complexity defined number genes cells cell types also high quality genomic interaction data
compare connectivity all proteins corresponding genes
identify core whose properties constant human another group during evolution
our analysis provides evidence how properties during evolution genetic cancer terms network
particular find cancer genes two groups human one early evolution genes other later genes
two groups two different ways at different times during evolution
