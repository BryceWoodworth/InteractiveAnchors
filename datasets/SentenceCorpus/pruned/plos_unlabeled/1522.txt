introduction
important step genetic regulatory network cell identify dna binding sites each transcription factor protein genome
typically genes specific dna sequences
although other factors binding interactions affect gene expression important identify sequences directly best our ability understand genes
better understanding gene regulation central role cellular responses environmental changes key cellular behavior variety useful metabolic applications
number computational methods been developed predicting binding sites given set known binding sites
used methods involve sequence weight matrix where dna binding sites represented sequences t c
more approaches further set potential binding sites given addition each free energy protein binding additional relevant information correlation between different sequence binding
not widely used sequence analysis idea structural data predicting binding sites been considered
most methods use structures rather than dna itself
training sets large useful even only small sets known binding sites typically available
new been used identify large numbers binding sites particular but there remains need methods predict binding sites given small number positive examples
methods used example analysis data
binding sites methods compared predicted binding sites studies at importance sites gene expression
structure dna sequence dependent interactions depend various parameters between amino residues base pair
parameters not methods predicting binding sites rely sequence information
dna sequences do not underlying interactions
