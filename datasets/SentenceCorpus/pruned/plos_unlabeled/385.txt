stable environment cells complex systems against variety etc type many adaptive mechanisms cellular appear through gene regulatory networks into negative feedback
general degree variables proteins 2 first molecules then signal specific transcription factors
transcription factors expression genes many variables
objective study was explore using control theory computational approaches theoretical basis response relationship between cellular biochemical species gene regulatory networks
our work response depends changes specific values local response distributed feedback
transcription factors into even play significant role robust
moreover our simulation response variables transition through four distinct level initial control more highly linear
each phase specific events into play level increases
region depending level local gains presence events degree gene activation region appear even
general response transition proposed here was further examined complex pathway involves multiple genes metabolic reactions
work would help especially better predict cellular impact about biological
introduction
cells must relatively stable environment potentially
many need within normal cell functions
examples biochemical species could cellular health species dna proteins 2
when molecules their extended time normal cell functions become cell cycle may
regulation biochemical species via gene regulatory networks specifically particular types
many control gene regulatory networks usually into negative feedback into common control
output system variable biochemical species therefore
system contains specific transcription factors either directly sense level variable
concentration variable affect activity transcription factor
transcription factors then expression individual genes many biochemical reactions variable
control dynamic system theory applied many recent years increasing been made apply similar biological systems including adaptive responses
our goal understand design principle cellular improve prediction effects biological
practical importance risk at cellular level response relationship between levels various biochemical including variables transcription factors gene expression
cell responses region particularly relevant human health risk difficult explain predict response behaviors region due uncertainty
describe understand complex response behaviors underlying biochemical networks will examined through quantitative models
respect mathematical approaches involved theoretical development quantitative analysis biochemical networks including metabolic control analysis biochemical systems theory value
using numerical simulation classical control theory present study focused understanding quantitative basis response gene regulatory network
while some presented paper may even they provide important framework especially improve accuracy they evaluate influence biological control processes under different conditions
