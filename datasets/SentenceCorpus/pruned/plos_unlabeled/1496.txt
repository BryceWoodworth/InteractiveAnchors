introduction
universal understanding brain complex space time more than experimental its dynamics
better understand its function one not only complexity but also estimate variables parameters brain dynamics
comparison forecasting although dynamics less complex less
some using model based whose development derived computational
system computational model system data through what may relatively sparse estimate variables parameters available data
result future measured system dynamics compared model predicted outcome expected errors within model process
initial value problem one computational models high dynamics natural systems modeling within model measurements
most model based strategies
its original form linear system
situations extended were used where system could without too much nature system
not systems scale action potential
efficient techniques along computational models dynamics systems based systems now strong
general framework extended fundamental models directly along error noise through
instead system prediction potential system states

dynamics networks further fact variety metabolic processes those networks metabolic variables not directly using potential measurements
indeed not describe wide variety
several prediction algorithms based only signals accuracy when applied
however many techniques high positive rates them use
there aspects dynamics states not current models when applied
dynamic nature approach time evolution underlying system prediction required
one cannot see much dynamics prior same variety system up states firing addition human
all properties they following small stimuli both events
recently been shown dynamics formula concentration affect neurons help determine affect stability states activity
between intrinsic produce similar what observed
brain dynamics within system unique complexity among natural systems
even complex spatial extent brain networks will require through modeling
since at present our us only one two variables at number sites computational models become through must consider all brain measurements
what follows will show potential power physiological measurements computational models
will use account system metabolic processes cellular cellular against actual measurements
