fundamental human perception yet why see them still focus much research
here address question not human perception directly typically case but our natural visual world need robust
neural networks were predict under
networks learned solve task given only sense data
addition direct their experience networks also made errors their human contrast although only when
also found human perception were observed contrast
data suggest humans because natural stimuli statistical relationship between past visual experience
since stimulus all visual systems findings human must all visual their particular neural
data also provide more condition true source stimulus what its most likely source
not different all being direct statistical relationship between
introduction
understanding how generate accurate often best understanding why do not
thus essential tools research
many natural environments levels across space over time
important able order example
number models perception been proposed but most complex stimuli only demonstrate range
instance one heuristic model predicts human first stimuli into multiple local based instance analysis well other factors
then within each framework maximum local framework used predict large area rule
rules effective simple stimuli but application rule not been studied more complex
indeed see how model could applied even complex stimuli much less natural under without complex rules yet
furthermore heuristics provide little into physiological computational relevant all visual
more computational approaches other hand less more quantitative make assumptions
example neural networks been information object simple statistical approach using sampling markov random been used simple
most models however explain contrast without one more factors
one approach model
set model results results wide range stimuli
same model however predict contrast where larger than discuss later
while not model different gain parameters applied independent would first step differences
also important model does not predict only perceived stimulus therefore explain more natural under
related machine work changes into those those using mixture mixture set been used intrinsic components image including
however studies do not explain human perception
thus why how see
here take different approach human perception generally
rather than human perception known most models instead model empirical process most fundamental visual visual stimuli
make no assumptions about particular but instead model process stimuli feedback environment
learning any whose must learn order
