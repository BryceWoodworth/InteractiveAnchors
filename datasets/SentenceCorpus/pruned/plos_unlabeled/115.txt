g protein about percent human genes family membrane proteins cell signal into cellular response
although structural information function drug design there few experimentally determined structures
address issue recently developed method generate structure predictions all human genome
modeling approaches modeling does not require moreover often structures
features essential modeling all human when close
based confidence predicted models should correct
models but predicted different structures
due domains well database errors
our modeling only protein data
model global c region
models several compared data consistent demonstrated
structure clustering predicted models shows similar structures tend similar functional class even when their sequences
results demonstrate robustness models functional analysis
all predicted models available our site
introduction
g protein membrane proteins cell signals cells response stimuli 2 amino proteins many physiological functions through their interaction g proteins
many involve making them important drug targets
human estimated number corresponding about percent total number human genes
however more than percent all target represent percent
while knowledge structure important information understanding its function drug design structures been
two major techniques used determine protein structures
protein does not need information
however high proteins yet no complete structure been method
provide very information proteins but difficult
fact only single membrane been
significant number structures will experimentally very future
situation use approaches drug design research into mechanisms control binding activation regulation signal
demonstrated recent experiments methods structure protein its amino sequence been
among three types structure prediction algorithms modeling models target sequence related structure provides most accurate models
however its evolutionary relationship between target proteins
example proteins greater than percent sequence their models tend close structure 1 their experiments
when sequence below percent model accuracy because lack significant structure alignment errors
here models provided often model based rather than structure sequence interest
been significant problem
among all human there only four sequences sequence greater than percent
percent human average sequence percent comparative modeling
recently developed algorithms
test proteins protein data after having greater than percent sequence target two single domain proteins models c less than
significant over modeling many models respect their
additional structures modeling may provide best alternative structural information
work predict structures all sequences human genome less than amino length
only sequence given no other knowledge into our structure prediction approach
because may occur ability most important advantage using modeling
also distinct many other modeling methods only model regions predictions regions
tests percent four more residues models global less than
contrast using widely used modeling accuracy percent
if one only accuracy itself then percent local less than average up residues below
especially important modeling often critical
therefore models over comparative modeling methods likely greater understanding signaling interactions
