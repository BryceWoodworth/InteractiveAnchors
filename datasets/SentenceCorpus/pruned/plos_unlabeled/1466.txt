question molecular biology extent behavior observed their behavior
number experimental techniques now allow behavior individual types studied directly however allow wide range types observed
order issue computational perspective having selected model test system detailed model its environment most types at experimentally measured
dynamics simulations model been protein observed simulation been used effects protein events
simulation model relative proteins measured e shows effects additional effect must understand behavior
introduction
while studies important into properties functions biological research attention being at extent behavior observed likely
physiological setting all must experience interactions there good theoretical even if interactions only nature significant may result
order allow directly therefore number important been made experimental
alternative use experimental techniques molecular model environment use molecular simulation techniques explore its if model could shown if would important advantage direct observation all molecules system
fact at least two simulation studies model been reported number results
both previous studies however all molecules therefore simulations include detailed models might lead additional
strategy chosen test system quantitative structural data first detailed molecular model
