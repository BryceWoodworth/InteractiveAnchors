while many point mutations most experimentally generated point mutations biological changes described literature

problem point mutation point mutation its associated protein
our algorithm uses identify relevant associations protein database information
graph method different other models point mutation frequency data all terms article point mutation protein
our method was tested point mutations g protein receptor kinase protein
our graph metric against metric term datasets literature three different protein
our testing shows graph metric higher protein
situations where more than one protein point mutation required graph metric compared distance metric
graph search metric significant over previous search point mutation application words
introduction
high biological value complex biological systems
tools become part analysis datasets
when complex data analysis
when data distributed must strategy must develop tools literature relevant information
online developed need but they difficult scale
biological field identify information literature database
two types tasks biological gene protein interactions between proteins
was focused additional task functional
other applications focus hypothesis protein pathway discovery
recent work also focused protein point mutations literature
protein point mutations amino one important our understanding protein function evolutionary relationships genetic
functional perspective researchers introduce point mutations into proteins importance particular protein function
evolution upon mutations dna mechanism protein sequences
while term mutation used changes means difference within species point mutation different amino reference amino
human gene mutation database two many point mutations their effects
input into database information represented but does complex information difficult tools
task point mutation into two
first necessary identify protein mutation terms discussed within article
after identified must made between point mutation its correct protein
problem when paper single protein but complex when multiple proteins present
our evaluation mutation graph related kinase protein
using our protein term identification method out total point mutation could multiple proteins
few methods point mutation been developed
et al describe method called mutations
describe method called mutation point mutation into protein structure application
our own group presented point mutation method applied g protein receptor receptor literature
use search identify distance between multiple protein terms
both methods while simple method point mutation were limited two
first distance not always correct between protein terms
second was set more limited than article
our literature set only percent point mutations found full
point mutations were also against only contains point mutations
was receptor literature algorithm protein amino cases
mutation approaches problem
method proteins organisms point mutations using analysis at level
pair if both patterns
method would work well if all point mutations were described associated proteins organisms at level observed not always case
mutation also protein sequence information but use protein structures mutation information instead point mutation
our method mutation using novel graph metric frequency terms between proteins information
like mutation protein database sequence contains more sequence variation than
utility our application algorithm all protein our method three different protein family literature sets
more detailed mutation described section
our task point mutations protein terms not sufficient protein must also find its correct gene corresponding database
problem its correct gene
solutions methods approaches combination both
some methods may not our point mutation task
participants were provided large set under three different human yeast
some solutions learning training data each then learned functions test set also
approach our task two
first because point mutations at protein family level methods protein would not analysis across many species
second our goal point mutation any proteins
approaches large detailed training sets
our experience involved amount necessary learn protein family specific scale presented likely point mutation
methods features identification generally perform at lower than methods machine learning
however since methods do not require training data they when data difficult
our approach protein term identification similar other approaches
first using proteins protein protein their
terms then literature
depending length terms search different levels
