neural field model presented essential characteristics activity dynamics across several visual response local stimuli
account physiological data obtained population activity at high
single single studies showed before motion within
consider neural field model neurons system
under assumption activity both our model observed activity patterns
moreover model novel similar stimuli activity different
our results feedback higher brain not required produce motion patterns case
physiological model suggests signal may due activity notion interactions between populations play major role dynamic stimulus early visual
introduction
visual activity does not visual input but rather additional processes involving local feedback
understanding processing requires theoretical understanding underlying activity dynamics modeling at various levels
chosen level should level at made
activity patterns observed using population activity at level
suggests application models large numbers neurons
moreover relation dynamics spatial
neural field models synaptic depends notion distance between neurons neurons therefore our choice
here show models mean data space time high accuracy
model functional description dynamics
thus first place
however its biological terms allows its structure parameters functional
data model two stimuli presented produce pattern signals activity across representation early visual
obtained pattern was different activity when was did not simple stimuli
rather observed activity was also found when stimulus visual space
based data neural field model account findings i
if so would feedback higher brain not produce motion patterns across primary visual upon
measures relative changes correlated changes membrane
technique allows activity at well level at least temporal spatial across several
hence well dynamics neurons at
however signal does not between overall activity
therefore our model explicitly signal mixture activity populations thus studies data activity
gain about relative signal because model allows its
following first describe underlying data its our model structure our parameter identification procedure
then present results including model comparison further models model prediction similar yet novel stimuli results standard linear stability analysis solution model
then findings relation alternative modeling approaches physiological our model role model
finally consider our results context representation motion
