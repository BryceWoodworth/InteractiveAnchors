introduction
since often suggested our perception objects world us what they
if had place their they would objects able whether was intrinsic objects just our perception
version position one may argue perception visual objects always visual pathway particular intrinsic primary visual
fact any visual input processing before
instance intrinsic our perception will physical
training without feedback may still improve our certain about empirical view
how then possible more just dynamics without being about between true physical quality
show model during learning intrinsic
leads representation input
underlying mechanisms example
example test visual context
biases perception test
presence test perceived than actually perception when elements against some
however when task comparing test single reference then comparison
test because underlying population test within corresponding population
show input bias within
representation test perception
additional gain increase further sensitivity differences
learning change perception following typically either synaptic pathway within
because synaptic would affect any input through however learning would information processing other situations
although negative learning other tasks known appear learning typically does not perception other see
while between test reference instance detection expected not
fact required integration
hence models learning explain how one task possible without others
learning might based input change input
taking up idea show how signaling higher area could processing lower area consistent both experiments learning
