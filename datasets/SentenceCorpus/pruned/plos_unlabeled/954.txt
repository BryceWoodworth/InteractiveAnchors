novel found brain regions well other
approach will impact our understanding associated pathways help identify new targets drug development
introduction
g protein represent gene family making up percent genome
proteins made up several including class class b class c other
within each class there very large number smaller family within
there more than family
large number been identified only computational methods while others been into however receptor functions many unknown
any receptor unknown considered receptor
all some
large family proteins important not only basic perspective but because their sites action importance first cellular signaling become primary target drug development
fact over percent all either
many new will lead new drug development new agents
although identification relatively discovery far more difficult
exist small molecules proteins
many may important functions other than
even within class there identify new
particularly true within family they larger species known
amino residues
they found within larger protein actual usually follows specific rules
proteins each signal sequence necessary protein out complex into processing where signal sequence
general pair basic residues found directly
basic residues recognition sites processing usually active
many cases there more than single active within one protein
even common features identification dna protein sequence very difficult
even though all related based upon dna protein sequence only related within
instance family four
similar genomic structures very similarity protein sequence most
however if one were search dna sequences similar one would not find any other
simple search strategies within not novel especially those not known
there additional feature may more them other types molecules
usually well conserved among various species while sequences because they simply not well conserved
here describe novel hidden markov model based computational framework method identification based upon approach models spatial structure along genomic sequence temporal evolutionary structure across species show how models used new functional molecules via sequence
computational was used identify novel up four potential
