recent times stochastic gene regulatory processes literature cell signaling its environment specific protein through network reactions
stochastic nature process leads distribution protein levels population cells determined
often occurs two state protein levels one at low end state other at high end state given concentration signaling within range
been distributions two different populations one state other state
distribution about stochastic analysis single cell
however action population concentration environment individual cells hence their behavior only appropriate population model effects interaction between population its environment
study show how population model stochastic gene expression individual cells
simulation model shows sufficient necessary distributions population
original notion distribution single cell stochastic model therefore only special population model
introduction
study cell populations distribution measures cell populations application theory population
population framework et al provided modeling same
while recognition generally exists literature modeling gene regulatory processes been at single cell level based being average cell
since gene regulatory processes typically involve small number molecules reaction network stochastic its dynamics feature single cell analysis
further issue importance occurs when two levels gene expression one high other low exist given concentration signaling
issue very much part stochastic modeling single cell
several stochastic models been two them been used stochastic simulation algorithm stochastic
stochastic model model only behavior large populations without behaviors different cells
been studied through experiments theoretical analysis numerical simulations
system characterized existence two stable states
two stable states appear distribution population
distribution been shown many
however almost all modeling stochastic gene regulation processes at level
outcome single cell behavior been population behavior
cell assumed other cells without fact signaling environment action all population
no interaction between other cells been taken into models could indeed lead bias
single cell model may population approach
detailed general framework application population populations was developed et al
however population model work many others literature based behavior
shows how random behavior described stochastic
study demonstrate stochastic gene regulation time evolution behavior cell population
system been study example critical difference between stochastic gene regulation stochastic model
our objective paper population models stochastic gene expression single cells
further explore under distributions observed protein particular investigate generally view literature protein distribution occur
view work who showed distributions without when reaction time gene regulation short relative time required change dna
other similar also found literature
while show distributions without must their based differences behavior single cells
study approach issue relationship between rational examine nature protein distribution cells without within framework population
thus will investigated distributions without distributions even when exists
