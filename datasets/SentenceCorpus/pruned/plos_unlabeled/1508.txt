system been information about stimuli particular about source
however simple time differences way neurons might information potential computational unknown
computational difficulty task source two signals highly dependent unknown source signal
models found structure patterns depend source rather than source signal
patterns would then result activation neurons
designed model principle variety sources environment using measured human functions
model was able estimate previously unknown both known environment
found multiple different environments could sets neural could associated spatial learning
model computational relative spatial information about sources source signal
introduction
must able estimate source example
task because signals at two both source signal environment information about source must other
studies shown source variety cues time level differences cues
at level been shown information about stimuli particular about source
although well responses unknown how information could neurons
addition potential computational task
s produced source presence body other aspects environment
results two signals s s at two where depends relative position source
because two signals obtained same source signal stimulus particular structure source
when signals into structure into patterns
therefore examined patterns models where signals were obtained using variety sources through measured human functions
then model neurons both so patterns structure activation neurons
model was able source activation neural way was independent source signal
several models mechanisms at level
also been understanding physiological mechanisms cue particular neural mechanisms underlying sensitivity
studies used stimuli noise
several computational models address full problem environment although do not suggest how neurons might perform task
here propose neural model full task more situation based idea structural properties stimuli setting source
