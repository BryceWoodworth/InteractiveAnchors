binding 2 may allows kinase activity even upon 2
recently novel activation pathway was identified where at specific residues regulatory results activity independent

our computer simulations show activity due increased leads increased at
our results identify activation potential between after
furthermore our findings support potential
finally important note activation allows independent regulation kinase unique signaling potential human disease
