gene regulatory networks direct interactions but also include interactions signaling molecules
describe how interactions derived model underlying biochemical reaction network using assumptions combination sensitivity metabolic control analysis
apply approach model network
our results show derived gene regulatory network what usually assumed
moreover network interactions fixed biochemical reactions specific parameter values rate
following change growth conditions may affect interactions though
leads feedback structure at same time robust changes properties changes environment
introduction
adaptation changes their environment involves expression genes membrane etc
gene regulatory networks expression clusters related genes
interactions network may direct case gene transcription factor expression another gene
most time however regulatory interactions when gene
gene regulatory network thus not reduced its regulatory interactions metabolic signaling pathways may feedback system
network good example because signal gene expression
at level gene expression network feedback interactions between
global like control expression while latter pathways control expression global
instance produce required activation
aim paper develop method direct interactions gene regulatory network underlying biochemical reaction network
due complexity metabolic signaling networks interactions difficult general
show model reduction based assumptions system together sensitivity metabolic control analysis able interactions
indeed allows individual reactions
therefore provides framework metabolic effects gene regulation
apply our approach model part network e pathways their genetic metabolic regulation
analysis derived gene regulatory network leads three new
first what often assumed network due feedback resulting interactions
additional complexity important issue correct data studies
second derived gene regulatory network e sense interactions fixed information biochemical reactions without rate parameter values
therefore feedback structure robust changes properties other biochemical reactions species
third change environmental conditions may thus interactions resulting dynamic regulatory network
