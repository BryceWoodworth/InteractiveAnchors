elements sequences make up significant genomes
despite their importance genome biology most genome sequences rely results single computational program
contrast recent gene gene models produced multiple independent sources computational evidence
quality level gene models developed combined systems used gene results multiple identification methods

introduction
elements dna sequences dynamic component genomes
distribution they been found all organisms studied few
represent important components genome sequences there no genomic dna close
show high species number types differ between even related organisms
there evidence may between species mechanisms
dynamics within species also effects elements their genomes
individual may lead genome mutations genes changes gene regulation
some may even become play normal functions
despite their effects understand very little about most aspects biology
one way our knowledge biology through computational analysis number complete genomic sequences
detailed comparison distribution genomes fundamental biological properties differ among species
however about biology based derived only if about results analyses
strong result computational biology should its robustness particular method used
however typically results single computational program recent studies may most efficient most approach
contrast recent field gene gene models produced multiple independent sources computational evidence
recent development several new methods detection now possible apply similar combined evidence approach quality level gene models
achieve aim developed results multiple identification methods
our uses combined computational evidence derived previously
designed our system use framework genome computational evidence efficient manner produce models
allows complex models key structural allow into highly elements
contrast simply our method provides means complete accurate multiple sources computational evidence goal important experimental studies genome biology
test case chosen genomic sequence
genome sequence d among quality genome sequences particularly well sequence studies since dna sequences been high quality analysis
moreover d set used
tests performed here sequence show approach performance over individual detection methods larger genome than previously estimated
applied our new sequence several extended sequence regions produce d genome
now estimated at percent found higher number than previously identified
also estimated into at least one other elements
our other genome sequences could increase genomic regions complex sequences
