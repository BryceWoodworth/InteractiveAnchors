genomic study
sequencing ability sequence directly their our view world
information new genomic sequences
genomic data single making sequence
data more than species sequence data being
sampling gene function prediction new often sequence data
although relative past few years seen computational methods applied research
therefore not within article provide review
rather provide here yet introduction current computational presented review recent made
also note whether there any methods presented here review its utility
would useful if article would themselves section provided their own
finally section article provides few studies different recent made using
introduction
most its history life life life still many aspects
estimated cells our some making them those
all environments other life many cases c found
according some estimates
not only they essential all life they primary source primary available form
along all other human condition affected human few
humans more cells our body than our own cells
been key understanding human condition understanding human genome
but given our relationship human genome now necessary though sequencing genomes our own would necessary too
also better understand role would necessary genomic study them well
study genomes sequencing genomes
major step sequencing first genome
genomes species
having hand large number genomes nature evolution studies
ability examine relationship genome structure function across many different species data also up comparative systems biology
single genome studies
first mean must first sequence its genome
however only small nature means genomic data highly do not represent true genomes species
second very do single species species both each other their may also include organisms
therefore also represent true state nature respect interaction resulting population genomic biological functions
new sequencing reduction cost sequencing us
now ability obtain genomic information directly their natural
instead at few species able study all together
sequence data taken directly environment were study sequence data directly environment
however environmental sequencing its own
single all genome complete genome
know species dna rna
after genes
control elements other cues identified
achieve complete all genomic elements
may not all elements what they some errors may but our knowledge those genome
contrast sequences obtained environmental genomic studies
each was specific species but there many different species single sample most full genome not available
many cases determine true species
length each between base pairs depending sequencing method used
short sequence their original species usually not whole genome generally not possible
even
addition being sequence data environmental sequencing several larger than single
computational been new algorithms analyze data
computational new very
first genomic almost two
whole allows us examine evolution not only single genes but whole cellular networks
but more recently us ability study most fundamental genomic level relationship between they
how does adaptation different environments including other itself their genomes
us humans question very close when those our own associated our own almost every human life well life every other being affected
now experimental understand how they affect us but nature data computational all data into useful information
article some experimental computational associated data sequence through various levels
will also discuss computational unique environmental size associated
finally will review some studies research some
