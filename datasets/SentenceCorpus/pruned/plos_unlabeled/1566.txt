observed between intrinsic specific interactions provides us into dynamics functional evolution domain
introduction
many proteins molecular
they function because their structure allows them changes while their biological functions
changes been out proteins simple approaches
yet amino another important property interactions specific
overall exists between properties specific properties must achieve
between two effects particularly important case number proteins domains play role variety interactions
domain family proteins example
domain critical role molecular turn accurate either proteins their protein
family contain two domain domain each activity via effects
at domain increases thus other hand produced upon its new therefore rate
regulation domain basis activity
domain involves interaction two also called proteins factors significantly increasing rate
molecular understanding function requires analysis structural basis mechanism interaction
here focus interaction their domain
domain four i
central between two at between effects its binding domain
four classes been
their structures exhibit variety binding interactions domain
present study examine interactions using sequence structure identify their features
our analysis provides into specific aspects interactions well molecular sequence design highly domain thus robust dynamics properties highly correlated amino changes specific recognition
