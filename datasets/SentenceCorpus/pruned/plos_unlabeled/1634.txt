introduction
responses organisms environment important both terms understanding its potential impact global health
although computational systems been application systems biology approaches organisms general due limited sequence information relevant species
moreover number samples information available often limited there may lack relevant physiological
thus effective finding responses organisms model experiments but environment greater present complex responses will dependent upon natural life history other environmental factors

although previously shown expression response genes could used environmental sampling sites different underlying little health outcomes molecular differences

provides useful model network biology approach generally species way study mechanisms organisms environment
our towards molecular networks populations environments including significantly

networks identified demonstrate between human environmental effects well potentially novel adaptation mechanisms
application network biology approaches other species environment therefore likely change our understanding how systems likely complex environments
