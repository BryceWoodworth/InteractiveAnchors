perception involves two types decisions about identification stimulus features same stimulus features among set alternatives
judgment been two distinct computational problems
here found two types decision making mechanism
used continuous network model two experiments subjects were required make either choice judgment about direction motion
model network population activity patterns each possible motion direction
evidence its strong leads decision behaviors
model performance well activity task
furthermore examined how direction identification determined combination
using measure found direction judgments when two stimuli far vector when two stimuli close each other
range between two stimuli network strategy sense direction estimates produced some trials vector other trials model prediction experimentally
work thus support common framework both judgment decision making
introduction
judgments involve detection identification objects
given visual motion pattern instance subject may asked whether motion direction present identify motion direction motion direction between two options
using strategy activity judgments
experiments using tasks neural decision making been observed
experimental observations neural models suggest network dynamics temporal integration information decision formation
those neural models well models typically simple neural alternatives
therefore they identification requires neural representation motion direction arbitrary between
other hand probabilistic estimation stimulus feature been studied perspective optimal population
studies optimal algorithms out stimulus feature neural populations visual stimulus neural activity primary visual direction motion stimulus activity across temporal visual area
however probabilistic inference occur primary underlying mechanism remains
particular unknown whether probabilistic estimation distinct decision processes neural mechanism
present work investigated question using continuous network model neurons was proposed spatial memory
applied model simulation two experiments using visual motion stimuli
direction task was motion direction making one two choice targets
was found activity neurons correlated choice
contrast direction identification task was required report its perceived direction motion visual stimulus
some trials was applied neurons when
could bias judgments direction neurons at site
was both algorithms might activity neurons
but only behavioral data did not neural activity
thus neural mechanism judgments about motion direction remains unknown
here show continuous network model observations both experiments
our results suggest both judgment common dynamics
