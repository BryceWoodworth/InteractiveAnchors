introduction
following work effort been into neural network models particularly form neural field models
some network models particular early visual system been developed account particular physiological data
however strongly networks few network models directly specific data been identified
instead most work been network models focused features stability patterns other structures see
here present new method identification specific population network models apply method network models signal processing based data system analyze identified models using techniques systems analysis
our study large differences function between compared between thus direct how stimuli population system
models generally been lack relevant experimental data test models
single generally only measure firing activity individual neurons not activity populations cells typically predicted population models
et al thus developed models signal based data
contrast provide all at one more
signal at each contact potential generated synaptic action neurons within few contact where factors depend position neurons well properties
present paper describe new method population models both basis data using linear system
so called population analysis et al data estimate populations population firing rates following firing particular population
population were further used estimate synaptic patterns between various populations using both current source density estimation techniques new technique
here use firing rates populations estimated using combination firing activity identify population models
models systems sets more common mathematical representation models
population responses were found increase both increasing
stimulus set both time was found provide variety responses thus well between models
optimal model structure corresponding model parameters estimated between population firing rates predicted models experimentally population firing rates
first focus estimation mathematical models signal between population population input
our experimental data model fast process combination interactions activation function
identified seen property frequency domain responses population obtained firing rates
very different population models identified population activity
present experimental firing rates various populations found exhibit strong temporal simple models linear activation function found account data
functional properties identified network models thus very while changes firing rate
results were presented
