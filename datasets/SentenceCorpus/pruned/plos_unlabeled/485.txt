much 2 percent percent sequence generated part genome sequencing not part genome sequences due its highly nature
here develop computational methods sequences previously sequence data
present algorithm predict potential structure based sequence data then experimentally its distribution experimental analyses
using data human genomes examine relationship sequences provide further support model their evolution mutation over years
our results fundamental differences evolution world evolution
introduction
only functional dna sequence associated all human
sequence
humans two distinct based their sequence properties
humans large into where size
while individual human show percent percent variation sequence between typically less than 2 percent
number within any between different human individuals source length
dna between pairs between during differences thought fundamental evolution
specific each human individual into one different based their sequence properties
studies related particular associations do not among structure dna changes very over relatively short evolutionary time
addition large dna more recently been described any structure
individual within show sequence been dna
at dna
some regions been because they transition regions between
probabilistic analyses suggest dna more recently existing sequence having local dna
regions sequence
regions generally too difficult sequence sequence
however most sequencing include sequence
indeed much 2 percent percent sequence generated underlying sequences data most often database
study develop computational methods identify sequences sequence
predict novel structures genomes define relationship sequences within context known human sequences
finally take advantage available experimentally described sequences within various genomes
data provide first sequence analysis dna among data framework identify more complex regions genomes part genome sequencing
