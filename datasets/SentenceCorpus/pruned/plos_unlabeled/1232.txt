family proteins human genome involved many complex signal pathways typically binding subject
class family known binding site although effects receptor not yet been described
effort understand effects performed scale molecular dynamics simulations d 2 receptor finding receptor at site
presence at site conformational change one found state human 2 receptor
study provides detailed quantitative information about binding d 2 receptor important conformational change d 2 receptor function
introduction
highly signal able stimulus signaling pathways
recent research field complexity mechanisms involved far being
among mechanisms central role signaling
experimental study regulatory processes difficult because techniques provide structural information sufficient spatial time scales specific aspects interactions
computational methods like molecular dynamics simulation used provide unique into some aspects problem terms both spatial time scale needed
present work application long simulations effect class mechanism involved their role
class family been used drug targets treatment central system
been studied experimentally receptor d 2 d
been proposed site region below binding site
high among suggests its structural importance function
group via interaction
indeed introduction residues position d 2 d presence negative site essential sensitivity
et al proposed binding site network
however experimental information available molecular mechanism activation remains unknown
effort mechanism effect investigated d 2 receptor
molecular dynamics simulations d 2 receptor were performed analyze more than s simulation data
analysis single s long simulation one simulations simulations accurate free energy
simulation into d 2 receptor receptor its into network binding site receptor
most analysis all showed correlation between position
part so called set residues known major conformational change upon activation
propose based experimental data conformational state affected binding site particular receptor response
our study shows conformational state also site conformational state structure experimentally derived 2 receptor
