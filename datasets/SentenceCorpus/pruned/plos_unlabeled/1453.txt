introduction
proteins percent proteins genome involved wide variety important biological processes including cell molecules cell recognition
many also drug targets been estimated more than all target membrane proteins
despite significant predict protein little attention been method together
since region common alignment task should principle than predicting proteins constraints solution space three two
however large numbers well structural features including simple approaches may work proteins predict now present structural
early predict protein were based sequence similarity proteins known structure using derived environmental preference parameters combined experimentally determined features
another method amino residues membrane proteins where was
comparing observed obtained sequence regions residues could predicted
combination method could then presence residues used construct model
other methods also made use prediction combination existing framework protein structure prediction involving over selection
however methods were only were other
more recently version protein structure prediction method was model proteins
based structural using algorithm order search conformational space highly protein structures
membrane potential energy terms was derived statistical analysis data set proteins experimentally defined
results obtained method small membrane proteins known structure showed could predict both at accuracy level
despite good results complexity protein methods means use approaches large structures many than residues
another protein program energy function described membrane interactions at level membrane interactions while explicitly
results suggest model essential physical properties stability proteins structures small protein domains up residues predicted less than
recent algorithm demonstrated at particular based local each proteins more complex could within structure
prediction interactions derived only recently been investigated proteins due relative protein structures
contrast number protein contact exist based variety machine learning algorithms contact prediction also been used protein models critical structure prediction experiment
however analysis shown proteins contact perform when applied proteins most likely due differences between interaction motifs
number studies identified structural sequence motifs during interaction proteins
one pairs according their similarity three pairs into one motifs
small every residues while structures showed similar tendency though at
another study identified specific pattern was demonstrated interactions during while others include found motifs residues residues through formation
discovery motifs likelihood there more yet suggests pattern search strategy
recently two methods been developed predict interaction
uses neural network combination data information predicted using method number protein specific features position within order predict interaction
uses approach combination support vector machine classifier
first level between per basis before second level structure contact all possible pairs predicted contact residues therefore high computational cost growth pair prediction
here present novel method predict interactions finally optimal proteins
using molecular dynamics data residues potentially classifier predict per percent accuracy
information combined data variety features additional predict
results information able predict interaction up percent accuracy under test set protein
then tested ability method using set structures
comparing our predictions test set were able identify up percent accuracy
all performance significant over existing methods
order global approach
algorithm method while length attributes common structures
finally genetic algorithm used order across
