many proteins especially contain several domains same family
variety binding properties involved protein protein interactions well binding other dna rna
protein domain assumed through
however exact mechanisms not
here studied evolution function protein structure gene structure distribution domain
domain more domain regions
previous findings particular contain much higher proteins compared
sequence similarity each protein revealed domain often through several domains at time while one domain less common
many appear been region
strong contrast evolution other proteins through single domains at either
further found some domain show distinct patterns domains been domains at time while other domain involve numbers domains
finally no common mechanism all could
found patterns show no size domains
further some
however could not all
introduction
proteins domains protein distinct structure function evolutionary history
protein domains may occur but more found combination other domains proteins
while new through protein domains been studied during few years one type domain often been domain
domain contain two more domains same domain family
large more then domains common
domains often short family residues
some domain found while other also found single
may form structures while others form only upon binding their
some examples protein structures found database
single amino short motifs may proteins too
however study focused larger domains
therefore when protein domains
domain often involved interactions proteins other dna rna
even if domains conserved structure sequence often low only few conserved residues required correct
their variable sequences variation number domains provide binding multiple binding
hence found proteins highly functions involved regulation regulation protein protein
addition binding properties sequence been high alternative
domain found all life long several domains been observed particularly common species
been proposed provide source low rates
one example systems new
domain thought via within gene where next its
however exact mechanism phenomenon not
regions may issue been study
another possible dna due formation dna common short protein
however shown protein more likely than dna since shows length
addition genes genomes
part explain their higher
addition variation number between genes domains evolution
could several domains
study aim investigate how multiple domains
further number domains compared among different domain
domains defined database were using
was increased detection domains regions proteins
addition domain been used study distribution domain three life position
