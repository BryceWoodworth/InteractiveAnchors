protein short two stable secondary structural proteins play critical role protein structure function
protein between points without any remains open
variety algorithms been developed problem approaches known protein structures
however many approaches focus fixed end point condition constraints
present work describe simple solution not only end point conditions but also constraints
random initial each individual generated using simple distance chosen fast matching components amino
method simple stable efficient
very additional constraints those derived experiments into algorithm way making method more complex problems
performance robustness algorithm demonstrated set protein length been used previous studies
introduction
protein structures their essential understanding function proteins biological processes they
however due their conformational difficult determine their structure via experimental techniques
result structures not protein data
sequence structure protein also major modeling
sequence good quality experimental structures generally obtain overall structure some degree question
however errors could significant regions where sequences between target protein differ significantly
our view problem protein between two fixed end points remains
solution problem will not only experimental structure comparative modeling but also useful protein structure prediction phase space sampling importance local without system been demonstrated molecules
complete solution protein problem usually involves two important components structure selection most through appropriate function
current study problem
variety algorithms been developed problem
many methods construct protein database experimentally determined protein structures
methods highly dependent size quality experimental data their performance growth
more since number possible increases length approach limited relatively short
not problem methods construct either existing structures structures molecular dynamics random sampling field optimization
algorithms often include energy using classical treatment effects therefore tend
several groups combined sampling approaches
example through modeling environment conformational sampling obtained average prediction accuracy structures series
performance was further through sampling algorithm new energy model was applied even environments
alternative class methods determine structures all possible solutions set derived distance described work many other methods theory
particular introduced very approach known close different through
method been into protein design demonstrated its regions
more recently into problem finding real degree demonstrated various
review algorithms paper
more information several recent
computational modeling protein represented set points space
must set constraints derived structure
connectivity common require distance d between any pair i between certain bounds formula
interactions introduce additional constraints do systems
further constraints derived experimental techniques energy
taken together constraints reduce search space order identify
distance class methods aim specifically at constraints
error function measures constraints
methods involve four basic distance bounds random value each distance within bounds resulting distance matrix into set distance
generated original lower bounds usually using procedure
although process initial chosen may still higher prior error if random used
although methods generate rather most practical applications need further some form energy
since its first applications been applied wide range problems including structure conformational analysis modeling prediction
recently new technique known stochastic been developed alternative
random initial them individual at random towards specific
procedure performed obtained
method was developed reduction learning simple fast efficient applied molecular arbitrary complexity
because evaluation error function measures all possible distance bound every step method fast scales size
significantly more effective sampling full range conformational space compared other conformational search methods particularly when used conformational heuristic search towards more extended
furthermore input problem many search algorithms
proposed convergence into using those order
random initial algorithm
method able generate all constraints at time required
approach simple robust allows additional constraints
since constraints after process local
furthermore because each random initial each new independent those generated previous resulting greater more effective sampling
algorithm only involves distance relatively small efficient
paper present new algorithm been conformational sampling small molecules protein problem
provide detailed description algorithm its present comparative results set protein size been used previous studies
