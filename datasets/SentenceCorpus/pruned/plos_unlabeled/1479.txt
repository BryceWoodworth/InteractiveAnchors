introduction
humans via but few sources
potential effect environmental human health major
example been widely
humans used treatment
many affect multiple targets may affect same proteins environmental
mechanism action small molecules often not associated effects through example interactions
there thus need improve our understanding underlying mechanism action biological pathways they evaluate impact small molecules human health
essential step towards effect human health identify all possible molecular targets given
various approaches been recently identify novel protein using structural similarity
example et al applied network analysis their targets
authors identified molecular targets receptor receptor receptor
recent studies demonstrated could based upon their effect expression
et al showed genomic could used common mechanism action discovery unknown action
despite networks remains major issue human health
analysis environmental similar gene expression still
recent information activity response small more available
provide necessary data develop computational systems biology models predict both high level associations more detailed associations
paper present method disease identify potential molecular targets based integration data structures interaction data disease information functional
core our procedure derived target concept defined previously
but instead only binding activity extended concept gene expression
if two proteins affected two then both proteins space
our approach not only statistical model but true biological system network associations between human proteins defined network
our network comparison two high confidence interaction networks functional clusters network generated
revealed both known well many novel between proteins
provide literature support some associations between receptor target well between found
approach data other data types
