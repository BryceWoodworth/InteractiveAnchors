introduction
memory biological neural systems synaptic weights
computational models memory systems been order study their properties explore potential
optimal learning rules been studied both networks studied here networks
synaptic weights models represented continuous real numbers
however biology well potential synaptic weights should take values between certain bounds
furthermore might limited number synaptic states might binary
although binary might limited they made more robust biochemical noise than continuous
consistent experiments suggest synaptic weight changes occur
example single experiments show reduction current appropriate
networks property they new ones
contrast networks continuous additional quality recent
must case explicitly instance via weight mechanism
allows one study learning context there new information
common use memory neural networks
measures between responses higher more memory out less likely will
when weights each pattern same
then defined maximum number patterns larger than some fixed minimum value
however performance must characterized two initial its rate
memory high but learning rules typically results either increase memory but initial increase initial but memory
optimization learning rule because arbitrary must made between two effects
paper between learning terms information
describe framework information use find optimal learning rules
model single investigate how information depends number number synaptic states
find below critical number total linear number while more only number per
critical number dependent patterns well number synaptic states
furthermore when increasing number synaptic states information number states but many states
parameters just at critical point number per limited learning
finally measure allows direct comparison continuous under conditions their
