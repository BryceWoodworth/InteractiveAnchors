introduction
since early against been versus versus some highly
despite early alternative different high disease past very high well very low etc resulting over percent reduction developed
recent years after complete almost complete towards
increased perception perception disease previous
understanding predicting compare strategies achieve
highly dependent perceived risk disease
when disease risk low however small risk events become relatively important may lead lower than required control transmission
when disease risk too high other hand may increase above required population
behaviors two
after study
well below target level percent
despite confidence researchers most health confidence was affected
find ways confidence several studies were out identify factors associated their
they found not information health about were most common
other important factors lack belief information sources general
note during risk was very low due previously high
