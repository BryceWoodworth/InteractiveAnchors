function without lower reaction
here study mechanism through target recognition
two mechanisms were proposed
while both first step involves sequence events first complex target target
second target without
using dynamic obtained molecular dynamic simulations key both mechanisms
conformational states experimental observations occur without even though at reduced rate
furthermore propose mechanism
analysis conformational complex target binding binding populations
further binding key residues target recognition
introduction
protein function mechanisms one
binding target proteins key step cellular processes including cell cycle response
here focus one aim out mechanism through its target proteins
2 exist
change interaction patterns other proteins other events

at least different proteins been reported targets
mechanisms target proteins following sequential activation most cases
following activation form
next active single known pathway
then target protein
target increase reaction usually step
among targets i b without although reaction rates compared
essential conserved
where any amino
also during targets
addition target second contact thought higher compared other
domains sufficient activity
moreover also functional being core domain
activity its effect structural properties complex increasing complex specific protein targets rather than direct target interactions
structure complex idea
recent work also shows its target leading increase levels
due strong interactions between been question whether its activity whether only complex at complex
our aim understand mechanism through target recognition
out molecular dynamic simulations complex without
complex bound based structure
our results binding higher population target binding conformational space complex
binding between residues involved activity target recognition indeed target protein
our results further lead us propose mechanism through target recognition
below specific proteins rather than protein functional class they
were ones
