protein interactions play part function cell
experimental techniques detection protein interactions time there need computational methods task
protein interactions appear form network relatively high degree local clustering
paper clustering based observed protein interactions
both protein characteristics network properties
our based shown existing techniques predicting protein interactions them data sets high degree clustering
predicted interactions highly against test measures accuracy
compared similar derived interactions only higher sensitivity
at specific examples show how experimental set interactions
part work also examine effect different prior upon accuracy prediction find interactions same give better results than across there may fundamental differences between networks
results all network structure important accurate prediction protein interactions
protein interaction data set program used our analysis predictions available at
introduction
understanding complex within complete network protein interactions occur would significant step
experimentally protein interactions number techniques data available several database proteins information protein sequences
experimentally interactions show high negative high positive rates
paper develop new computational approach predict interactions experimental data
computational methods been developed
interaction use expression data proteins involved
prediction protein interactions contrast many methods been suggested
generate proteins functional relationship rather than physical interactions
terms physical interaction prediction available methods two approaches et al et al
et method domain interaction based approach protein interaction basis domain
if domain pair found observed protein interactions likely other protein pairs domain pair might also
observed protein interaction network probabilities interactions estimated
algorithm maximum likelihood estimates protein interactions occur each other
likelihood then used construct probability protein pair based estimated probabilities domain interactions within protein pair
et prediction based total interactions
however limited number known domains may well not describe variety protein interactions
approach had further domain interactions other biological information
et model et method multiple organisms
addition two other organisms
second type approach used et al
among protein interactions other organisms
if protein interaction exists many other organisms protein interaction will highly
addition suggest may provide even more information protein pairs
principle statistical clustering algorithms identify network could prediction method predicting all proteins within each other
focus statistical clustering approach rather than predicting individual interactions our
et method et method make use network structure interactions considered pairs
however pairs could should considered network where proteins nodes their interactions
networks revealed many properties including clustering tendency see also information
our method network structure patterns interactions rather than pairs
paper thus take idea characteristics protein will affect its interactions not yet idea its network position will also affect its interactions order develop novel predictive
our goal predict protein interactions type where both third protein therefore our approach particularly focus two simple three network structures
protein pair common
contrast protein pair common
will show network structures protein characteristics within them help predict protein interactions
apply our method interaction network database
during assume function structure known all proteins protein interaction network known all but one interaction
patterns predict interaction those protein pairs at least one common compare our results those three other
demonstrate proteins include proteins accuracy
prediction also compared networks where all proteins while network structure order examine whether specific network structure useful information protein interaction networks
measure true positive rate set protein pairs et al proposed expression measure true positive rate set protein pairs based biological
compare our our predictions achieve high true positive rate
also give examples experimental data predict new interactions
our predictive model uses prior interaction database use three prior protein interactions all interactions
results using different prior show use interactions within same rather than across significantly results interaction networks may significantly different between
comparing our method three other standard approaches approach et al et al approach et al find our method above approaches subset interactions yeast data set contains connectivity our analysis
our method methods et al et al their approaches apply rather different subset potential interactions yeast data set
