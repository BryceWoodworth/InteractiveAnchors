using large set almost produced tested algorithms human evaluation provided system
performance our best our human
our hypothesis were use larger number human evaluate any given could would perform classification at least average individual human
our analysis predicted accuracy involving term
introduction
information uses methods structure
way computational processing human
special case applications represented research classes between molecules cells structures
current tools information produce results
although even results useful highly most applications ability rank confidence quality their
focus about molecular interactions small protein b protein b gene c protein d small e
several studies examined aspects quality
example et al et al different confidence values different associated
et al proposed quality value each about molecular interactions although researchers did not suggested system practice
independent study used between biological terms given
our present analysis applied several techniques large training set examples design work human who output program
our goal design used any system developed molecular biology
study our training data thus our approach relationships specific system
relationships represented our results will prove useful other
our approach
first generated large training set were our system then correct human
second used tools work human
third training set into so could evaluate performance differences among several approaches
