finding functional dna binding sites transcription factors genome step understanding regulation
binding sites typically short significant statistical many more known motifs occur genome than actually functional
however information about structure may help identify functional sites
particular been shown active regulatory regions usually dna those regions
here describe novel discovery algorithm prior over dna sequence based view
when sampling algorithm applied yeast identified correct found percent more cases our prior than used prior
first information used improve discovery
even though using only statistical model predict our results improve further experimental data available
introduction
finding functional dna binding sites transcription factors genome necessary step understanding regulation
however despite binding data like gene expression finding functional binding sites remains difficult problem because binding sites most short sequences occur genome
particular known motifs genome often do not appear bound
one popular when dna form not all dna
state dna
along dna provide mechanism at potential binding sites
indeed been shown functional binding sites at regulatory regions typically
if genome under various conditions could increase search functional binding sites
here describe method information into discovery algorithms
our method should improve discovery most when data under various conditions
data not available any at scale let under variety conditions
because our method probabilistic even evidence
example et al recently computational model based experimental binding data predicts probability each position yeast genome being bound predictions intrinsic dna sequence thus independent condition but were explain observed
addition et al used average each yeast region
show whether learned computational predictions average data significantly not only used prior but also discovery
