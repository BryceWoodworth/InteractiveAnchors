our study evolutionary models intrinsic factors should used models analyze effect selection evolution
introduction
genetic basis evolution one fundamental problems biology
selection would influence probabilities mutations affect mutations fixed during evolution would determine genomes genetic systems underlying
however because genetic systems would effects mutations properties genetic system would influence rates evolution well robustness
therefore both genetic systems each other
gene regulatory networks important genetic systems involved various biological processes environmental responses organisms cell organisms
recent theoretical experimental studies revealed complex gene changes regulatory interactions particularly gene
addition recent studies structural features complex distributions distributions features genetic characteristics robustness
one important question evolution complex evolutionary structural properties
various evolutionary processes influence evolution properties
thus difficult identify factors evolution properties could result being directly selection also result other factors
thus identify factors evolution properties complex necessary consider not only selection but also various processes processes
selection one most important evolution
however impact selection evolution
selection strongly mutations mutations fixed during evolution
thus important examine how different selection would affect evolution
however there significant our general understanding processes adaptation evolutionary biology
many previous studies evolution robustness respect focused mutations under selection constant optimal environment
other hand mutations adaptation under environments limited
many studies suggested some examples related robustness
theoretical studies proposed genetic properties appear genetic properties could play significant role evolution
however how robustness process evolution
certain properties might through processes mutations constraints gene regulation
mutations particular source genetic variation
thus properties mutations potentially influence tendency
example probability transcription factor binding site formation result mutations could several variation size potential regions among organisms rate gene could several times higher than rate gene certain organisms
moreover been suggested regulatory genes observed extent than genes
several studies suggested certain features complex degree distributions could outcome mutations
however previous studies not considered certain essential evolutionary processes selection gene
therefore whether features complex result selection result properties mutations
study was identify evolutionary various structural properties complex distributions robustness
model gene expression levels allows populations under various conditions selection various mutations gene mutation gene
study explore conditions evolution complex first examine evolution under various conditions selection
second adaptive mechanisms evolution complex examine effect all mutations during evolution
third explore whether factors organisms evolution examined impact gene expression cost constraints expression dynamics several types biases relative rates gene formation new transcription factor binding sites gene
finally basis results above analyses discuss major evolutionary various properties complex distributions distributions robustness
