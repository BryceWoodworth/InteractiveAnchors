introduction
inference molecular sequences popular patterns
usually provides time mutations their genomes
spatial among other processes gene sequences
both evolutionary history spatial process sequences provides fundamental understanding evolutionary dynamics underlying
also effective strategies key factors transmission gene over larger central strategies
analyses common approach molecular processes evolution spatial distributions scale over years
many popular approaches interaction between evolutionary processes domains
one first spatial information then conditions tests evaluate structure
about between however require patterns process evolutionary history
states problem state inference
popular heuristic approach single tree
important sources model uncertainty including both uncertainty process well unknown
addition number state over when rates evolution when state probabilities
probabilistic methods model state evolution ability complete state history over statistical
analyses typically markov models state evolution common amino models
contrast maximum length differences probability each state given observed states at
bayesian methods further generalization probability analysis markov model parameters obtain states fixed tree known
bayesian inference over all possible parameter values but achieve however requires prior probability distributions all aspects model
while probabilistic methods been previously presented context particular bayesian methods over uncertainty markov model parameter uncertainty studies made use
may low existing arbitrary markov models lack uncertainty intrinsic one through probabilistic approaches
recent study heuristic test evaluate whether events between two particular occur at significantly high frequency
distributions after discovery rate control testing
although procedure about statistical inference sparse frequency matrices multiple comparison still results estimate significant events
probabilistic approaches may further statistical inference yet similar tests models
evolutionary inference demonstrated how novel approaches sequence analyses many cases alignment parameter estimation tree
example inference involved time scale evolutionary history theory impact tree
well sequential important sources uncertainty because they generally error associated each estimate
novel computational techniques like markov sampling become many models involved estimate parameters interest
inference example population
bayesian methods also state while both uncertainty
although much needed analysis would even more spatial temporal inference
here states bayesian statistical framework evolutionary hypothesis testing towards
allows natural time scales under molecular combination several models population size change
use full probabilistic approach study bayesian mixture model rates markov model some probability
bayesian stochastic search variable selection us construct factor test most description process
also demonstrate how distribution sampling prior
