recently evolution biology form theory variation
key observation organisms designed random genetic changes potentially useful
open question how during evolution
here address means computer simulations two model systems rna secondary structure
find evolution environments change time time environments made same set but different
find organisms under not only their history but also future environments high novel
adaptation seen same novel where one was seen history
mechanisms way organisms information their genomes about their past environments
elements variation theory regulatory reduced mutations under conditions
thus environments change variation allow evolution novel conditions
introduction
ability generate one main evolution
evolutionary theory including suggested how useful might physiological robustness process
early theories were limited lack knowledge molecular mechanisms development
recent understanding molecular biology
many findings were theory variation presented following how small random genetic changes into complex useful
order understand evolution observations molecular mechanisms show how current design determine nature degree future variation
key observation its intrinsic biases both type amount its variation response random genetic mutation
other words seems way small genetic mutations high large payoff
understand important compare related concept
biological system if novel functions through genetic changes help future environments
two generate new new future environments
most studies focused first
studies measured range variation generated given mutation usually without between potentially useful ones
theory previous nature generated variation specifically ability generate novel potentially useful
variation made possible certain features biological design
one existence regulatory where general signals large responses
example changes growth concentration at position large useful changes conserved mechanisms growth
good example any many possible mutations affect concentration single factor
regulatory information about output into system without only between states
regulatory constraints new complex potentially useful
additional feature important design seen example highly conserved gene regulation signaling networks
mutation might many different
designed variation within each generated without other
variation principle studied experimentally example types generated
example study regulatory region gene input function functions rather than other
open question how does
not clear how selection present environment lead increase probability useful changes future environments
how does evolutionary theory account special make generate novel useful variation
key point our study observation environments nature do not but rather common rules
specifically environmental organisms molecules may thought combination
when environments change organisms new goal still made same similar
example level same must each new environment but different
level cells same signaling must each type but different input output signals
level proteins same activity binding other proteins regulatory input domains etc many proteins but different each case
one may thus propose many cases different possible environments sense they all made certain set
thus test under environments learn over many common environments its past
whether environments ability simple model systems new previously same past
two model rna secondary structure
find standard experiment setting goal remains constant over time leads highly systems show little
contrast generated under change over time but same
find evolution ability generate novel long novel novel
show organisms under information about past their genomes allows small genetic changes large responses do not structure
our study thus suggests environments change evolution variation properties organisms them new conditions same past conditions
