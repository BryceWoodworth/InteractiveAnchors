approaches dynamics their while under neural control focused questions stability humans
prior studies focused how central system generate motion
however question whether properties particularly context tasks remains open
through pair against common may produce significantly more power than when matching conditions between
since further will occur at greater than natural frequency
were optimal control methods model also through measurements pairs upon
find increase power when compared at frequency higher than natural frequency
observed behaviors context notion matching

introduction
power key performance organisms
how fast how far limited power environmental
therefore been interest
many factors influence performance organisms including dynamics properties neural control influence
approaches been proposed interaction all factors
example between neural control been studied respect dynamic stability functions other tasks
work dynamic relation between
relation between only
context most focused experimentally power output individual at range parameters finding power under motion
however role interaction output not been
central work system cannot determined manner without properties dynamics neural activation
explicitly at cannot using standard testing including interaction manner
been characterized under dynamic conditions both
measurements almost technique
approach length time means motion source
at given phase stimulus resulting
versus results area within being measure work
similar measurements been literature various groups within various organisms between function its been made
while measurements provide useful function experimental conditions do not conditions because motion single no interactions without effects activity
measurements other hand all above effects principle but lack experimental conditions manner
effect interaction critical
interaction relation
when group common pair common each part other its group
because activation dependent neural control used effective observed each conditions power environmental
notion matching systems where source provide optimal power
context control matching groups work provide significantly higher than individual
studied influence interaction both experimentally
set up model problem system either single pair
input system two well
context problem investigated two hypothesis
hypothesis 1 states power optimal frequency system greater than frequency
direct contrast where optimal frequency occurs at
hypothesis 2 states pair work together produce more power than cannot predicted without
tested both experimentally
our computational approach optimal control solutions maximization problem was based mathematical model problem
experimental approach measurements against
