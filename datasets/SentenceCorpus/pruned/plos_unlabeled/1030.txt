introduction
part several fundamental biological processes including protein response cellular
process also associated development variety including
best characterized occurs human protein
at structural level features while made several
structure complex
although structure studies shown percent solution
rather significant population could not only but also different conditions along different two experiments
free energy further support hypothesis significant population
thus population likely increase where percent complex solution
measurements show free energy solution
free energy based either classical long point similar
addition they suggest between well interactions between transition state
consistent associated position
studies along further suggested several residues activity
free energy characterized network protein associated its active site network
process key need
studies suggested overall process involves solution complex protein
however studies so far consider
most current proposed mechanism cannot explain molecular biology data
studies show residues not involved proposed mechanisms important function their mutations indeed 1 s 1 type 1 s 1 conserved
although mutation was proposed was out computational so far no functional role been
addition mutation along although residues not involved
here use molecular simulations address
free energy associated long complex
free energy function two reaction been suggested describe best process well other pairs different our results
use here been predict interactions
potential used effective one
choice allows very efficient sampling because its relatively small computational cost
its field expected relatively accurate describe key our problem
accuracy field transition states comparing our results first principle
based comparison find biases whereas their influence more significant
therefore here free energy differences between used predict relative populations only compared at level most likely
out populations one specific relative ones instead far most stable solution
addition free energy specific one way
findings allow us propose hypothesis process consistent all available experimental data
