regulatory complexity increase number parameters required experimental data number protein interactions increases
therefore biochemical models
here propose framework intrinsic protein structure address regulatory complexity
rather than proteins model their structure conformational changes dynamics
regulation proteins through conformational changes often number parameters required data so reduce improve predictive power model
our method detailed also molecular activity
use our network examine how how change observed protein
also develop model g functional predict rank order through receptor
our should provide basis biochemical networks systems biology
introduction
goal biology understand structure function biochemical networks cellular decision-making
one principle networks specific functions subset proteins network
yet like even individual proteins perform multiple
approach analysis system scales well size system its complexity
indeed design systems other
if molecular biology structures larger
networks may role protein domains
their function often depends interaction at one site structure at site via conformational change
indeed increases ability network because proteins dynamic computational elements
approach analysis design biochemical networks should therefore explicitly describe performed individual proteins
complexity biochemical networks should also protein structure
protein structure given protein often domains also present other proteins
example many proteins contain domains many
genetic networks transcription factors also often common domain
protein domains both domain been characterized used but also necessary model molecular between pathways contain proteins similar structures
protein interactions generate both regulatory complexity
complexity number possible species system number proteins interactions system increases
because number states increases its proteins well each other different residues
example cellular known sites so potentially 2 states
thus complete description system potentially requires large number distinct species reactions
contrast regulatory complexity increase number parameters required describe regulatory interactions within system number interactions increase
complexity because protein interactions depends state each state potentially requires unique set parameters interactions within other network molecules network
number parameters
complexity allows regulatory system
examples include
rather than explicitly each species reaction network model system according set rules
each rule reaction all relevant biochemical parameters
thus complex systems described because large number distinct reactions single rule
algorithm may complete reaction network prior simulation if complexity too use alternative techniques system
some rules also conditions when interaction occur hence regulatory network
example rule may allow only kinase its
describe complex biochemical systems but little number problems
first using rules regulatory system does not address regulatory complexity
consider g site g site
binding multiple targets
given one different one g different g proteins then principle require parameters describe how each each g protein
thus number regulatory parameters scales number rules also scales because each parameter part rule distinct constraints
proteins therefore require large number rules parameters their interactions
second should function between systems but most not
typically proteins define interactions using biochemical
approaches regulation proteins rules conditions no apply when proteins different
rules mechanism underlying regulation because they do not show explicitly how intrinsic structural properties proteins generate their functional properties
contrast approach would regulatory proteins themselves
changes rules would then required define how new set interaction activity
if model protein domains components would also
finally models generated methods should correct
biochemical networks there often sets reactions into cycle
many no free energy example when proteins multiple when several protein when multiple open states
mathematical relationship between all reactions involved their must
cannot therefore
correct should model
here present regulatory well complexity biochemical networks
first describe our framework uses treatment only conformational state proteins
also introduce our network
use examine how make more
then show how our framework common mechanisms regulatory properties protein conformational changes protein itself demonstrate how analysis multiple through protein
next discuss how our approach regulatory complexity increases
finally use our framework develop model g whose regulatory complexity scales instead greater predictive power
while our major goal introduce new rather than its made models discuss available
