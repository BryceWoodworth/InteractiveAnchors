previous analysis metabolic network suggested existence several pathways
here identified sets pathways into
pathways two other pathways were studied using those pathways evaluation predictive model
growth were studied under different conditions
comparison model predictions resulting experimental only activity able into
however results modeling showed two activation pathways present not only active but needed due additional role cycle adaptation
other cases data suggested additional constraints were biochemical
results demonstrate need experimentally activity key when models based metabolic networks
introduction
species interest because their natural role their ability their
most investigated species because genetic system complete genome sequence whole genome available
furthermore functional studies provided into mechanisms important
g
use either reduction also used
understanding species required because organisms because recent studies shown addition species
previous studies demonstrated species related via cycle
however many other aspects central general still
better understand g metabolic model was used investigate unique associated reduction
model impact global during reduction energy predicted lower observed during growth had been
furthermore network revealed existence number pathways central g
recent genetic studies shown presence metabolic pathways well metabolic networks genetic
experimental evidence optimal pathways been observed e where four metabolic gene had significantly different metabolic distributions but similar overall growth rates
hence role pathways using models provide key into properties metabolic networks
here report computational experimental evaluation potential pathways during g
demonstrate need pathways due between cycle activation also some predicted alternatives
also show using information model its predictive
