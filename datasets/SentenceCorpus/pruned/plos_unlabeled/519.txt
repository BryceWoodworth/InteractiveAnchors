patterns activity necessary development visual
patterns primary visual many develop properties similar those but without training visual experience
previous models demonstrated how responses through mechanisms specific development prior visual experience using cues simple activity additional constraints
argue patterns may better part learning strategy activity both before during visual experience
activity models show how visual system may able efficient its natural environment prior visual experience same strategy upon natural experience
patterns generated through simple local interactions contain same relevant statistical properties
efficient patterns sparse natural neurons structure same found early visual cells
address statistical properties activity how system may activity prior during natural experience how efficient our natural world
introduction
nature learned literature early visual development
variety studies shown visual system requires experience
other hand many able see at primary visual even before
might properties found at properties dependent visual experience learned
however may limit our understanding visual development
particular focus issue form learning occurs before patterns activity generated
well known activity necessary development visual system
point paper discuss statistical aspects activity may sufficient development much same way visual experience visual system
propose learning approach system later between nature
several studies shown early visual development neurons active correlated their patterns activity
later patterns were many one example shown
experiments since then them them their properties shown how they necessary development
several models been proposed
two most recent models cells activity general about mechanism
neurons while cells if cells local area also
rules formation models formation been able complex those
although activity been well studied many exhibit neural activity
visual system both activity during development
effects connectivity been formation
activity also known occur system necessary development
similar mechanisms also found
perspective been shown neural activity necessary many effects synaptic
activity development its ability affect various aspects neural connectivity understanding general role activity early visual development likely
primary visual been known cells strongly later experiments simple cells description much like function shown
cell specific visual space where relatively visual image will cell
note what instead why
according efficient hypothesis role early visual system statistical visual
hypothesis one way understand visual system develop analyze visual natural
was using sparse independent components analysis set natural etc
derived found simple cells see
one results developed visual world
paper make there computational existence patterns functional strategy early visual system development both prior experience
addition molecular cues visual training patterns activity during development similar manner how visual statistical patterns found natural
many statistical structure models rely between assumption other functional activity
however many efficient models applied natural sparse rely statistics
fact often first step process known process at least part considered function cells
although activity patterns known relevant argue field may also rely statistics thus between models sparse efficient activity
will demonstrate simple patterns activity used training visual
patterns use only activity available demonstrated 1 specific examples our generated patterns
visual our pattern technique also general properties parameters current models
strongly note however not model but what essential features relevant activity
more paper statistical nature produced activity than its including whether activity one particular area part larger system
example comparison activity more direct influence field formation
remains active at activation while activity do not significantly time
activity been experimentally characterized but far less than activity thus our paper
our patterns generated using site models its relation physiological models detailed section
models common study critical models model been used neural networks understanding neurons useful understanding models development
models example been neural networks since network
recent work also shown models entropy neural firing upon natural
although pattern technique use similar networks been shown relevant demonstrate statistical properties
main goal paper show how same adaptive efficient algorithm applied both natural well activity
show certain patterns relevant statistics network provides useful property
patterns independent how they were generated simply used existence possible training role activity
first will show our generated patterns known patterns activity
will then compare various methods learning how both natural activity patterns used produce
will also demonstrate how significant field properties occur even at threshold scale learning even model
finally one main points paper expressed relevant statistics simple
there statistics still present after
sparse independent efficient algorithms rely statistics found natural also present particular structure activity patterns
will present how fact points same adaptive strategy may then present both before during visual experience
