during development information provided concentration factors pattern formation dependent cues gene expression
example activation gene at response local
regulatory region contains multiple binding sites protein well multiple binding sites protein
some previous studies suggested sufficient expression yet other evidence suggests need additional regulation
experimentally dynamics gene expression were were binding construct two sites
addition experiments developed reaction model transcription binding used analysis multiple states reaction network
our model dynamics predicts patterns
analysis our model produced spatial two stable levels expression
behavior
binding position where occurs but not itself sufficient pattern
our results show control processes
our model changes position observed different experiments provides theoretical framework understanding data particular spatial play central role mechanisms information
introduction
how pattern form state people at least since time
over example experiments proposed system cellular experiments who showed secondary when into body another
other results were into information
according concept spatial concentration signals provide information during cellular each cell its position local concentration
concept become central biology
molecular techniques demonstrated cases protein concentration patterns many been shown
protein was characterized its effect target genes was demonstrated
since become one most studied examples signaling biology
models been applied describe variety systems biology
along many mathematical tools been developed support applications
tools one show certain reaction networks may exhibit multiple states particular their rate
special case system either two stable states
under certain conditions spatial
biology long been control cell cycle other also recently reported gene regulation network
spatial been proposed
early protein at end concentration
through its distribution at genes will
combination between genes initial first
still not well characterized however what mechanisms information into target gene expression
one first genes strong expression at
activation depends shown et al et al its own reported et al et al many binding sites been identified region reported et al among others
provides information other genes gene
both expression results most
normal development expression over about percent length attention been focused what molecular mechanism
early was shown base pairs binding sites sufficient regulatory activity
was shown sites was due small change concentration across some threshold could produce large change expression pattern
however studies did not sufficient generate
degree et al used site i found about et al using found
patterns proteins et al estimated higher value suggested could support expression determined binding
however systems high would expected show sensitivity
et al showed strongly affected changes c but pattern
between would expected show far greater effects than observed cannot only factor
produce also findings et al who showed between necessary expression patterns genes including itself
address taken combined experimental theoretical approach understand how gene information into expression pattern
used experimentally determine how position change measured how affected binding use 2 binding sites
also developed predictive reaction model transcription both binding
model patterns determined parameters model binding
parameters our model dynamic development pattern
binding number binding sites our model same our experiments predicts loss experimentally
systems theory model show due spatial
means does not single concentration dependent but at threshold concentration two stable states become available small change concentration concentration
between states
position threshold binding but mechanism itself not sufficient generate expression
