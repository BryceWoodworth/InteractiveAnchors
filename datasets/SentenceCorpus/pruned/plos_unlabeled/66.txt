data being generated effort represent brain expression all genes at cellular
critical effort ability place data into common reference
here developed computational method gene expression patterns context type data
procedure been applied genes brain
utility identify genes may related disease using expression search pattern
addition transcription factor relative control quantitative comparison expression patterns
method developed here complex data
introduction
gene expression provide important information about how genes biological processes at cellular molecular levels
therefore gene expression at single cell
common they generate numbers expression patterns presence proteins particular cell group cells within natural context
however large limited per without efficient means compare gene protein expression patterns
genomic sequence information expression patterns requires
mean sites expression representation
approach taken gene expression database gene expression patterns using terms
provides relationships using tree
terms model
also provides tools directly into
although hand effective method not efficient means datasets
addition if future changes made may require review previously data
here present novel approach uses modeling technique brain
then major structures present brain define between structures provide representation small structures
when technique method gene expression one large number gene expression patterns way allows expression patterns regions interest
brain was selected because at many complex brain functions yet existing information underlying molecular mechanisms still relatively limited
describe here generated using application our method
then demonstrate utility approach two genes expressed genes potentially involved functional
