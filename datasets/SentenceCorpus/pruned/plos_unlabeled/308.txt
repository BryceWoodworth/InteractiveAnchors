activity states observed several after stimulus basis memory
one possible mechanisms activity synaptic
recent experimental study revealed between cells exhibit various synaptic
here analyze effect synaptic dynamics states neural networks
show different synaptic result different network dynamics respect states
analysis framework neural networks extended represent stimuli
introduction
memory us stimulus few after thus information over time
neurons memory tasks activity after stimulus
activity states considered memory
activity either during learning task
studies revealed effects
effect synaptic expressed synaptic following firing
several theoretical studies investigated effects synaptic existence stability states
et al recently performed experiments investigate synaptic one where activity observed
they found area exhibit various synaptic three different classes identified
while synaptic was recently factor network there yet no study its effect dynamics neural networks transition states after stimulus
consider neural network been learning several stimuli
assume network set populations each certain stimulus
via learning synaptic within population form stable activity state
recent experimental results assume neurons within each population differ dynamic properties their thus exhibit different temporal response same stimuli
firing then lead further synaptic within population neurons similar synaptic dynamics more strongly one another than ones synaptic dynamics
thus consider network several populations each into different synaptic dynamics
populations via both dynamic generate dynamics response stimuli
since synaptic dynamics differ between them different temporal input could result greater computational power network
