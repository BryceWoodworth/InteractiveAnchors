introduction
social network effects importance understanding human behavior
people number individuals some individuals more than others behavior fundamental ways
long studied social influence through networks networks now appear other including health
social networks analysis including their structure their effect social dynamics include
networks also long been known important many biology including evolution
social networks also been studied health patterns disease behavior online health
studies suggest physical environment social environment also important health
they lead health must designed work network structure network health related information
within network studies much work focused how information behaviors other between individuals social networks
processes generally
dynamics possible network structure examined using mathematical models processes
then used obtain accurate measures expected information
many previous models been proposed study interactions between individuals
most considered populations although more recent work focused populations
most well studied models including populations
various related processes been used model social influence important including same models models statistical type interactions threshold models
each models however one more properties social
many do not probabilistic nature disease
others only consider populations where effect network structure
most models not directly social other phenomenon because many social may also
possible behavior obtain information source without directly contact network
other words probability each contact there also probability independent local network
not disease models
models based early work do take into account
individuals state new idea both social factors
however models do not allow because assumed changes behavior individuals state
results population at
does not dynamics many may
through multiple states individuals
finally most previous models make assumptions about type interaction between individuals not usually real data
yet long term behavior model strategies suggests depend interaction assumptions
here introduce new model study social network all important properties above
then analyze its characteristics show how applied different
model classical disease model features other models above
both through social transmission allows
example focus study network
interaction assumptions model will using network transmission data
show how values rate versus determine extent social transmission important
use predict
results model very different models other interaction assumptions rules models
will show components often small compared component but may still levels
will use generate results populations well simulations using real social network
