knowledge social contact patterns still most critical step understanding directly
data social contact patterns however obtain
major issue then whether simulation might data
paper variety contact matrices through simulation simple model
model time use data data
model little because each agent real person
other words each one observed corresponding real individual time use
also generated contact matrices model underlying prediction
matrices then against recently data
their performance compared other matrices available matrix
matrices show same features ones estimated sample example strong presence related between
against data little matrices than one but better than matrices
first where contact matrices compared real ones against data
results suggest simple designed matrices provide approach matrices
paper also idea depending level either number different may key factor transmission
introduction
after first mathematical after years fast growth since first health modeling recently further
first potentially then finally recent all development more more detailed predictive tools
range models network analysis highly detailed large scale models
highly tools policy they allow define measures at possible levels
first time model scale been proposed
critical common all models social contact patterns how people each other
social contact patterns key factors underlying transmission dynamics directly
different models their level complexity scale social contact patterns
relatively simple case where individuals only contact patterns represented form contact matrices whose represent average number individuals group i individuals group per time
recently contact patterns were estimated contact matrices using observed data case data
two major examples approach matrix approach
approaches important population n groups contact matrix contains n 2 unknown
therefore order estimate n 2 parameters n data points some assumptions about structure matrix needed
addition approaches only estimate transmission rates parameters given between contact rate corresponding risk per contact
recently important been made area through direct contact data means sample
direct approach based appropriate at risk event
then asked relevant characteristics all individuals they had contact during other factors where contact
data social contact patterns available
addition contact matrices time contact matrices been estimated secondary data sources time use data available
case time use data underlying hypothesis amount time people same activity same place relevant transmission disease
time use data they usually do not give direct information about number social time they
they only give information time individuals various
therefore data need other data assumptions produce estimates contact matrices
way time use data sources provide information size distribution where take place
example often know average class size average all
within information size
most other however there little information
assumptions therefore necessary give some contact patterns
however approach structure social networks where
approach then networks simulation appropriate social networks
first example social network generated population
case contact time contact matrices social dynamics model
matrices standard expected population most other close their own etc however matrices were compared other contact matrices against empirical data
thus no actual evaluation their transmission available
paper same aim contact matrices model
model time use data time use other data
model each agent real individual there between each agent one corresponding real
since sample population but size model population small model little
point view our model model model
little world agents during order their various corresponding
agents contact other agents
defined contact having same physical environment during given time
our approach generate three different types contact matrices distinct aspects biology matrix time contact matrix number contact matrix average number different number different social
addition contact matrix model underlying prediction
contact matrices simulation little tested against recently data
their compared other contact matrices available time use matrices
