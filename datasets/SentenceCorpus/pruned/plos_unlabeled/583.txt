suggest finding between fact treatment although itself most strongly rather than outcomes predictions
introduction
play critical role conditions including
however despite importance normal function still
three particular findings
first involved prediction events form
second involved behavioral actions predictions outcomes
third finding data models together fact human subjects who at times subjective disease various scales
furthermore while used treatment risk factor
findings second fact seems first third themselves
if involved predicting outcomes then should positive rather than negative
suggest interactions between predictions action selection
interaction seen standard test predictions
actions
during performance rate at those responses
theoretical interaction though there some evidence its
here subset processes associated behavioral system terms what might called response
responses reactions presence significant outcomes
responses responses predictions those outcomes
even though predictions learned responses not may therefore certain
our long most important response prediction form
explicitly first two findings discussed above directly associated predictions
explore direct action learning settings together when highly model effects more general learning effects
more specifically model
our treatment considered actions lead one belief state next
thought value through their group states were either positive negative values
directly thought predicted lead negative states
our model seen terms decision tree outcome states choices
argue results above now when behavioral learning about world action choice predictions
most effect model critical bias
states actions potentially negative because
when though three above there two
first no action choice so subjects learn potentially situations rather than being able rely mechanism
second due between policy value function between predicted actual values actual values being more negative than predicted though also actually more
between policy value function also leads overall reduction rewards obtained
