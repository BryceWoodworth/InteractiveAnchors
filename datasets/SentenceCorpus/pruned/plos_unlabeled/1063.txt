binding domain domain long domain
using molecular dynamics normal analysis suggest domain regions under yet highly region within each interactions between strong between its two
natural domain molecular dynamics simulations also predict domain possible
introduce computational methods molecules using constraints
molecular dynamics also performed across associated domain
introduction
networks stability cell
dynamic requires molecules
three major structural binding domain domain central domain
each contains all three structural domains but two so two at
two at allows
very relationship each other molecules
several cellular processes involving dynamic formation membrane bound molecules formation cells
order its function dynamic environment must must stable at some regions at other regions binding dynamic environment
structure domain function
each central domain long made up
other molecules include
domain other family molecules its length its more its
structure domain several characteristics residues within each secondary structure basic strong interactions between interaction residues between both interactions produce degree degree
together characteristics account domain both structural
goal understand structural mechanisms domain
nature domain essential component domain structure
proteins
most residues every
allows one region into other mechanism
presence residues common structure but necessary sufficient
like domain interactions between within
general mechanism exists only when interactions
tendency interactions play key role like contrast proteins where interactions significant molecular stability
domain significant structural feature interactions structure stability suggests significant role interactions properties domain
several studies examined properties other molecules
studies dna together suggest like structure
structure dna more because two
contrast other proteins due their structures
difference between dna protein significant but properties still compared
dna most studied been described
its global behavior been described like but its local behavior been described like
region functions
using single total experiment been shown region significant underlying its function
first structure major its behavior molecular dynamics shown strong over 1 needed percent
interactions underlying significantly its
studies suggest but
studies other molecules demonstrated domain
experimental using demonstrated mechanism
several molecular dynamics further domain resulting between within each
there been no domain other but structure using shown there must some structural since molecules form stable range
due domain
what features structure its
using molecular dynamics normal analysis study domain
simulations demonstrate other molecules domain
normal analysis shows structure towards its
our simulations suggest interactions determine domain interaction between domain
