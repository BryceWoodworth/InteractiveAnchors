however since most mutations one should how mutations new functions relative all other mutations
applied g analyze effects mutations evolution different
stability effects type mutations were compared g changes all possible point mutations same
found mutations functions almost average mutation
although their stability effects not key residues mutations binding thus new place larger stability than mutations evolutionary changes
how effects functional mutations adaptation
our analysis also many mutations appear evolution no role new function effects may effects mutations
thus evolution new both nature dependent effect mutations regions protein its function
introduction
protein domains structure function dependent its stability
evolutionary processes they adaptive involve mutations may affect protein function stability
example mutation new function but stability will not become fixed
relationship between effects function stability therefore our understanding not only evolutionary dynamics proteins but also novel
particularly structural residues active sites
point view overall protein stability active site number
functional residues generally like
key residues often
key increase stability activity
observations generally principle was later extended between new functions stability
however discussed below there exists fundamental difference between mutations key residues well mutations evolutionary new functions
new functions via mutations typically increasing rates
changes involve active site its even second third residues while key residues
shown below mutations key residues typically involve into within type new function mutations far more
observed et al most mutations new functions been
however new functions should view fact their function most mutations
indeed g distributions all possible mutations series proteins using experimentally algorithm about percent mutations percent significantly
other hand mutations changes occur at first sequence mutations much less average g
thus better understanding how new functions protein stability requires comparison mutations new protein functions all other possible mutations protein well mutations changes
investigated large set mutations were found new evolution experiments
applied g values mutations compared type g values mutations all possible point mutations same proteins
while values prediction limited accuracy they do distributions g values large set proteins mutations whole predictions show correlation experimental data
thus values individual mutations experimental values observed likely relevant
