paper investigate optimal drug at least delay
design analyze stochastic mathematical model evolutionary dynamics cell population during
consider drug due single genetic probability during specific strategies
then treatment risk while drug effects constraints

introduction
normal regulation at processes
detailed molecular understanding processes provides design agents
term focused mechanism specifically protein targets biological pathways when cancer cells
examples type include pathway agents like
approach drug development more empirical approach used develop past few years power concept
responses many cases however importance basic studies into mechanisms their
drug important
due drug drug drug target mutation
depending cancer type its genetic one several genetic may necessary drug cells
paper investigate drug due single
example treatment agent due point mutations kinase domain
different point mutations been identified each sufficient
most mutations mutation however all kinase developed so far
point mutation growth factor receptor kinase used cell cancer
other mechanisms include gene family membrane drug changes cellular proteins involved activation drug changes molecules involved dna activation well genes like
design optimal drug risk important issue cancer research
many at low so no drug necessary limit effects
drug may at higher short allow
studies different approaches been
some found continuous strategy more effective while others more
continuous approach often its effect cells rather than low rates
continuous strategy often combination including second drug at higher
significant amount research effort been mathematical models growth response
paper proposed model specific growth
authors used model rate cell was rate growth given size
they suggested one way rate regression was increase treatment smaller thus increasing
authors also review trials related their proposed strategy concept was
later predictions model were effects strategy
their model its predictions become known hypothesis generated interest mathematical modeling
example model describe cell cycle model was then used treatment increase degree thus drug
introduced another model dynamics cells investigate effect drug model was then used while
other theoretical studies include mathematical model during control approach optimal strategies evaluation strategies their effects
more models response
there also been research mathematical models genetic genetic cancer cells
since mutations random events during dna phase cell dynamics populations description stochastic mathematical models
field stochastic models against treatment
studied one two using process model growth
model rates cells were each cell cell certain probability
effect drug was additional probabilistic cell existing population drug could fixed at series fixed time points
goal model was sequential both order probability
later assumption between two was
models were also extended include effects normal optimal control problem was probability without
more recently used process model study probability due one multiple mutations populations under selection
authors considered mutations determined strategy multiple
was also investigated using process model work
their models each drug was genetic within network
rates each cell type were cells had additional rate if they were one more
authors studied evolution cells both before after treatment probability treatment under continuous treatment scenarios variable number
recently dynamics due one two genetic population cells prior were studied using process
one common feature models genetic treatment effect additional probabilistic cell rate cells underlying process model constant rates
under model assumptions drug cannot rate either however main effect many cancer cells
turn leads reduced probability since cells generated during cell
paper process model rates both cells dependent drug concentration
study significant existing models since effect cell well more accurate description evolutionary dynamics system
addition our model so drug may also effect rates cells
our analysis also differ those previous work
were finding optimal strategy multiple combination sequential they probability while
was effect multiple probability
contrast paper derive estimates expected size cell population well probability during full continuous treatment one drug
then propose optimal strategy probability well delay disease expected size population while constraints
many scenarios probability high strategy thus delay disease more objective than
developed paper applied study any cancer treatment type
