literature source knowledge associations between genes cellular processes
used method relationships between literature
its use knowledge method also new hidden relationships between following simple c no direct relationship but via
paper describe discovery literature new relationships between
statistical analysis using showed discovery performed well over wide range settings
used discovery search new relationships between genes pathways
several found relationships were using independent literature sources
addition new predicted relationships between cell were experimentally cell
results show discovery able identify novel associations between genes pathways high probability being
makes discovery useful mechanisms disease find novel drug targets find novel applications existing
introduction
knowledge function genes their role biological processes present literature full database
various approaches been developed information gene function body literature been applied genes proteins experimental results
common method relationships between genes pathways
method assumption same body some way related
methods also used new hidden relationships if c both b c might also relationship even if there no relationship between c provided example his study found patients disease finding was experimentally few years later
hidden literature relationships used hypothesis about relationship between c so called discovery process
process provides hypothesis related c then tested literature support hypothesis
hidden relationships also used generate novel about relationship between c open discovery process
process provides point literature hidden relationships other c
tools available open discovery experiments often limited certain domains only limited number terms hidden relationships less
moreover all open discovery tools identify true hidden relationships
previous paper described database
database statistical all makes possible perform statistical analyses hidden relationships between
addition contains several genes etc database use discovery hidden relationships
paper describe discovery method uses database open discovery hidden literature relationships
statistical analysis results using show discovery true hidden relationships true
application method open hidden novel about process relationships were
moreover used discovery identify two novel would cell
experimental showed
