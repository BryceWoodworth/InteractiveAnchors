introduction
rna not only genetic information dna protein but also critical structural components cell
more been found play important regulatory
they gene expression two one target their expression other form structural gene expression transcription
regulatory make them drug targets efficient tools drug development gene
past few years many rna structural motifs been identified
they often regions sense factors including proteins small even changes transcription stability
functions regulatory their secondary structures
moreover regulatory often conserved during similar regulatory rna elements multiple genes same metabolic pathway conserved genes across related species
experimental highly time
demonstrated previous studies way find good experimental
because functional regulatory often conserved their secondary structures identify them finding significantly conserved rna secondary structures genes across related species
need two one predict common rna secondary structures multiple related sequences other functional rna secondary structures random rna sequences
number algorithms been developed common rna secondary structure prediction
recently new algorithm called rna predicting common rna secondary structures structural multiple sequences
both our study independent studies other researchers demonstrated rna provides more accurate structure predictions better structural sequences wide range than other leading similar
moreover rna fast common rna secondary structure prediction genome scale
studies shown single sequence rna secondary structure not sufficient functional rna random sequence
however multiple rna sequences related species comparative approaches provide additional power identify functional rna structures
one strategy design function predicted rna secondary structures examine difference between distributions real structures structures rna identification based
but one approach generate large number random sequence sets each set real sequences structure predictions sequence sets usually time
difficult find make call between functional random
another strategy classification model based features common structures known functional those random then apply classification model predicted common rna structures determine whether they functional random
rna classification algorithms strategy include
sequence alignment probabilities three probabilistic models rna
both support vector classification models
classification model still generate large number random sequence sets negative training sets make structure predictions them but classification model directly model identify functional without need generate perform random sequences
type sequences used classification models essential their classification performance new sequences
only use their training rna structures multiple rna database but only uses sequence sets high
classification model specific classes using training sets wide range sequence variety rna more
addition training classification model using more predicted rna common structures more classification functional random ones
uses common rna structure prediction
when using sequence its input predicting rna structures sequence sets low
structure prediction accuracy may using structural but might need use structural
paper present new based functional rna
set features represent common rna secondary structures structural generated rna predicts rna structures more than other approaches
rna sets wide range sequence all rna database
more real functional than other leading rna classification including at same positive rate
applied multiple genomes identify rna motifs genes

use wide variety molecules potential applied both
complete genomic sequences multiple other species provide good using comparative approaches
recent predictions dna motifs s will more complete view gene regulation s at different regulation levels
