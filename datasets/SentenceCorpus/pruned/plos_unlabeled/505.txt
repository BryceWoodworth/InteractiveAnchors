sequencing key technique genome structural variation scale
technique particularly useful common cancer produce novel genes
address question how much sequencing required them using both theoretical models simulation
derive formula probability gene exists cancer genome given sequences genome
use formula gene probabilities several cancer samples find able predict genes samples relatively small number large size
further demonstrate how ability genes depends distribution gene evaluate how different parameters sequencing strategy impact detection gene detection even presence errors suggest
results will useful future cancer sequencing particularly studies many cancer genomes sequencing
introduction
cancer disease selection mutations
mutations range single changes
while many mutations been cancer cells via gene techniques there now interest using genome sequencing provide understanding mutations cancer genomes
cancer genome one sequencing sequencing phase point mutations regions
approach genome including
novel genes observed
example gene results many patients
drug gene treatment patients search other genes might provide drug targets
recently was generally their resulting genes only few events were across all types including
view been discovery between gene several protein family cancer cancer
studies question what other
one strategy identification genes other large scale sequencing other genomic dna samples
resulting pairs reference human genome sequence
if then genomic suggested
strategy was described end sequence approach later used genetic structural variation
approach sequencing short identified
present dna sequencing
example genome will able produce length while system applied each end size selected dna many
similar strategies sequencing also been described
whole genome sequencing approaches allow all potential genes other
approach several over protein cancer studies
first discovery genes using expression sequencing depends genes being under specific cellular conditions present sample at time
conditions might different than those cells during development
second at dna sequence level gene due genomic thus less
finally genome sequencing identify more regulatory result when one gene region another gene case gene
paper address number theoretical practical cancer genome using sequencing approaches
where pair reference genome cancer genome
particular idea examine ability genes
specifically if end sequences cancer genome does lead formation gene
sequencing will answer question but requires additional may most sequencing do not genome later analysis
derive formula probability between pair genomic regions given set all empirical distribution
probabilities useful experiments genes
test experiment cancer pairs genes were found
however our analysis revealed only pairs genes high probability were tested experimentally
high sequencing strategies important experimental design questions using understand cancer genome
sequencing more probability genes
however even sequencing would practical cost effective sequence genomes samples
thus important probability genes least amount sequencing
probability depends multiple factors including number length length genes possible errors
here derive several experimental design both current sequencing
our probability simulations demonstrate even current obtain high probability detection very low number
example more than percent all sequencing less than
potentially greater than percent probability less than single machine
