two main agents human strong complex reactions
behaviors responses would control would lead
answer questions developed models cell populations responses
model responses both component component several considered targets each type response
found those even if were present
also compared those fixed rate
reduce but at cost
other hand reduce but if response was
both species between development were associated lower less
thus development might help control
finally our simulations suggest p p same type response though p much smaller subset
since most p suggests p responses more effective than those p

p show loss humans levels produced response p
overall evidence suggests may processes might loss although may other effects
most due p well
p characterized lower levels though often
p all while p up two
previous report makes p potentially much more than growth p population would
thus one might strong response p despite its lower relative p
furthermore model did not response increase while response had effect
here consider p p response response well dynamic system
1 shows basic presented below model section
response aspects response
analyze how components affect dynamics
do not model full complexity response our aim potential between given characteristics responses
however do consider several choices targets both responses model
assume response response same targets
also consider different values time constant effective rate response
time constant not biochemical constant actual also long population
models also standard time develop within
show response affect outcome even presence action
show how outcome life model responses
furthermore show does not help populations responses
most our assume no memory b cells but some examples examine effects
