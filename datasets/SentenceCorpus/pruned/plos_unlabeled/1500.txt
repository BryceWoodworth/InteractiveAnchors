work present novel numerical method analysis stochastic biochemical events use study dynamics
finite state solution develop efficient numerical tools probability
propose new approach sensitivity analysis stochastic events robustness properties regulatory genetic
also propose numerical method expected time cell

introduction
ability cell usually dna
under environments some cells while other cells
probabilistic event dna
been shown among group cells only chosen
modeling noise model phenomenon understanding underlying biological
few cells high concentration key genes including genes systems
pattern system regulatory system
response development
essential sufficient generate expression pattern
specifically concentration must certain threshold positive feedback
different experimental studies activation only needed factor occur expression protein
et
al discuss factors determine required threshold activation other transcription factors lower threshold
although many proteins involved regulation there two main proteins play major role
s et al propose model noise describe dynamics regulation
use reduced order stochastic model presented develop stochastic model
probability expected time requires probabilities first time
problem first time been studied literature stochastic difference some special cases
detailed treatment see
researchers usually use simulations distribution first time when
propose work alternative approach makes possible states system will time
main idea here regions state space over into states
technique useful distribution first time way dimension state space over system
paper
first provides new method exact probabilities biological where behaviors study here occur
second shows how probabilities state respect parameters
third expected time cell its state
all methods used analyze any biological system between two states while while state
paper reactions model
then generate our proposed stochastic model
evolution probability density different states
using stochastic simulation algorithm show how solution using finite state method
then sensitivity analysis effect various system parameters probability cell
analysis shows our proposed numerical method different transcription rates etc cellular
finally analyze parameters expected time cell
