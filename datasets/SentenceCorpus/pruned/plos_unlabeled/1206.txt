threshold firing frequency feature its turn its role activity brain
two main types dynamics been identified brain neurons
type 1 dynamics shows continuous relationship between frequency current thus low frequency at threshold type 2 shows relationship minimum threshold frequency
previous study model demonstrated its dynamics could both type 1 type 2 depending density
present study effect density threshold firing frequency two
moreover model more
models all based studies thus experimentally parameters
choice effects density due their physiological
show using analysis both models type 2 dynamics density
both models region characterized relationship
our results suggest two represent two distinct dependent between type 1 2 dynamics independent dynamics
difference between two membrane types suggests functional differences more role membrane than membrane
introduction
now more than years since firing his classical study
many his experiments still form basis analysis firing patterns systems
using threshold dynamics maximum frequency parameters identified two major classes firing class 1 firing very low frequency at threshold continuous relationship whereas class 2 firing relatively high frequency at threshold relationship
basis similar neurons also been into main classes one class 1 characteristics another class 2 characteristics
class neurons latter
classification been shown corresponding models been used properties neurons
following use terms type 1 type 2 dynamics when continuous relationships
classification threshold dynamics fast neurons class 1 2 into account but not all aspects classes
interactions between many factors involved regulation firing
idea different types explain different patterns
previous study proposed
showed both type 1 type 2 model membrane density
model used was based detailed experimental study thus experimentally estimated parameters
choice parameters was due their physiological
many specifically density both at at level
most used local drug
increasing number studies suggest role physiological regulation even at relatively short time scale
each type dynamics type 1 2 was found associated distinct regions density corresponding formula formula i space
regions high formula low formula values model type 1 dynamics whereas regions higher formula values model type 2 dynamics
analysis showed type 1 dynamics model due
model using region values
type 2 dynamics was found due either local global limit cycle
dynamics model associated region b values due limit cycle while dynamics associated region due limit cycle
limit cycle limit cycle part structure central stable point those stable limit cycle
however suggested structure at between regions b more complex than previously described
when more parameters more loss stability occurs
thus obtain better understanding processes model more
furthermore extended analysis two other
found associated region model show type 2 dynamics both models show type 2 dynamics
investigated mathematical findings using techniques theory
results suggest two studied represent two distinct types membrane respect dependent between type 1 2 dynamics independent dynamics
difference between two membrane types suggests functional differences more role membrane than membrane
