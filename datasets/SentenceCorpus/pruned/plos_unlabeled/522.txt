even though correlation between degree was many independent studies correlation remains
several about between protein protein interaction networks been proposed but demonstrate not properties protein interaction networks
identify main provide biological between network performed analysis protein interaction network obtained using different techniques
demonstrated essential due their essential complex biological group proteins biological function essential proteins
moreover two previously proposed rule one their role overall network connectivity another recently essential protein interactions model
introduction
question analysis biological networks whether biological characteristics protein its network whether biological importance
one first between two context protein interaction network rule was observed who demonstrated nodes protein interaction network contain more essential proteins than would expected
since then correlation between degree was other studies but recently there was no examine correlation
particular what main
number some other more global property essential proteins may protein interaction network
suggested essential proteins among nodes central role play interactions among less proteins
indeed connectivity network measured network size component more than number random nodes
therefore under assumption function depends connectivity among various its would essential because they play central role connectivity
recently hypothesis being function global network structure proposed proteins essential due their one more essential protein protein interactions distributed at random along network
under hypothesis proposed essential because they involved more interactions thus more likely involved one essential
work evaluate each proposed rule
recently several structural properties protein interaction networks biological under main being observed properties due experimental other biases present networks lack any biological
limit impact biases results reported our study use protein interaction network sources interaction evidence
whether related their role network connectivity performed two tests
first if were case then would essential more important network connectivity than
found not case
next addition degree consider several other measures demonstrate some them better role network connectivity than degree
thus if were related network connectivity then one would better correlated measures than degree
however found degree better predictor than any other measure tested
essential protein interaction model used hypothesis testing approach
observed model probability protein essential independent probability another protein essential
however tested networks proteins interaction correlated
thus assumption result essential protein interaction model high confidence
our findings propose alternative rule
our effect experiments function group related genes genes whose gene same complex
well known proteins biological function
therefore one would protein interaction networks should either essential proteins
indeed observed essential proteins not distributed among set
work same phenomenon potentially larger groups related proteins call complex biological
demonstrate due distribution essential proteins among essential proteins those essential proteins call essential complex biological
very contain relative their size more essential nodes than random group proteins same size
but what all essential
how does number what expected
fact how does essential proteins values expected under
propose essential proteins
support hypothesis found essential proteins among depending network only percent almost low network average
furthermore nodes not only correlated their degree
finally using experiment demonstrated properties protein interaction network corresponding network
