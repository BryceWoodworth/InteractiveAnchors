however genetic program single remains
order obtain understanding studied distributions parameters group four neurons visual system
found parameters were similar all cells
only parameters area were cell type specific
were based optimization amount synaptic
although same rule was used all cells structures their real
derived procedure rule
suggest genetic program could constant all cells whereas one field should cell specific
introduction
most feature cells typically used them
represent input region neurons role complex computational
typically way local global parameters
very little known about general rule leading their distinct due wide variety among different neurons
same neurons across individuals rather their constant their function
cells visual system therefore subjects basic rule formation
they local motion information over elements
their area corresponding their distinct primary
paper potential fundamental may lead individual
