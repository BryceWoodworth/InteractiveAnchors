introduction
previously both complex simple models transmission dynamics been determine what population would need
however modeling studies shown whether critical actually
here investigate modeling decisions made individuals whether critical through
construct model human behavior model dynamics
assume decision each individual based upon without having
since against less than one individuals must every whether not program
individuals who themselves but if they do not they may still if sufficient numbers their
individual whether necessary
model each strategy making decisions adaptive process error
both decisions variables
use our model address following
our adaptive decision-making model game
game models how individuals behavior respect common under adaptation each
past games been used model systems financial
our model population n individuals their own who do not their decisions each other
every individuals whether not against using highly effective
assumed no real risk individuals do not any risk
individuals model characterized two biological attributes they use when making decisions
individuals their behavior current basis their their past they use make decisions
our model adaptive decision-making model dynamics
our models show effect decisions effect decisions
first use our model whether without could achieve critical levels necessary control
then potential impact two use
there two major classes health investigated our models
first class uses decisions same individual over many
second class uses decisions individuals population one
many additional characteristics two classes
first health program investigate example first class
program free number years individual who first
assume individual each during years free but also every
at end years each individual program then uses their whether not program
if they choose they free further years
second health program analyze example second class
program family free if family own
assume family every whether program depending upon how many family were previous
