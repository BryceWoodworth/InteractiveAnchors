cells complex intrinsic dynamics
they exhibit via network interactions involved high frequency activity
properties cells measured their phase response
change phase stimulus function its temporal position within widely used predict responses more complex stimulus patterns
significant during firing lead low over trials
show using experiments simulations way sampling current
introduce approach bias
using our new approach show cell change depending firing frequency cell
at high firing rates cells exhibit
at low firing rates cell independent phase neurons
results cells at low firing rates integration cells depends their firing rate
introduction
cells exhibit wide range
they intrinsic neural firing highly synaptic input at rate
they also exhibit intrinsic their responses
addition interactions between firing cells result activity high frequency may temporal patterns network
hence firing cells highly time thus they represent targets systems analysis
phase response study dynamics at cellular level
effect firing phase used predict response more complex patterns
type stability network properties
cell therefore essential step explore their dynamic their mechanisms construct models cells determine their role information processing at network level
obtained directly membrane potential short current synaptic via methods
using direct method obtained current while neurons firing action
phase phase measured using current reference paper
show using experiments simulations present cells bias
bias results loss current region call
introduce method bias using all reference one at time
obtained method
note our study both using same experimental firing cells current
using method show cell changes depending firing rate
