genome wide studies test between common genetic disease shown
while many factors could potentially studies focus multiple may influence disease
here describe algorithm analysis
algorithm low effect
further does not require
simulations over range assumed population risk values power our approach over other methods including strategies
method apply data individuals at body distribution
individual samples were at two genes known involved
analysis one significantly associated region each gene each about regulatory regions
data suggests help expression two genes leading corresponding
overall our results point power including genetic associations
introduction
common disease common hypothesis common genomic population
basis genome wide studies test between individual genomic disease
using common studies been significant associations many common well several quantitative
studies been
significant genetic not been several common known strong genetic component
many common associations studies account only small disease
while many factors could potentially studies focus multiple may influence disease
alternative hypothesis common disease hypothesis been much recent shown disease multiple studies
example been reduced lower levels cancer
while some studies shown increase risk recent study also multiple genes reduced reduced risk
mutations been shown against type 1
studies others focused regions genes using sequencing
recent dna sequencing made possible large genome manner
studies impact complex
however several properties make their genetic effects difficult current approaches
provide review properties differences between common analysis
example if disease common then will low
even highly more common genetic might study common disease
therefore tests associations likely low power
if hypothesis combination multiple must population risk
case there between disease
methods associations only just being developed
natural approach strategy where multiple at into single
strategies low power when combined
recently proposed disease individuals
their approach according their frequency sample low frequency being more
each individual weights mutations
test then if individuals more than expected
show formula group being combined formula associations high power
while effective approach depends upon high formation test statistics strong significant
their simulations among all assumption may not always
combined method proposed into groups based upon
individual 1 group if any group
approach then each groups analysis explain disease risk
combination approach analysis results increase power over multiple approaches
however point out method correct
power reduced functional group
groups may fact power below through single analysis
indeed recent analysis suggests new methods might needed when both low low values
here focus method only subset at
consider formula set formula
formula possible any subset formula at formula
at first approach many problems
first optimal subset formula
show approach optimal subset scales making associations large set
second factor large number different tests at increase likelihood
required control type i error could power method
however simulations show
our results suggest formula small formula sufficient significant
well current power studies common other methods detection
also applied analysis two genes pathway large sequencing study individuals
pathway important variety functions
upon brain variety other been shown influence weight gain models
using receptor leads reduced
levels been shown
signaling brain including
gene expression studies show significantly levels well
while evidence points genetic multiple recent studies using common region
was associated but not been other data
tested hypothesis multiple at associated
used data where regions were using next individuals taken body distribution subjects large
identified number common region
applied determine if multiple genetic effects
identified single region at each formula formula
each case significant was gene consistent regulatory function
