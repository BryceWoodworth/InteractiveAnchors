central problem gene regulation find binding sites regulatory proteins
one most approaches short sequence patterns comparative analysis regions related species
analysis various factors
first one take relationship between species into account order due functional sites due evolutionary
second one multiple regions one consider functional sites may occur conserved
here present new sampling algorithm arbitrary multiple local sequence sequences
algorithm over all ways arbitrary number binding sites arbitrary number transcription factors multiple sequence
binding site bayesian probabilistic model sequences model evolution binding sites dna
model relationship between species alignment explicitly into account
algorithm uses sampling probabilities all binding sites
tests data real data species our algorithm significantly better than four other algorithms including algorithms also take into account
our results also show contrast other algorithms make estimates its predictions
our tests suggest multiple alignment single region average over percent all binding sites s at about percent percent all binding sites at about percent
also tested multiple regions were recently based data contain binding sites same
compared results previous analysis data using other algorithms
all other methods find significant did literature
cases where there was results known target genes literature found their regulatory regions binding matching literature all but one cases
literature gene had little targets based data

full set predicted sites our tests yeast available at
introduction
transcription factors proteins manner short dna most dna gene gene transcription
their domains short related dna sequences
one generally although there no unique combination all binding sites although different occur at each position there clear biases distribution occur at each position binding sites
common mathematical representation into account weight matrix whose components i give probabilities finding base c g t at position i binding site
main assumption underlying mathematical representation at different binding site independent
turn follows under some conditions assumption binding energy protein dna contact between individual protein
there several algorithms based representation binding sites common dna sequences
algorithms into two classes
one class space all best explain observed sequences
class sampling algorithms instead samples space all multiple small sequence search one most likely samples common
factor methods number binding sites total amount dna sequences
larger number binding sites set smaller total amount dna more likely methods binding sites among other dna sequences
order one thus provide methods sequences highly binding sites common
one use sets regions genes appear experiments were bound common experiments
another use regions genes related organisms
here assumption regulation gene thus its binding sites been conserved
latter approach general number factors
when regulatory sites sequences not related regions different genes same one may simply short sequence motifs among input sequences
if set species sequences derive one may simply choose relationship between sequences sequences same way sequences not related
was instance approach taken et al where algorithm was used regions
however approach not datasets more related species where some sequences will exhibit significant similarity simply because their evolutionary
moreover amount similarity will depend distance between species clear finding conserved sequence motifs between sequences related species much less function than finding sequence motifs conserved between species
one will general thus due functional constraints due evolutionary do relationship between sequences taken into account
second using sequences multiple species structure their multiple
one typically very pattern different different species sequence show little similarity sequences other species
technique attention only those sequence genome interest show significant other species
conserved regions multiple genes then common motifs variety techniques
however what extent regulatory sites conserved
instance several studies yeast shown there no strong correlation between where experimentally binding sites occur whether region conserved
thus at least yeast information conserved regions only
thus pattern conserved sequence
our strategy sampling approach account algorithm was presented
algorithm arbitrary both related sequences regions sequences not related regions different genes same
related groups sequences input into local multiple where similar sequence into sequence no similarity
although algorithm also take global multiple input often into
may affect performance algorithm
sites within sequences evolutionary model relationships species into account while sites independent
bayesian model probability distribution over arbitrary binding sites multiple motifs sample markov
first use search optimal binding sites
motifs then further sampling estimate probabilities all binding sites algorithm
recently number other algorithms been developed search regulatory motifs groups related sequences
first algorithm was proposed generalization algorithm called
sets genes their
algorithm first similar sequence sets sequences then different regions into larger
algorithm does not take any information into account related sequences same related sequences
other algorithm each will one site each regions site conserved all
more related approach two recent algorithms take relationships between species into account
main difference between uses same evolutionary model evolution binding sites into account binding sites under constraints set whereas simply overall rate evolution binding sites than sequences
another difference like multiple alignment more than global multiple alignment
main difference between algorithms sampling approach allows us search multiple motifs whereas use maximization search one at time
following first describe our bayesian model probability each binding sites multiple motifs input sequences
model sequences model used then describe how model extended datasets contain related sequences
after describe set search state space all possible strategy use identify significant groups sites
then present examples performance other algorithms both real data
datasets samples random sequences assumptions all algorithms make
allows us compare performance algorithms situation does not contain real data
tests also show what extent binding sites data function quality number sites available number species available their
our tests real data use regions known binding sites compare ability different algorithms sites when multiple regions recently genomes
finally region were contain binding sites common based data experiments compare results literature
