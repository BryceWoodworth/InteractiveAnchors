genes common functions often exhibit correlated expression levels used identify sets genes data
typically measure expression across genomic space matrix must only most relevant gene interactions

used function about genes based known functions genes they
our method data
analysis used identify sets genes whose interactions
correlation graph also
present several examples multiple gene interactions thus represent potential molecular pathways response
introduction
assumption genes similar expression patterns common cellular functions body effort cellular pathways data
general genes proteins common pathway will correlated expression levels when at sufficient scale known functions genes used existing new functional pathways
number recent studies concept genes across multiple conditions more likely represent common functions than would expected
computational methods patterns far general about their utility
methods pathways data measure similarity distance correlation degree expression levels between pairs genes correlated across multiple conditions
matrix across typically similarity expression patterns genes point genes into clusters
clustering wide variety algorithms data into groups similar expression patterns clustering approaches been proposed
however there several important clustering algorithms contrast biology
first they gene only one
while amount data biology under study many genes play important multiple but distinct pathways
other main problem most measures similarity used clustering algorithms do not recognition negative also common
alternative genes clusters correlation matrix graph only whose weights value
described graphs networks
network both positive negative threshold visual recognition highly genes
recent studies networks genes cancer cells
while those provided gene biological conditions they were limited relationships could graphs
networks contain many gene sets represent potential common pathways
without means relationships between multiple genes however many most relationships within
developed computational approach graph theoretical algorithms identify genes present networks
most case contains all possible between structure called
terms gene expression most potential set genes
however problem problem its own
previously developed novel graph algorithms allow time
recently applied algorithms identify genes part effort quantitative associated neural function
here algorithms identify gene relationships interactions specific treatment
our approach using set data was generated
well known agent dna at relatively high but
response lower however those defined dependent upon genetic
data used were derived study role genetic response
were after gene expression changes were using
describe our graph genes correlated expression levels demonstrate biological method provides
