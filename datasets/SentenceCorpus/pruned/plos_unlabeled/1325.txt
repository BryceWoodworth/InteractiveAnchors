interaction between n interaction structure seems interaction
interaction between leading more open structure binding
experiments shown most structure some structure may related fact
although different mechanisms been proposed explain physiological relationship between interaction between at molecular level unknown
detailed knowledge however important understanding mechanisms may also help identify potential target sites where interaction between
present study using molecular simulations based global minimum energy investigate interaction process domain different order determine potential binding sites
next step molecular dynamics explore conformational dynamics under interaction evaluate stability each
