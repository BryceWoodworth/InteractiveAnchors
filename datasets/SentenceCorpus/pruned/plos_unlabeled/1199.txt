within assumption system our modeling suggests at rather compared other general factors despite importance complex
modeling any pathway given all proteins together form complex
introduction
genes thought proteins into at using pathway
one pathway involves general transcription factors
then rna other transcription
fundamental question our understanding gene regulation extent each step distinct at every gene genome
biochemical view manner formation
process simply process
pathway been defined few proteins dna provided us our current view regulation
no case reactions been way physiological setting at every gene so questions open extent defined reactions events genome
answer question not since reactions not biochemical reactions components
do exist relative levels protein dna complex formation so will
goal here evaluate data biochemical mechanisms corresponding reaction
extent biological rather subjective assumptions associated data
within context constraints assumptions propose means model data so better genomic datasets
study focused means modeling assumptions data using specific examples
most widely used measure proteins at genes
proteins dna protein then bound dna identified either through through detection
way example relative level many other proteins at every genome population cells
recent studies using experiments provided evidence dynamic state components cells
therefore now within framework factors like rna other multiple at each transcription event rather than simple view place during multiple transcription
existence distinct levels components genes not been thus modeling studies described here
patterns been described may influence specific general transcription factors thus mechanisms might differ gene gene
here binding information at every yeast genome either mechanisms
major any approach number possible mechanisms amount data available mechanisms
other words data pathway
additional constraints either pathway might however certain mechanisms data thus mechanisms rather than mechanism
here develop modeling program context fixed pathway mechanisms
simulation using existing
within constraints different mechanisms at every gene yeast genome existing data
