introduction
main disease two major developed
though previously was within now widely role disease
some time effects high been known
variety effects observed result large numbers cells associated functional affected
among effects direct structures including especially occur both patients experimental
there evidence risk disease at much lower long time after life study various groups although not all
they likely mechanisms effects low disease not clear
interest levels but also increased levels been observed
there was also rate levels total all
paper mathematical model disease based hypothesis
mathematical various factors process formation
not only but also disease at early disease but treatment later lead
model some extent based model et al although there significant model
particular features generally rather models et al et al
stability analysis version model will performed
particularly mechanisms effects low model case cell pathway
