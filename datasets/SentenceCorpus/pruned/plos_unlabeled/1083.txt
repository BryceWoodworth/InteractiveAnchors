one most critical problems study biological systems accurate statistical them
problem been particularly because biological systems typically contain large numbers elements use standard approaches
recently though several groups reported there may strategy
show statistical models without knowledge all interactions instead interactions
findings however based analysis small
here whether observations will systems size whether models will provide true biological systems
our results show most cases they will not
there predictive power if size below point then results no predictive power large systems
if size above point then results may predictive power
work thus provides general framework extent models used predict behavior large biological systems
applied neural data size most systems studied so far below point
introduction
many fundamental questions biology probabilistic setting
instance neural requires knowledge probability patterns activity response stimuli features protein important correct requires knowledge probability particular sequence amino patterns their social individual behavior requires knowledge distribution species over both space time
probability distributions however
there several biological systems large numbers elements so exhibit number fact large number elements typically each other making view system independent because biological systems very little data
example current only about neurons out human brain
so not only problem probability distributions high must do based small neurons network
despite recent work suggested situation may less than seems accurate statistical description systems without having examine all possible
one measure probability distribution over pairs elements use those full distribution
models potentially fundamental number pairs number elements not
however support models relatively small small true probability distribution could measured experimentally
while studies provided key first step critical question will results analysis small large ones
if model predicts probability distribution subset elements system will also predict probability distribution whole system
here find relevant class systems question independent many biological system under
answer generally no
paper explain both simulations why case
