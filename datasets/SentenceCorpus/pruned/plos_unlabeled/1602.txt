introduction
understanding dynamics single neurons networks neurons dependent synaptic requires how single synaptic input into activity
if activity constant rate membrane potential distribution its state properties how input output rate
fast input neural dynamics gains importance
model well properties neurons more detailed models
features neural membrane potential synaptic each small further input level
if potential threshold action potential membrane potential
treatment threshold process nature input
applied approximation synaptic limit small while their rate high
limit input noise current application theory
approximation membrane potential distribution firing rate known
important effect synaptic been studied limit synaptic noise temporal
results only if synaptic tend their rate
finite synaptic events only state solution still obtained also solution obtained numerical solution population
different approach into account synaptic first free membrane potential distribution then obtain firing rate first time problem
approach may based
exact results state so far only been presented case distributed synaptic
threshold model
however if synaptic input signal under small compared total synaptic linear approximation main characteristics response
all noise
linear response kernel limit suggested model
here synaptic input properties contrast noise synaptic noise leads fast response conserved linear term
linear response theory predicts optimal level noise response
