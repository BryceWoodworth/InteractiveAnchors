well various regions wide neural processes yet mechanisms processes into activity
propose important role respect might structures information between regions involved
hypothesis present neural network model set structures activity group activity patterns information between them
resulting dynamics allows network perform task either image during delay image another one been associated during training
model behavioral data temporal same tasks
also makes predictions how neural activity image associated sample during training phase
network dynamics very stable against
present network possible neural active memory
model suggests brain activity leading performance cognitive tasks might simple neural functions into more complex behavior structures
introduction
important question how neural activity itself produce behavior
studies specific cognitive functions provided very detailed into how different regions brain behavior
more specifically they shown role various regions functions visual representation stimuli memory stimulus representation tasks rules selection response among set memory
however remains how different regions together even behavior
indeed even action at object requires neural processes take place order
here propose behavior generated set functions above if information regions contain each other control structures manner task at hand
activity behavior might then simple functions would selected necessary neural
hypothesis present neural network model able response task was introduced study memory using visual associations
task sample trials require subject either memory image during delay image associated
type performed subject during delay
network contains structures each them one functions task visual representation memory memory
control activity information between them
neural necessary perform tasks firing patterns control depend strongly both type phase
resulting dynamics allows network then task while data temporal similar tasks
