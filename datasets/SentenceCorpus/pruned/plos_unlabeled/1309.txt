frequency every combination during development system
issue model able account gene during development
so developed numerical model whole based experimental data estimate how genes become
gene through different different
furthermore secondary was
model points out some associations resulting gene genes depending their
model shows sufficient explain use all genes
finally model provides information both each associations
model essential features observed may provide reference
introduction
functional expressed t generated during gene variable constant
mechanism dependent both complex
more than functional genes
theory each genes may target one functional genes
use genes during process been widely studies support not random use at end end
region at end c gene two t early at end region
both e
e all associations whereas two required genes at end region
however analyses those transcription showed significant use support hypothesis both first genes
its ability multiple secondary
process either positive selection expression cell
therefore impact secondary gene regulation remains defined
gene use suggested first targets secondary one into set involved primary
rules use genes not been
observations use would genes region towards genes region
at point time mechanism involved control genes remains
current state analysis some those at but still complete estimation
main fact some genes similar region central part making their identification molecular methods
numerical process may support difficulty global view
instance if genes chosen sequential way model their use results whereas known experimental data two
us mathematical model experimental data all genes including those central
between data obtained experiments makes possible estimation parameters associations more accurate estimation
