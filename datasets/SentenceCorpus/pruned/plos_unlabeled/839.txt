order binding sites protein sequences developed algorithm sequence information binding experiments structural parameters
show combination significantly either single approach
predictor had correlation when over tested sequences true true
test robustness learning set where sequences learning sets rate them
good
algorithm was also able perform well test set there was no prior knowledge learning sets

introduction
molecular part quality control functions protein
family been proteins larger proteins
molecules also cell during conditions characterized increased concentration
through regions protein core

molecular two distinct domains domain binding domain
function dependent cycle binding
bound low open state
bound conformational change high state
function
also may
upon low state binding another another cycle same if necessary
well characterized e bound binding core region basic residues overall
preference was later work binding studies binding was derived
previous studies binding only sequence information experimental binding information set structural data obtain accurate predictor
similar based approaches been shown predict other
prediction binding class i molecules was structural information molecular models sequence data
et al used structural data various sequence information predict binding different domains
recently algorithm predict regions protein sequences combination sequence based data structural information studies
article introduce based method binding sequences
sequence based information experimental binding structural information molecular via field
present binding prediction algorithm under conditions accurate
