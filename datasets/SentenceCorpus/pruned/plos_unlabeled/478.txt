introduction
despite relatively small number genes human genome there many examples groups genes perform similar functions
could either evolutionary
could result different functional environments genes might play very different functional
here explore how functional constraints bound evolution through analysis
primary function allow action
since mathematical models suggested properties need action potential
there different genes many more than percent sequence
one hand sequence similarity similarity their functional consistent idea properties must
other hand genes why so many different mechanisms action potential necessary
found specific regions they might specific functions
example central at
paper address questions whether how theoretical constraints action potential properties must allow membrane there must exist threshold above action potential produced unique potential
through theoretical analysis demonstrate two depend only properties directly activation directly measured experiments
then compare constraints measurements reported literature
our uses different measurements distinct including both human under range different conditions including without different types
tend associated disease state hence differ significant way
our analysis properties into four different groups
within each group there strong positive correlation between activation
each four groups close according analysis
what functional differences between groups
two groups expressed
another group potential threshold higher than other
group only produce action range even then maximum threshold less than
into distinct groups suggests they perform tasks
