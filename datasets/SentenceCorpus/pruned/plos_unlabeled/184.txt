individual model new metric relative identify both potential sequences binding between

additional analysis bias 1 genes used not furthermore 1 genes whose sequence was associated free energy less than were within
most likely sequence genes
way new metric provides method gene sequence
strong 1 genes appear their sequences
thus our metric provides new way explore role
introduction
end rna observed part sequence was several
they combined observation previously experimental evidence suggested between region was sufficient stable structure could position during
also since been sequence
theory was experimentally et al
since two different approaches been used identify position sequences sequence similarity free energy
methods based sequence similarity include sequences at least three long
identification errors approach several
threshold similarity does not exist actual sequences sites significant but low degree similarity sequence
lack number observations gene sequences appear themselves into two those sequences those without
sequence techniques exact sequence problem because its affect
second approach using free energy based proposed mechanism binding sequence analysis
occurs between sequence significant effect
formation between basis results more stable structure lower free energy than sequences
one model degree stability rna secondary structure change energy
method free energy been identify sequences g values region
all studies observed negative g whose sequence
second approach both identify sequence its exact having g value
however exact sequence dependent algorithm position
further free energy analysis through into region genes new metric relative
metric binding across region relative us binding involves well sequences
also independent length property allows comparison binding between species
sequences could explore lack any region
lack any other sequence motifs could
one hypothesis been
thus there search highly conserved sequences been observed many
study use metric identify g genes species test its means improve existing tools sequences
genes where binding place one at 1
genes strong binding
then determine if genes were
