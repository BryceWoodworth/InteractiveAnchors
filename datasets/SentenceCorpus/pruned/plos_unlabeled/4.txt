analyses been organisms whose complete genome sequences available
each complete set membrane systems was identified predicted functions into protein based classification system
organisms larger genome generally relatively greater number systems
significant factor increase genome size was greater types
contrast greater number specific was more important factor increase genome size
both limited
clustering derived presence certain family showed clustering patterns organisms were correlated both their evolutionary history their overall
introduction
membrane systems play essential cellular
function environmental cell communication other important cellular functions
various systems differ their membrane energy mechanisms
among energy sources energy form
classification system approach systems according their energy mechanism molecular
energy mechanism primary basis classification because their relatively stable characteristics
there four major classes classification primary secondary group
unknown mechanism function distinct class
specific types small molecules concentration they higher rates lower than other classes
primary active process primary source energy
secondary process
e one best characterized secondary
group their during process
example e using energy source into cell
each class further into individual according their function
since genomic sequencing complete sequences over genomes been wide range species human
there also more than additional genome sequencing world
effective computational methods required analyze amount data generated sequencing
at proteins understanding metabolic organisms
however often proteins current primary methods because large complex gene major presence multiple gene many organisms
been analysis cellular membrane systems
