proteins active perform range different functions
experimental approaches may now provide limited information about conformational changes along motion pathways proteins
there therefore need computational approaches prior information into motion prediction
paper present general designed integration prior information into motion algorithm random
each suggested motion pathway sequence arbitrary number prior information constraints
constraints derived experimental data about motion
prior information very significantly search typically conformational space leading reduction time
allow use energy functions conformational sampling framework into accurate types structural modeling
suggested framework effective molecular dynamics normal analysis other techniques predicting motion proteins
applied our framework three different model systems
show limited set experimentally constraints may bias simulations distance constraints
particular our analysis mechanisms protein domain role different residues motion
introduction
understanding protein structural explore molecular
two structures were first time structural into motion protein were its image
finding way classical model binding proteins
proteins known multiple together their suggested molecular motion
number increases structures protein data
fundamental protein functions signal regulation
motion protein structures essential understanding their function particular understanding control mechanisms allow protein
understanding relation between protein sequence protein motion allow design dynamic proteins our knowledge about transition states provide
accurate prediction protein motion also help address other computational
instance normal analysis motion predictions used efficient introduction into
experimental knowledge been limited fact structures stable proteins sense dynamic
while high experimental data molecular motion still single energy well methods now provide detailed experimental data molecular motion distance constraints measurements motion
