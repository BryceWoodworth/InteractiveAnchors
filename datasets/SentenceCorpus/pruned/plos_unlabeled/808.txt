mutations give central core disease
structures limited our understanding function disease mechanisms at molecular level
here report structural model region
molecular dynamics simulations show high binding residues experimentally known critical
also 2 over
simulations show loss preference 2 seen experimentally
experiments central core disease show open but not 2
our simulations show preference 2 over
together computational experimental results at level
introduction
upon 2
2 about receptor 2
large present
they high while being
important mutations result central core disease
although important molecular basis their function
unique properties their not seen other known structures
next there two residues essential normal
but contrast only one negative not even conserved while other 2 only one conserved negative position
mutations result leading
structural model region would function residues will useful understanding role residues function
early model potential within corresponding three binding sites
without any knowledge structure model was able data various
model role residues high
was 2 could most least space compared however since model used simulations fixed structure could not predict changes due mutations potentially structure
there two models region based whose solution structure known
et al used approaches construct models related
their model at resulting being
however shown residues important suggests they part pathway resulting predicted being
et al also model receptor using structure performed simulations identify residues important function
their simulations identify important what been shown experimentally
furthermore revealed significant differences between region
experimental structure been performed
studies revealed conformational changes binding sites various
thus able provide only limited structural information structure
et al structure into region their
furthermore they predicted presence at least simple constraints
et al identified several secondary structure elements their
region et al long made up residues made up residues long made up residues
since structure derived structure unknown
molecular model region based their study residues
furthermore our molecular dynamics simulations examine interactions region known
