thus there need computational methods evaluate regulatory before difficult task experimental
developed novel computational framework transcription factor binding site gene expression information evaluate whether regulatory model likely target given set genes
our basic approach predict regulatory associated given gene set transcription factor binding site motifs within predicted
model system examined experimentally demonstrated expression two genes cells cells
was previously general regulation genes expressed cell population
contrast present analyses suggest form regulatory only subset cell genes those whose gene expression specific genetic similar manner gene original model was based
hypothesis experimentally new expression four expression cells
introduction
central structure genetic regulatory networks development methods whether set transcription factors given set genes
although classical approaches allow identification key their approximate within genetic directly gene expression required experimental identification individual regulatory
process several groups recently demonstrated computational approaches identify accuracy especially when computational known
best made several groups genes expressed during system where years genetic identified
most biological systems however set either unknown
therefore order approaches identify component regulation novel biological systems additional computational methods needed identify component regulation
address question systems developed initial statistical framework regulatory models
model system examined regulation class genes regulatory model been previously datasets been generated
cells signal combination within
prior experimental work using gene single each provided detailed model integration three signaling pathways at pathways t cell factor against were demonstrated expression within
additional was shown provided two
thus single model regulation genes expressed was where signaling cues appropriate expression domain
genetic analysis expression series gene expression been determined et al
addition cells performed expression analyses pathways were genetic
each genetic was predicted based example increase expression those genes expression
expression were then combined into single was used predict additional genes
et al performed over predicted genes their experiments genes
present work expression data et al evaluate gene expression
previous computational sequence identified additional gene expression transcription factor binding site motifs example was not unique
however model could not those two examples therefore developed method motifs sequences genes
approach term not only each but also all given set
analysis apply all genes
rather found three likely specific subset genes changes their gene expression response genetic used et al
thus gene expression data our analysis allows initial model subset original subset genes
test hypothesis four our
