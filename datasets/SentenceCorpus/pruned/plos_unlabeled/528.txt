long after new been learned few words seems other words
learning effect been demonstrated both humans neural network models
specifically previous work linear networks learn set associations then them all finally some associations show performance associations
here prove associations performance effect call negative learning
difference between learning negative learning presented here due particular method used
specifically if weight vectors then learning observed
however here if weight values simply towards then negative learning observed
biological perspective systems networks used here suggests evolution may selected physiological mechanisms involve using form synaptic rather than synaptic because synaptic but not synaptic learning
introduction
idea structural changes formation new
more recently proposed when cell b part firing some growth process metabolic change place one both cells one cells firing b increased
now widely learning involves some form adaptation body evidence suggests adaptation associated observed systems
increase synaptic occurs presence activity specific single
one adaptation information specific distributed many synaptic therefore distributed representation each
participants learned
after participants subset
performance
however whereas some associations shows evidence some studies not found not all studies
may because many studies performed investigate general phenomenon use wide variety different some others recognition performance example
however within one relevant effect known
occurs when subject part set previously learned items found reduce items
however showed learned words was better if cues subset words their learned than if cue words were other
case seems improve performance but only if each part spatial position was learned
consistent effect reported using procedure but no network models
if brain information distributed then each many associations
therefore some associations should affect other associations learned at about same time
above previous work shown some associations does not other associations but them
effect also been demonstrated neural network models where evolution adaptive behaviors
some associations other associations addition noise weights could result effect small random changes weights
contrast here prove if weights towards so weights towards then some associations other associations
used examine here same used follows
first learn set n 1 n 2 associations 1 2 two 1 2 n 1 n 2 associations
after all learned associations been measure performance error subset 1
finally only subset 2 then performance subset 1
occurs if subset 2 performance 1
order common network n weights assumed n n 1 n 2 number weights each output not less than number n 1 n 2 learned associations
using class linear network models described below up n associations learned
below network one output
however apply networks multiple output because n each output considered distinct network case our results applied network associated each output
each input vector corresponding target value d network weight vector response input vector define performance error input vectors 1 d 1 d i i output response input vector i t d t 1
two 1 2 n 1 n 2 associations
let network weight vector after 1 2 learned
when 1 2 network weight vector changes 1 performance error 1 e e finally 2 new weight vector 2 performance error 1 e e learning if performance error 1 less after 2 than was before 2
given weight vectors 1 2 matrix input vectors vector d also simply
previous work assumed vector distribution
here assume instead weight vector 1 given some so making optimal weight vector towards factor 1
