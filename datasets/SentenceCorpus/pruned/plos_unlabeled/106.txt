introduction
formation associated increase structure leads
however should increased level structure property several different types protein
addition proteins observed recent studies shown proteins not related any disease into under conditions
normal proteins become when they
there no about different small large
significant recent research discovery species may not themselves but rather
possible mechanism been demonstrated
been shown form like cell resulting cell
therefore mechanism formation under
recognition factors influence protein conformational changes one general fundamental problems solution will help us find effective
experimental observation not all proteins specific continuous regions proteins more than others suggests there sequence formation
moreover observation some short also form usually environment transition proteins into state suggests formation
mechanism proteins observed into both
been suggested residues important
means structure provide specific
thus understand molecular mechanism necessary find factors proteins formation at physiological conditions
some disordered proteins involved
fact may necessary condition
been shown very small change environment proteins often might their
knowledge characteristics control process formation important finding effective treatment
their review protein requires
first been obtained
recently structure was determined
each
two form
within each every bound two through both
there several computational methods predicting formation
work et al was shown concentration might
but analysis revealed might necessary but not sufficient condition
computational algorithm been suggested sequences relationships between protein local sequence secondary structure terms
algorithm sequences within protein formation
here both algorithms prediction properties considered above applied only those proteins structure known
based properties sequences computational algorithm model was developed predicting rate range
model sites within protein predicts
should however sites were not
other hand there method prediction regions amino sequence
after experimental properties model its authors obtained pattern used pattern identification proteins
pattern been used protein indeed short protein
been demonstrated protein into particular structural environment
recently new method proteins been suggested
method based through known structure
prediction prediction if its energy lower than threshold energy
should molecular dynamics information about structural changes at level upon formation while information difficult obtain experimentally
another new method based interaction between pairs protein statistical analysis proteins
algorithm predicts most some
formation sufficient number interactions necessary loss conformational entropy during protein process
therefore structural proteins result between conformational entropy energy interactions
seems disordered regions protein do not sufficient number interactions loss conformational entropy results formation state
other hand large increase energy interactions will lead loss unique structure because contact energy will up but also likely lead
been suggested lack structure under physiological conditions might represent functional advantage disordered proteins their large allows them several different targets compared protein limited conformational
been shown disordered regions involved dna binding other types molecular recognition
large sequences disordered proteins contain low complexity high predicted
also been combination low overall large represent structural feature disordered proteins comparison small proteins
there several widely used methods prediction disordered simple approach tendency residues secondary able experimentally disordered proteins proteins various machine learning regions structures but specifically support vector machine residues basis their ability form
were first our knowledge who used number per parameter disordered proteins
extended our method predict disordered regions made methods
been demonstrated our method best among widely used methods sets proteins considered here
despite understand mechanism still what disordered regions
goal work test our hypothesis about whether protein regions expected strong density properties proteins while regions density disordered regions
introduce new parameter mean density prediction both disordered regions protein sequence
findings support concept disordered regions similar basis different proteins
