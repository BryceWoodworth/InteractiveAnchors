produce high fundamental frequency during contrast who low fundamental frequency
critical step understanding communication complexity manner
at source often difficult here finite model model both based
model produce wide range fundamental
low fundamental require low but large large if level at distance
requires both large effort high but at least more level
power power at higher advantage signaling
advantage based two first lower required power second advantage at higher
both signal types used during signals
two signal types physical
overall body size via strong relationship between parameters size body size
may signal via at mechanism critical
introduction
based body size some large use
between low frequency high frequency signaling characteristics so two related
during one species low frequency while other its high frequency
signals communication generally very complex because various them
complexity related natural selection
example signal considered if information about body size physical
body size physical important its its interactions
call was selected low characteristics provide information about body size due factors involved
contrast difficult make case body size high fundamental frequency
contain low frequency components but not

what evolution would generally associated much smaller
here investigate physiological related high low frequency
model within framework intrinsic model goal better understand system
finite model was based
