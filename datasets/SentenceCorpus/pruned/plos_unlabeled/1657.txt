gene developed corresponding design
given input output our algorithm several possible without need any optimization

simulations up four show representation even under stochastic noise
comparison addition potential same function

introduction
central concept biology rational design gene means standard dna functions
field at methods part biology
several computational tools been developed
moreover some tools way
design able target function not task its major biology
previously showed small networks characterized behavior obtained evolutionary optimization set independent
similar tools like use dynamic optimization
approaches but they several
computational complexity requires very models do not represent basic but genes
optimization only rather small networks requires optimization structure parameter values
hence more direct rational design methods
here instead general solution design focus
where input output signals take only two 1
case uses two input signals single output
more complex formula into single output
both cases relation represented where each one possible formula input signal values corresponding binary output
biology important several
first those determined action two different natural systems
they often found motifs provide more
more complex networks several basic control b well system c
analysis possible could thus help further our understanding natural biological networks
biology complex required molecular
should cues may
more better ability between similar environmental conditions
could instance into
furthermore they could play important role disease treatment et al control cells response signals environment
even more complex could work molecular perform basis if necessary
two aspects several gene been experimentally past years
most rely control
fact well known behavior when two transcription factors
more complex been instance cells
however number generally used biology low rational transcription factors complex process
nature mechanisms control like between structural due binding
complex rna structures made two where either structural binding
both either
furthermore where single under control two been observed b
two distinct natural
taking structures models similar rna been recently
particular complex most common
design small compared design transcription factors
despite individual biology tools computational design
points design because target function defined
here approaches design our previous model design develop method design gene
process modeling
use set standard biological whose parameters take appropriate values without any optimization algorithms
addition previously developed consider binding sites
method requires only directly produce several possible process up four different unique output signal
design alternatives according complexity practical
simulations single networks different complexity validity our approach accurate representation robustness designed
