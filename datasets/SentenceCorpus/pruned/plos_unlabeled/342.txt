study mathematical modeling sensitivity analysis were used explore hypothesis models human despite model uncertainty points mechanisms could targets
tested our hypothesis model developed literature
predicted mechanisms were then compared treatment literature
model proteins protein protein interactions was using datasets generated two different models

both experimental evidence prediction activity robust
when taken together results support our hypothesis derived points human relevant could used rational basis target selection despite model uncertainty
introduction
role mathematical modeling systems biology will play molecular development remains
suggested understanding critical questions biology required integration experimental computational research
et al others analysis dynamics human relevant networks using predictive computer models data would play important role research disease mechanisms
however structural uncertainty remains open modeling
strategies experimental computational techniques had at network structures
experimental computational techniques molecular interaction networks
central experimental area protein protein network identification been yeast system quantitative techniques determine protein
protein dna interactions using technique where likely transcription factor binding sites were determined using combination dna
correlation matrices genetic techniques network strategies also been used concentration measurements estimate reaction network structures
sensitivity analysis been used model identification optimal experimental design knowledge discovery
et al used sensitivity analysis study b where uncertainty was using sensitivity using parameter set family random parameter sets was generated where sensitivity were each random family
et al develop framework upon work et al et al functional interactions networks using stimulus response strategy metabolic control analysis
et al investigated problem growth continuous subject using model identification they determined optimal experimental design strategies identify between model
et al identified signal models measurements using estimate protein measurements measured values
they further proposed strategies experimental experimental information used identify signal models well strategy explore model structure
sensitivity analysis also been used explore robustness metabolic signaling networks
robustness ability system performance uncertainty feature both biological well networks systems
sensitivity small very could lead system following because few
et al several examples robustness biological networks while first predicted later experimentally robust features control networks
robustness models cell while et al identified points robustness using sensitivity analysis overall state sensitivity models
study use tools systems biology mathematical modeling sensitivity analysis explore hypothesis models human relevant despite model uncertainty points mechanisms mechanisms could rational basis target selection
test our hypothesis model developed literature sources
after model using datasets generated two different models use sensitivity analysis model mechanisms presence natural
then contrast predicted mechanisms literature determine if they consistent experimental our hypothesis
while current development strategy general could applied arbitrary network
family key group cells both directly relevant human health been suggested drug discovery
