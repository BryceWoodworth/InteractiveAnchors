cells via important regulatory process required many essential cellular functions
role interactions pathway cells remains
membrane together evolution address how formation membrane presence
our results identify unique role protein multiple play role addition role binding membrane
our results also suggest important role spatial
suggest there exists critical size above
based observed strong suggest due membrane cell type explain experimentally observed size typically range
our model also provides estimates number involved without any direct experimentally observed well their probability distributions well cell experiments
presented model several experimental observations process prior dependent
introduction
cellular process important biological regulation cells well drug
cells via important regulatory process required many essential cellular functions including communication
several experimental well theoretical mechanisms yet role interactions pathway cells remains
sequence molecular events protein 2 proteins etc protein membrane
proteins membrane
presence proteins results formation proteins both well
step
even though play important role process s cells at best small effect
focus
recent work membrane only presence
experiments performed expression well those involving either significantly number distribution involved formation
although cells remains complex regulatory process critical set experiments now models describe formation
even though models directly experimental context not been proposed et al yeast
moreover et al shown model two component response between two components membrane et al investigated effect protein domain formation biological
recent current experimental membrane also available
model our focus three proteins their role cell membrane
cells set proteins often mechanisms
our choice model proteins proteins proteins
recent experiments reported characteristics growth was observed occur but only within elements
cell domains appear
was observed only region following growth phase addition at rate about one every 2 s
two possible they either into they about suggests
while do not consider process growth based above observations study process one presence finite size membrane free elements subject condition at
our model cell membrane not value our derived literature
respect describe model membrane phase effective properties
our model also sense just one effect not
our model does not account mechanism
form interactions using free energy process
based data formation estimated relative
energy per bound domain 2 groups membrane binding energy per bound domain energy
interactions membrane require presence about 1 percent total cell membrane
produce d area required d 2 2
area per 2 number molecules membrane area 1 percent
hence note binding sites binding sites hence sufficient number corresponding binding sites present domain
not explicitly species our model
