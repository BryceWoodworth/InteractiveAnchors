evolutionary dynamics during phase response through drug treatment
understand model evolution parameters genetic selection need known
while mutation rates measured single relevant effective rate depends probability cell more than one only population data
however most population genetic rates assume selection hence limited since positive selection important evolution
yet little known about distribution selection between individual impact single
here estimate rate distribution selection time series sequence data evolution within single patients
temporal changes genetic population estimate effective per site
furthermore provide evidence selection at least percent observed percent per
results provide basis more detailed understanding evolution
particularly case evolution response drug treatment where multiple mutations
methods developed here more more detailed studies will possible data higher time greater sample available
introduction
human among most known system
after patients typically several years during present at low levels typically at formula formula per
number produced estimated formula per time less than two
due high mutation rate formula per site sequence within single formula percent within few years increases formula percent per although rate not constant
subject positive selection novel not system reduce sensitivity well selection functional constraints
addition high rates strong selection genomes different within same genetic information
form cell two more contain two rna different
next genomes generated while
been shown significantly genetic within
cases several give novel become part global
observation after change drug suggests might play important role evolution drug predicted theoretical models
amount up evolution drug depends parameters population dynamics many not known sufficient accuracy
estimates rate shown about formula times while genome resulting rate formula per site
however rate only secondary importance since generate only if contains two rna different requires cells
effective rate therefore rate probability single cell
effective rate been estimated based methods developed population
methods use single sample sequences obtained population estimate rate tree sequence sample
together estimate mutation rate allows estimate rate real time
et al report estimate formula per site almost cells
here present different method estimate rates sequence data been obtained patients at
comparing sequence samples time points estimate rates distance time probability between pairs sites
find effective rate formula per site
furthermore estimate selection rate at change
find about percent observed selected than formula percent per
