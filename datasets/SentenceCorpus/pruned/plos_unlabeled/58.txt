introduction
identification genetic mutations important discovery genetic complex
although wide variety methods available single discovery dna sequencing method choice studies
dna sequencing may either random strategy strategy using specific target regions interest
human genome genetic mutations wide variety human expected increase
direct sequencing genomic samples results sequencing
therefore one most discovery method sequencing give two similar true
most widely used discovery analysis
only when site shows about percent compared average individuals
however computational results human often required low positive rate process
provide accurate method detection developed new review process
report application three genetic variation studies compare its results those obtained human experimental
first study was used sequencing
second study novel regions human genome third study mutations
