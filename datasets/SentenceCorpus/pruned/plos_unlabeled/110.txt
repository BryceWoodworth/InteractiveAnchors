identify genes involved development number integration sites number expected due introduction techniques
data various available cancer gene database
presence common sites requires approach increased probability finding amount available data increases
moreover estimates should taking into account both noise random nature process well bias sites present genome data
introduce framework kernel framework find environment using level while error
where previous methods use one two three fixed scales our method at any relevant scale
analyze scale space new behavior across multiple scales
our method also features including models bias
using data evaluate framework using three kernel functions kernel function
applied data combined set found percent do not threshold combined setting
still under control application our method discovery novel each probability less than percent being
introduction
experiments genes involved development cancer identified
after cell its own dna into genome dna process
mutation may expression genes when within gene gene
when affected gene cancer gene activation gene cells
may give

when cell
result contains many cell but only few cells
when dna one will larger than do not
regions genome found multiple independent called common sites
result highly correlated genes involved development
sequences determine data find significant therefore discovery new cancer genes
