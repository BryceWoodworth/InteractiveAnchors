genetic properties neurons significantly influence their synaptic network structure common notion
provides approach question quantitative manner
its synaptic connectivity network been identified combined cellular studies connectivity gene expression most its neurons
using two analysis show expression significant information about its synaptic connectivity identify genes predicting neural connectivity
current study relation between gene expression synaptic connectivity c system neurons where relation highly
results presented genes identified provide point further more detailed computational experimental
introduction
common notion genes play major role formation they cell types help neurons into defined neural provide important cues their communication
many studies identified specific genes c development neural
genes typically development
findings include genes interactions input synaptic genes
findings been based specifically studies each designed address specific pathway type receptor
yet been difficult identify large scale mutations determine specific synaptic because synaptic one complex process
et al presented first genes involved c
study identified more than novel genes specific functions transmission signals across
while latter study was not at synaptic connectivity genes demonstrated questions manner
recent related study et al applied entropy approach c data identify sets genes whose expression common most predicts neural connectivity specific
our study both its its methods
leads first quantitative relation between genetic properties neurons their synaptic connectivity c neurons at large
existing c neural provides connectivity each other neurons
each also expression genes directly associated
combined together data relation between expression connectivity across most c neurons
specifically address two attributes first whether possible predict connectivity based its expression
second question what extent do neurons similar expression similar connectivity
show expression neurons significant information about their connectivity further identify specific genes play major role relation
gene sets identify do not direct influence synaptic connectivity however they provide gene targets further experimental
finally suggest way study between expression connectivity their actual functional behavior
allows classical question what neural local genetic basis individual neurons overall network structure determined their connectivity
