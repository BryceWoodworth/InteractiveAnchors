exact intrinsic structures
some studies suggest dna occur at certain values one another dna however studies literature
here investigate dna length distributions yeast genome using two novel analysis genomic experimentally hidden markov model applied experimentally defined
both methods dna yeast at dna
intrinsic structure average yeast
introduction
genomic dna exists complex called
first level dna 1 protein
short dna
most further into
despite much effort structure remains
here report analysis relative along dna new structure
dna itself
each base pair increase between two them along dna potentially change relative
however because per turn dna about dna second different space different intrinsic structure
interactions might intrinsic structure particular structure independent exact dna
case changes intrinsic structure would instead changes stability
because high dna short changes stability would
while one several intrinsic structure n do instead next n complete dna up where but along dna n
if dna about average value resulting intrinsic structure would random
but if dna instead were length dna would define structure detailed intrinsic structure highly depending phase d length d
there many literature however results
early analysis dna suggested yeast s occur while those human cells no
studies first did not but later did dna form
later correlation analyses variable results preferences form yeast human cells
existing studies us develop two new independent computational methods new experimental data define probability distribution dna yeast
our results both approaches show dna yeast indeed yeast genome structure its average
