perception because different object properties generate same information
information into estimates properties our prior knowledge additional information
example distance object its size
literature contains few use prior knowledge information combined visual almost no stimuli
previous studies reported humans multiple single continuous object properties like size position
here test whether humans use visual information size distance
presented participants
because no distance information available under participants rely prior assumptions about distance their size
distance information prior distance assumptions their size judgment accuracy though cues were more than
our results suggest both visual distance information size perception results context probabilistic
introduction
well over considered question how brain uses visual make judgments size effect its distance but remains
found when strong distance were made available human size matching performance at different was high but when distance were human perception size was its visual
et al literature hypothesis visual perception size distance their constant value hypothesis was subject variety
several studies size physical distance while others point out specific experimental design choices task reported size
recently reported size when relative distance between object due motion than when due object motion
findings state current empirical knowledge about human size distance perception theoretical account perception
brain makes size multiple based knowledge their relationship physical environment properties like biases due observed
our experiments issue how brain distance information particular how size
perception not been studied perception literature close similarity size perception because judgments based image size if information about unknown
however when available may rule out whether object
predicted despite stimuli whether object would depend quality information about its
because provide information about predicted they would each judgments
thus our study two key does brain use information perception
what information
our task presented participants object either while either asked them whether
most size perception tasks use matching our task was because us present single stimulus per relative comparison pairs stimuli
provided participants different types information both examined their judgments evaluate how distance information perceived
evidence use distance information perception not been reported previous studies cue integration suggest brain information its improve spatial perception
found when information was judgments image
however when provided participants participants additional information form more accurate size were consistent both
moreover when both information was presented most participants showed greater size than when either was presented
results suggest perception uses knowledge how size distance related
findings framework probabilistic inference available combined according their relationship properties their
