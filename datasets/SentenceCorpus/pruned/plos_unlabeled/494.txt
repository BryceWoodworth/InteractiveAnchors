introduction
wide variation genome was dna analyses
because gene differences genome there were likely differences gene species
current complete genome sequences now possible genes present well those genome
among genomes gene sets over genes almost genes
wide variation genome gene also observed between within individual species
example more than percent their sequences value species differ many genes their genome
even among similar genome there differences gene
only about 1 percent genes genome unique order gene genomes change over relatively short evolutionary
novel gene processes gene gene loss
although several mechanisms generate new genes novel gene sets observed related result gene sources gene only produce unique genes short gene sets
although many genes other most also contain sets genes lack any known
genomes gene gene loss occurs both through well smaller changes individual genes
observed sequences also contain sets genes up percent their genes
taken together gene need genome dynamics manner genes over short evolutionary
end related e shown gene at recently genes more
however few studies examined genes within asked how many classes genes genome
address questions differences gene among e
related yet differences genome size gene us introduction genes leading genomes
