populations within single major difficulty natural response well design drug
recently developed sequencing used sequencing samples
present computational methods analysis sequence data apply techniques data obtained populations within patients
our main result estimation population structure sample
inference based statistical approach error algorithm set explain data
using set apply statistical model population via maximization algorithm
demonstrate allow effective population simulations comparison sequences obtained directly sequencing four independent populations
thus used estimation structure populations new into evolutionary dynamics disease control strategies
introduction
novel experimental technique sequence dna genome
method less than existing but also significantly more than those obtained sequencing
paper address computational sequencing rna sample
rna populations different related
population exhibit high degree genetic often concept described
genetic key factor disease design drug
sequencing samples approach population structure
population many each one but unknown population
thus central problem data set possible consistent observed structure population relative frequency each
here present computational procedure making inference about population based set
first reference genome
second sequencing errors along multiple alignment using clustering techniques
next consistent observed
problem search set graph show how search problem very
finally introduce statistical model sequencing process maximum likelihood principle frequency each population
alignment step proposed procedure data here been discussed
due presence reference genome only alignment necessary between each reference genome
will therefore focus core methods error frequency estimation
two independent approaches proposed method
first present simulation results all method
second procedure four independent populations comparing populations results sequencing same samples
datasets average length 1 region gene samples populations
produce up single
part our analysis interaction between number sequencing error rate theoretical
methods developed paper scale datasets under assumptions
however sample size than what typically obtained using sequencing
since many samples data about populations one
population structure set general computational problem because number possible
error frequency estimation problem into three smaller more tasks each also interest its own
presented methods not rna populations but apply reference genome available sufficient genetic distance between large
data variation gene about percent single
find populations more they become
even at percent find much population using our methods
gene been only one specific seems occur complex occurs under
our samples were did not
therefore assume there no true population
however algorithms developed paper manner case true
problem population structure sequence similar highly genome
however rather than one genome population very similar genomes
problem also related environmental sequencing genomes all species
while associated computational biology problems related those appear other novel approaches required short complex structure populations
problem also similar problem main difference being number unknown alternative
more generally problem population genome sequence samples been studied populations
example been used estimate sequencing data
using been sequence
our methods differ previous work show how analyze highly sequencing data using mathematical statistical framework
