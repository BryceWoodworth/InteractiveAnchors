when outcome errors used correct model systems
here examine changes model system under changes structure errors overall bias
introduced change statistical distribution errors while were based outcomes
derive predictions each its model system
find humans overall change error but error distribution
through comparison found model error distribution
were manner error despite continuous information distribution actual errors
introduction
system
ability sense between one learning
here nature error signal used future when result does not outcome
there number statistics error signal might use future average recent errors n distribution past errors
what statistics system
previous work focused bias where responses found direction previous errors prior error
work learning models future would produced previous error
model learning suggests errors past future
models at least who used type model describe following
however models simply error signals produce outcomes
relationships between signal error between outcome must those far certain
current research examined role uncertainty learning
example et al stochastic average field found subjects field its over recent errors
here response changes uncertainty whether responses result model if so aspects structure error signal
studies increased noise response known occur when presence motion
were shown motion motion stimulus random order
motion if present at direction visual motion
subjects could not any particular condition since were could they online because were before feedback was possible
because following response only component was possible test aspects new distribution errors was
test changes representation noise changes targets depend information available uncertainty
experiments targets subjects instead region loss
two each targets without subjects learn their natural noise distributions then pairs later us their representation uncertainty
our results model even when distribution actual errors
result consistent recent results independent errors because system only representation errors system only those errors their
