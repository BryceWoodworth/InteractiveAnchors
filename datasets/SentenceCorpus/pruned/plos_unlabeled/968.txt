goal human genome accurate genome
recently there been development many even more expected appear
differ each other
important goal reduce cost point consider
here simulation will help us different genome especially large structural
considered most step human genome
end problems small scale
using simulations show how different solve at low cost
our simulations structure human genome computational complexity practical algorithms
they show how different more than using one length how optimal sequencing strategy large novel usually also accurate detection how improve how more efficient than just sequencing some complex
our strategy should sequencing human genomes at maximum accuracy low cost
introduction
human genome two pairs
between individuals single relatively large structural larger many more smaller variation among individuals
most large due genomic few others contain novel sequences not present reference genome
goal determine all genetic differences between individuals understand how differences individuals
making almost over past development high sequencing sequencing individual genomes
et al reported sequencing genome based sequencing strategies
et al presented another genome sequence sequencing comparative genome methods
mean time other new sequencing sequencing become available individual genome sequencing corresponding sequence algorithm designed
algorithms however single sequencing perform individual thus did not take full advantage all existing experimental
1 characteristics several comparative individual genome sequencing
at one long sequencing very will lead results at high cost
another only short sequencing may generate good results detection but will not able either some genomic regions many large
moreover at different also identify directly able number into analysis
thus consider all experimental techniques into individual genome framework design experiment computational algorithms
due existence reference genome high similarity between genome reference identification small relatively comparative analysis single small
although there exist algorithms large complete large requires integration wide region often involving other genome
if there were no human genome large would high short regions
existence human genome however set will required some regions strategy both comparative approaches will necessary identify genomic events also large novel individuals
thus much than others will main focus paper
here present some case studies how different experimental individual genome especially large so achieve accurate sequencing
optimal experimental design should combination long short sequencing also some
some previous genome sequencing approaches using both long although general problem optimal experimental design not yet been studied
while show potential based different integration strategies
also since will useful general approach predict outcome different including new ones future
following will first describe comparative genome framework most large then use set simulations experimental design
since full simulations large parameter space different simulations out framework real genomic data sequencing process
also simulation framework new well parameters existing ones provide optimal strategies characteristics when them more important
simulation framework general optimal
