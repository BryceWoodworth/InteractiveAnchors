many important protein protein interactions binding short one protein large another
recent provided examples new binding proteins structure available but where no structure protein complex known
address present approach predict binding sites protein
known particular protein method predicts binding sites accuracy approach means also used predict whether not predicted will
used known protein derive preferences form spatial position specific matrices describe environment proteins each type amino bound
then binding protein sites each amino present search amino sites constraints sequence
method performed well experimental data binding sites several recently interactions including proteins domains domains domain
method associated statistics predicting binding sites critical events biology
introduction
protein protein interactions all cellular processes including signaling dna
interactions how they
what most often interactions involving large those however many important protein interactions particularly those related events like binding domain one protein short another
often disordered including many disordered interaction thus explain many functional regions
regions binding common protein domain often sequence pattern linear key features binding
instance domains motifs domains motifs domains
since they generally more than interactions involving larger protein interactions also represent important new class drug targets there number small molecules designed target them
discovery new motifs interactions been interest recent years
several techniques been developed new known
instance been applied new many proteins domains including domains
several computational approaches also been developed use protein known structure find additional likely recently probabilistic interaction networks been used predict regions corresponding kinase
common all approaches they rely prior knowledge type binding domain often require further knowledge binding site protein
they thus generally only effective finding new known cannot directly new protein interaction types
protein protein only widely used technique applied problem generally however approach limited application than residues high degree one must consider when residues need known only available
moreover methods very conformational changes require very structures perform well
new protein interaction types experimentally because difficult know regions larger proteins binding experiments binding
address several computational methods been developed new protein pairs using principle sequence proteins common
methods together much work focused understanding interactions identified predicted new interactions particular protein domain
however provide information about where protein
suggest further experiments help design interaction
structures protein all interactions will require time become available though increase structural data single proteins means very often structures available at least part protein
there thus between proteins known structure known predicted particular available would understanding mechanism discovery additional
here present method predicting binding site protein
used protein known structure protein data define spatial position specific matrices preferences how each amino protein
three position specific matrices been used past predict protein quality structural models predict function proteins based position specific matrices new protein structure identify protein
however best our knowledge they not been used predict interactions way
new protein pair identify binding sites predicted sites each protein according distance constraints
developed statistics determine confidence prediction estimate whether not
when applied obtained sensitivity us apply approach several new interactions interaction membrane protein 1 factor receptor domain protein binding sites further
