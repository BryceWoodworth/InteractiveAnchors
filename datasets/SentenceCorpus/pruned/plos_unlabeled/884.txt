evolution world us
at core every evolutionary process population individuals
outcome evolutionary process depends population structure
here provide general formula evolutionary dynamics wide class populations
class recently introduced games space evolutionary set theory
there local interactions relative individuals but require global means all individuals
study two strategies context evolutionary game determine strategy limit selection
derive formula structure provide method efficient numerical
introduction
constant selection individuals does not depend population
general however individuals affected what others
then game theory evolutionary game theory
latter study frequency dependent individuals typically assumed linear function strategies population
population dynamic changes population over
there also close relationship between evolutionary game theory species depends its own other species
classical approach evolutionary game dynamics based large populations
population any two individuals likely
some recent approaches consider stochastic evolutionary dynamics populations finite size
evolutionary game dynamics also affected population structure
example population typically evolution while population
there also long spatial models population theory
evolutionary graph theory spatial games studied general graphs
graph who physical structure social networks
payoff individuals derived local interactions their graph
moreover individuals their
two processes also described graphs
games space represent another type spatial model evolutionary dynamics idea based
addition behavioral strategies individuals other features identification
one version model individuals only those who same
approach lead clustering space evolution
evolutionary set theory another type spatial model
each individual several sets
at particular time some sets many while others
individuals others same set derive payoff
individuals their set strategies global comparison others
strategies sets more
therefore population structure described graph
evolutionary dynamics set populations over
all three evolutionary graph theory games space evolutionary set theory individuals local interactions
evolutionary graph theory there also local individuals learn their graph individuals
evolutionary set theory however global individuals learn all others population their strategies set
global also feature model games space
approach presented paper requires global
therefore our result evolutionary set theory games space but does not apply evolutionary graph theory
