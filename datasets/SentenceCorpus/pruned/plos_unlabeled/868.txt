theory was means between various mathematical structures
use theory show inference class involve mathematical structures called
other tasks similar including matrix theory also involve structures
contrast not involved tasks within their ability
results point fundamental cognitive principle under development during sense
introduction
various over similar development
inference class two among similar all years
example if than than then than
form called inference
also understand will contain more than
number items greater than number items any one its
form called class
two types inference appear little common
inference typically involves physical relationships between objects while class involves relative object classes
tests other range groups revealed was about years
since research revealed important development inference yet little known about underlying
common two recent information
complexity theory between cognitive based maximum must
cognitive complexity control theory based common relation
although approach cognitive basis certain assumptions must made about analysis
tasks procedure inference class difficult see how analysis one task leads other
complexity theory inference considered involve integration two binary between task elements into whereas class integration three binary between three sets elements into relation
cognitive complexity control theory inference involves over whereas class involves over sets items
theoretical difficulty general problem cognitive where basic components unknown
detailed knowledge cognitive been assume particular
approach however does not itself current problem because elements inference class tasks do not common basis
then studied detailed general
theory was out between various mathematical structures since been applied analysis computational structures computer
was objects primary focus analysis their
contrast instance sets defined terms objects they contain set theory against sets defined terms them theory
our approach analysis inference our way current
cognitive several authors used theory analysis space time though know only one other application empirical data
since our application theory cognitive novel first introduce basic theory needed our analysis inference class other
analysis introduction data our approach explain between relative across
finally our approach more complex levels inference
our main point despite lack all tasks via defined below
result new approach general particularly development less likely revealed standard modeling methods
