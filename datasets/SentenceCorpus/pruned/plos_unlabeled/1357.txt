widely cellular function structure molecular networks
common view network group nodes network
many algorithms identify functional networks groups proteins
here present alternative approach independent any prior what actually
manner proteins into functional if they similar ways other proteins according their functional
may well result but only if network structure actually
applied our method human protein reference database found representation network terms at least global scale does not represent structure because finding independent groups proteins
contrast into functional able structure much better also into account between even allows based interactions between proteins same functional role
example case proteins could group nodes
when experimental methods groups identified differences our method able experimental bias data too
example data were highly one particular group
thus there more structure networks than finding significantly improve function prediction algorithms
introduction
biological function
genes make proteins proteins form cells cells form form organisms organisms form populations populations form
while higher levels well genetic been one
development experimental techniques interactions well data make data available key towards understanding function cellular network
data now allow functional within networks computational approaches protein function
recent review et al current methods network based prediction methods protein function
proteins must function
hence protein function protein interaction network
basic underlying assumption all methods functional interaction strong common function
et al two basic approaches network based function direct methods seen local methods principle second network methods first network into according some then proteins based known other proteins
so instead one could
latter approach function prediction concept what considered network
most researchers consider sets proteins highly but only network
methods at level very small scale particular protein
concept group proteins also useful larger scales
some researchers sense universal principle small form larger
but view describe protein interactions
recently whether clusters protein interaction networks biological information at all suggested simple network growth model based gene would produce observed structural evolutionary without biological
will not far biological information network structure but rather argue against model group nodes network functional all scales network
consider first example protein
indeed they proteins together experimentally together
only large scale analysis protein revealed they more dynamic than previously assumed
many proteins not only found single but
information about proteins will when only groups proteins
second example consider proteins like signal
they tend many different proteins well their
still only do different each other
thus functional class will not identified when
here whether features not algorithms also present overall structure cellular network
if case methods only would not able identify them
group proteins into functional if they similar ways other proteins according their functional
role may well proteins class other proteins class but does not
other words do not structure network our analysis but rather find structural representation best data
using functional role generate image graph original network only interactions among classes proteins thus view network
case protein interaction network studied here found evidence global scale do not represent global structure
found groups proteins specifically other groups proteins
furthermore even identified groups proteins only within themselves but similar patterns interaction other proteins
thus approaches only network might not sufficient represent all characteristics cellular networks
our findings suggest groups proteins universal principle
cases does clustering network into not its original
consider network 1 there four known types proteins network
type formula may some biological process involving proteins four proteins type formula
another biological process formula involves further proteins finally four proteins type formula
not all nodes same type same set
some nodes same type do not any common nodes their type more common nodes different type
shows example direct methods functional may limited their accuracy
clustering network into cannot full structure network
nodes type b will because they not at all
structure example network however simple image graph nodes
nodes image graph types nodes network
nodes type formula other nodes type formula nodes type formula
nodes type formula nodes types formula formula so
concept types nodes their relation other types nodes known social
structure recognition networks then seen finding best image graph network
context clustering into functional means network image graph nodes
nodes into classes obtained matrix corresponding nodes same class
nodes same class random
leads structure matrix corresponding image graph sparse corresponding image graph
structure recognition networks therefore also called modeling together structural long history social
our further will image graphs only nodes 1 b image graphs due structure along matrix they
will call all other image graphs image graphs
