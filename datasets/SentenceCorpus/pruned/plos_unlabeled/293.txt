introduction
usually physiological condition increase
since phenomenon natural selection might expected its life history organisms
its natural world therefore been evolutionary theory
there general principle been understanding nature been one evolutionary
evolution one two based either classical population physiological
first mutations genes expression
more generally genes mutations early life at cost some effect later
key perspective selection component genetic so cost more strongly selected against than cost more than cost
organisms expected natural selection
population genetic analysis been recently both
first selection only mutations effects been suggested mutations effects selection need not may more relevant
second what extent what way life will natural selection depends what variation available
thus more genes there more evolutionary there will life
however despite much empirical work over several evidence genes necessary effects
contrast classical population genetic approach theory based within physiological
thus result action physiological processes optimal available between growth
particular there cost cost form only later life
relevant genetic mutations must effects at physiological level
potentially much more though more strongly current evidence
given between early generally been
particular long been considered because
yet understanding evolution account organisms even negative
species remains constant increases
they include some organisms at well over both clusters at least
other examples recently perspective problem was explain evolution
given nature its presence seems very organisms
rather important issue now provide evolutionary account those organisms appear exhibit little no but almost did exhibit
theoretical analysis shown although often high early strategies optimal if loss presence would fast
optimization model shown how negative species body size their if growth increasing output
both analyses optimal between so within
analyses not density case population growth set
paper construct models within very general class organisms including those without growth
density sufficient evolution life
sets up direction evolution either life
thus one hand future less than present given future risk
other hand future may more its than its own present if risk before
make who showed positive growth also whereas requires
our his analysis show how take form selection even intrinsic
indeed widely condition regulation
show either represent only population growth because its nature its significant evolution
here perform optimization analysis evolution between into life into later life context evidence
populations at demonstrate conditions under natural selection itself increases losses genomic increasing level within population
density means into population therefore natural selection length over
positive feedback leads novel result density regulation selection
develop model shows potential selection reduced across wide range including loss early constant
find natural selection evolution even presence without special characteristics increasing intrinsic

section 1 assumptions make about action
section 2 relation between use
our approach define terms rates rather than rate change value
section mutations our assumptions effects mutations key parameter rate states our main result evolution highly life history highly life history
