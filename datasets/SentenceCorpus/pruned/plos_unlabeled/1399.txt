complex relationships between spatial regulation genome function been previously described

alternative approaches based between elements been developed
between small number elements like two pairs were used testing spatial
spatial statistics tools distance functions been developed spatial point patterns been applied studies

all been used analyze spatial distribution
spatial statistics data usually through sampling over single point process
point process generally considered
theoretical framework makes sense applications investigated phenomenon far observed region
contrast analyses spatial patterns based whole domain interest observed
furthermore one should not consider observed patterns point processes
another difference data available analysis out sample
recently distance functions been extended point patterns
instance extended been used spatial patterns brain
extended into account expected spatial point process
estimate patterns first all observed points common system
however type not possible due lack
hence further required make spatial statistics tools appropriate spatial studies
study develop approach analysis spatial
spatial distributions were using distribution functions between arbitrary points within their
analysis g was designed specifically patterns observed variable domains
applied new approach distribution populations
was chosen due its structural regulatory functions
indeed usually transcription essential genome genetic information during cell
often clusters
studied cells at various three biological at cells during cells
found random significantly more patterns than expected under complete cell populations existence rules possible
