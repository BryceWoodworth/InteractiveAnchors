further test use our inference approach predict mutations
introduce mutations into its gene experimentally demonstrate some mutations allow at higher
our work therefore new approach predicting mutations applied even large complex proteins
approach also makes mathematical between experimentally protein properties potentially way more accurate analyses molecular evolution
introduction
knowledge impact individual amino mutations stability both understanding natural evolution its properties
experimentally effects mutations protein stability process so variety methods been predict effects
most existing methods rely some type modeling mutation context structure often information statistical analyses protein sequences structures
types methods accurate at predicting effects mutations small proteins
there little no data their performance larger more complex proteins biological interest although might expected given greater difficulty modeling larger structures
alternative approach predicting effects mutations protein stability information related sequences
approach was introduced alignment related sequences random sample all possible sequences into given protein structure
based statistical frequency given sequence alignment assumed function its stability
often called approach since always predicts most mutation will most
approach wide range studies basic notion residues tend appear more sequence proteins
but although often effective approach natural proteins do not represent random samples all possible sequences given structure but instead highly evolutionary relationships
particular might occur because through independent amino might occur simply because common many related sequences alignment
sequence evolution even related protein so problem will all natural sequence
therefore would information about protein stability sequence using method evolutionary relationships
fact there highly developed mathematical protein sequences
widely used methods protein models amino likelihood
however methods make no effort determine how selection protein stability might itself amino alignment sequences
instead their form methods simply assume there universal average tendency one particular amino another
more methods allow different average different classes protein residues
still other methods use simulations other methods derive matrices different protein
however methods probabilities effects mutations experimentally properties protein stability do they provide method predicting effects mutations protein
here present approach using protein effects amino mutations protein stability
framework effect protein stability probability will fixed evolution
then show how framework used likelihood specific relationships given stability effects all possible amino mutations protein
our actual goal do stability effects given known protein
use bayesian inference derived modeling program
compare stability effects experimental values several proteins show our method both modeling program approach
finally use our method predict mutations increase complex mutations previously been predicted any approach
introduce predicted mutations into experimentally demonstrate several them increase protein context
overall our work framework protein stability into analyses well new approach predicting mutations
