how affected features population environment only recently under
stochastic transmission model was analyze environmental processes through one person another via different transmission explore factors increase different transmission
each its own high transmission other
transmission was highly parameter values
example transmission usually required high density while contact had no
depending specific context one more may sufficient high transmission while other no transmission may result
because when making decisions involve environmental pathways applied may instead choice should depending specific features people question
introduction
who
health were their transmission within their
while increased their
were cases
interest control multiple potential transmission during later
potential another increased study well increased modeling transmission
studies were order better understand optimal control strategies
much was into strategies social
however little known about relative different transmission how might due environment
potential effects unknown factors transmission model structure explicitly environmental processes through one person another different approach factors increase different transmission under given model structure
model environmental transmission system model approach models et al model event framework various processes involved
does not define contact events transmission probabilities each event most transmission models do
problem approach what contact
instead define events related environmental
allows us address events at level more relevant possible more theory
relevant options consider four potential contact transmission
consider each follows
transmission occurs when small region lower
transmission occurs when size
transmission occurs when large individual directly
contact transmission occurs when person their own via their via large
may then result others who then may their potentially
how different model parameters influence how much transmission follows different
example different may different
among different populations who different behaviors same may different effects depending type population present
finally even human populations environmental may variable area patterns generate different population level outcomes
sources address form
effects sources relative transmission where all individuals
construct detailed stochastic individual based model environmental transmission
use values empirical literature well judgment model
apply lower parameter constraints parameters obtain sample parameter space
analyze resulting outcome space respect how different transmission more less important specific
work body literature transmission
work step previous environmental transmission models model all four transmission do so agent based framework rather than based model empirical work no model optimization were used model
explicitly point out where empirical literature exist
show depending one may more less important than another
therefore when applied may instead choice should depending specific features people question
consider how features related behavior environment transmission via each
