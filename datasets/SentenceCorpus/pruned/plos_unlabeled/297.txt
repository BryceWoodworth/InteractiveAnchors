when into all other amino residues two important
values close
mutations result introduction significantly affect protein stability
present work describe procedure predict effect introduction protein stability
amino residues model protein were activity each was characterized
decision tree mutation was properties activity data
properties including main main were determined models proteins using
performance decision tree large mutations other literature
overall accuracy algorithm was found percent case percent case percent case percent case other data
accuracy secondary structure was also found at best percent
our prediction procedure will useful proteins protein design
introduction
unique among amino residues
one hand because main n
hence involved main could protein
property previously been obtain information about residues involved secondary structure
other hand main range values close
also been observed protein sequence
large area between
regions
there also small density region unique residues
hence potentially increase protein stability because conformational entropy state
addition usually conserved proteins often important role protein structure function
previous studies different proteins shown effects depend various factors including position value original group original interactions original
however not yet clear whether introduction at given position protein will effect stability protein
aim present work generate algorithm based data used predict effect at given position any protein
also examine utility protein secondary structure
experimental system used study cell b protein protein
protein does not contain any
protein dna
normal cells gene results cell
if protein through mutation cells genes will
work each amino using high based
total could generated
was function expression level presence cell growth function concentration
based analysis data its correlation various structural parameters decision tree was protein into mutations
decision tree was further large at two different single database associated various database literature
