introduction
comparative genomic provides estimate relative genomic dna taken reference organisms represent sequences reference
method been used number biological applications including detection human human comparative
algorithms been applied analysis data
reference sequences into two sequences present sequences
observed data each case assumed classes
describe apply method analysis data genome
method spatial information about reference genome hidden markov model
spatial information expected biological evolutionary information structure regions gene
our approach previously proposed methods applied consider each reference measurements independent their genomic thus more similar methods predicted structure into expression data set organisms
compare relative performance our method used analysis algorithms
demonstrate several assumptions common analysis methods relationship between observed presence reference do not always strongly particularly case more organisms
our data particular do not support between present classes sequence but rather between those sequences reference do those do not genome
find better predictor reference sequences do not than other methods tested
spatial sequences reference genome previously been into methods applied analyses number variation human genomes
been represented using methods
simple methods also been used identify data
however problem domain human number problem domain comparative genomic
best our knowledge study first application method spatial information comparative first technique whole across

common
despite their many significant differ their range distribution environmental
molecular differences not well but likely dynamic genome core components
there two available genomes
sequences our understanding organisms but expected greater into evolution function
major common factors cell cell
other factors include systems
contrast
associated interaction
mechanisms type system into cells
biochemical responses wide strategies
however other also other gene associated interaction more complex relationship their than simple
key factors role include type type systems gene
other factors associated adaptation environment been identified genes associated formation
many genes associated other associated gene
gene often variable between species genome order core genome provides essential all related organisms
observed differences between gene will differences their their distinct environments differences will genes their genomes
use apply our analysis method identify genomic do not
study sequences predicted interest because they may potentially including interactions
between three organisms range evolutionary since their most recent common represent variation at species levels
our results support hypothesis genomes genomic model genome at least part genomic
identify major differences within genomes while previous observations major genomic made using alternative approaches also find number differences provide into may play direct role variation terms their environmental range
