protein identification using computational life
increase use strategies understand biology systems need more effective efficient accurate computational methods protein identification
wide range computational methods each various available different approaches
knowledge range algorithms available more accuracy techniques essential many proteins possible within any particular experiment identified
here review available methods algorithms biological data associated protein identification
computational solutions they corresponding
evolution algorithms protein identification also discussed focus relative performance different techniques
also consider relative different techniques particular biological
finally present our perspective future area computational protein identification most recent literature new approaches problem well yet potential application methods other computational biology
introduction
relatively new but within life research understanding biology via study proteins expressed
there body literature many different biochemical interest study development treatment wide range
protein identification key essential step field
patterns protein expression lead important including example classification samples basis particular pattern
however without proteins known involved system under not possible into biological patterns develop underlying biology system interest
thus while protein identification may often taken remains key initial step biology its protein expression
our ability life research often dependent our ability identify full proteins found our samples interest
growth dna sequence protein similar growth machine critical nature protein identification process seen interest protein identification
example both number protein identification seen growth past
primary protein identification
while was first used almost use biological applications its use identification
accuracy sample weight range seen many recent making one
no than been their work
accuracy make them applications required not just but also many other life resulting data
when consider use protein identification lead number analysis algorithms data
often important number research
computational especially often expected data understanding most methods available true protein their particular application
into protein identification algorithms important because often results may biases chosen make problem affect result
despite protein identification several studies involving range datasets identification algorithms shown each case than proteins complex sample identified
given critical role protein identification analysis review explore limit current protein identification algorithms give relevant information practical computational life so best possible protein
