describe theory demonstrate its utility experimental visual system
introduction
understand function systems essential between individual neurons
major between within many brain been through studies but only existence not their dynamics
dynamics between two neurons requires physiological experiments activity both neurons measured
most direct experiments involves allow between two neurons directly investigated
however difficult perform obtain more than few cells at time
instead most physiological studies connectivity rely
experiments not usually possible explicitly connectivity directly
instead dynamics functional connectivity must through statistical methods
method dynamics between two neurons correlation function measures linear correlation between two signals over range
while c its been used number studies must considered when between neurons
c fact measure total between two signals thus all between them due their
case neurons there fact many potential sources stimuli intrinsic cellular network properties etc c cannot those due actual
several c been proposed address
example if activity response trials same stimulus available analysis often case early systems used some due stimulus
further c also been proposed due activity activity
while approaches upon standard c due those other sources remains general problem
addition methods there several other approaches between two signals used study between two neurons
methods generally into two
most common approach
one signal predicted two different using model based its own past using model based its own past past second signal
given difference predictive power two models dynamics regression parameters influence second signal
power approaches dependent validity underlying if between two signals linear then provided will accurate but situations where properties complex unknown often case neurons approach may more appropriate
most common approach entropy
measures reduction entropy one signal its own past past second signal relative reduction entropy its own past
overall but not its dynamics
paper new approach both dynamics out temporal both signals before at different
approach some common studies connectivity potential statistical between neurons those other sources provided appropriate
following theory our measure call information its activity experimental visual system consider its relationship other common measures
