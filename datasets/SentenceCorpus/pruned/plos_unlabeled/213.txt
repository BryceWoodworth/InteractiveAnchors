introduction
evolutionary game theory predicts natural selection strong existing evidence more than theory predicts
when terms solution dynamics populations
become however individuals few others along sparse graphs recently two independent studies
both studies place individuals nodes graph their social nodes evolution every individual strategy but not social
been shown under strong selection graphs lead significant increase overall terms most popular social networks different
classical involves cost c resulting b simple relation been obtained single population selection where average number each individual
both studies show games graphs open how social
however recent data shows networks exhibit average connectivity values 2 associated between connectivity values typically used previous studies
instance network average connectivity whereas networks based average values up
terms simple rule evolution graphs reported values require often more than one order single
previous results strong selection graphs how social networks
other mechanisms at work here allow
most evolutionary models developed so far social interactions fixed
social associated graphs individuals no control over number frequency their they only their strategy
similar observation made studies related physical properties complex networks
networks but one networks been typically produced some growth process
yet networks before will after been taken
indeed recent studies social networks global properties rather stable whereas individual patterns social time
hence fixed population size global average connectivity one may what role do changes interaction framework play evolution extent will social influence network
using model strategy evolution evolution individual cognitive very small investigate under conditions may
network now result dynamics will shown play role
let us consider two types individuals who several most popular social
they not required information all other only those they
moreover they able all those they those they change
given individuals b at if strategy b being
if will
if then may b being random b simple agents being rational individuals limited information tend other agents close social manner
sense agent more likely one b become
moreover may turn out good choice since also making more likely results
indeed all social described below any individual its strategy
all individuals
hence good choice individuals local information only
social examined work terms games where either upon interaction
when both they payoff other hand when both they both obtain payoff p two occur when one other resulting payoff t s
depending relative four payoff values over three social game game
follows payoff preferences
game since they
game resulting intrinsic
finally both combined game making most difficult situation
difference between 1 making 1 p
investigate all 1 parameter space 2 where payoff t t 2 payoff s 1 s 1
each individual total payoff resulting interactions all
fact our model via social they both upon between individual strategy population game payoff now strategy structure
adaptive individual new time scale not time scale associated strategy evolution
depending e different may occur
indeed results
other hand increasing individuals become their increasing
general however one two time scales situations
provides measure their rational choices both at strategy large values populations individuals whereas smaller values some overall change
general type response will change individual individual
hence here average population
