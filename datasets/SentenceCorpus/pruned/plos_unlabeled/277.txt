theoretical model based response network been previously proposed response changes concentration was observed but not
model reactions involving molecular species among were through complex set reactions
paper analyze previous model using combination mathematical tools out key components network explain how they response
find behavior due under one pathway while other pathway genes under
technique potentially useful larger networks
introduction
molecular
number metabolic changes cell
energy gene expression energy cellular allow energy despite
molecular interaction response network been proposed basis conserved components between
key network factor gene expression
transcription factor one three different common also known
system also directly sense level
very likely species also involved necessary 2
there three
then protein
response genes expression levels genes
1 input output core network
network characterized behavior increase when below critical value increase
was observed experimentally many cell including cells cells increases concentration
past two seen body work use mathematical modeling help both general molecular networks provide quantitative particular network may one sufficient predictive power model large cell
sense et al response characteristics system involving molecular species related
large model however does not identify smaller components actually response may occur other networks
furthermore numerical solution does not provide type mathematical
at same time solve type model reactions
context methods both reduce system its key components not numerical solution
pathway analysis one recently developed method
method dynamics interactions between species network state gene represented either not
genes through appropriate constant
network then matrix interaction rules then help key components their dynamic behavior
theory matrices then allows us vectors matrix ways further analysis
technique particular vectors space solutions
note similar methods analysis analysis been developed other
they same results been
methods provide way out complexity molecular networks
our type matrix approach provide detailed quantitative analysis observed behavior models
pathway identification via depends network detailed well numerical analysis model allows studies phase space unknown rate
specifically first used our approach original network into several underlying pathways
following make some solution
show solution case network behavior
comparing numerical output model numerical output complete model
second paper particular mechanism pathway effect response concentration
particular examine among pathways function concentration
also identify key molecular species involved network show how response overall response thus
our analysis suggests cycle efficient main role response
