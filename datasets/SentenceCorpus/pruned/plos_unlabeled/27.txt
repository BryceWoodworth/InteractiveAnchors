changes synaptic between neurons play role memory formation
important mechanism synaptic through regulatory proteins
several biochemical events control
here use computer models explore how changes long after initial synaptic molecules
base our models biochemical data experiments receptor kinase
find both molecules distinct
effective long despite molecular biochemical small numbers molecules
novel process where presence sufficient biases receptor cycle still more into
kinase
may function manner relatively
latter case leads multiple stable states
propose similar may important levels many molecules may lead possible stable states systems like
introduction
information occur through synaptic
many mechanisms been identified changes synaptic including changes changes numbers active structural
among into membrane receptor key events synaptic
fundamental issue all how they
synaptic at least three
major molecules few few may further synaptic activity
one solution loss memory due molecular concept molecular
typically involve some form molecular feedback systems into one two states
systems information binary manner
provided there molecules molecular since molecules become current state system
some current synaptic include type kinase hypothesis protein kinase feedback recently target protein
model been most most complete structural
according model at leads activation kinase
kinase molecules yet more molecules resulting cycle
feedback model also involves cycle but case several molecules
protein model based observation local protein associated
rna several proteins including themselves also present
thus high local protein high levels
protein
second mechanism synaptic memory synaptic proteins leading specific states
free suggest between synaptic likely under s even proteins
density complex provides synaptic proteins close region
problem free active molecules but problem molecules into correct
there evidence molecules
one cycle into synaptic membrane
important example receptor into active full
synaptic membrane involves two pathway involving receptor 2 pathway involving
based current evidence into synaptic membrane
there also evidence being synaptic
also upon binding
thus addition their known synaptic mechanisms manner processes
combination attributes makes molecules molecular memory mechanisms
over long term even events additional processes must considered stability
third important stable memory formation biochemical
uncertainty outcome biochemical reactions involving small numbers molecules
at where many important molecules present low numbers less than molecules
synaptic there estimated free 2
under stochastic conditions there finite probability state molecular
stable states depends both reaction rates number molecules
example proposed does not well synaptic state time scale
time estimates highly dependent assumptions about levels noise other synaptic pathways
together synaptic memory mechanism might like molecular molecules state even when small synaptic numbers taken into account
study report novel receptor based its
also examine possible context
finally explore how multiple synaptic states may
