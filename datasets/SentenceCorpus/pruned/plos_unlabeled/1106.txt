introduction
study biological systems visual processing provides systems systems turn important new
results been addition important theoretical empirical models among systems practical tests object recognition
however while provided some properties visual system much still unknown
even those properties most models experimental data provide little their key parameters
result even most models represent just one many possible computational
set computational difficult since performance model depends strongly its particular size number per etc because number parameters typically large computational cost one particular model high difficult explore space possible model
at same time there no even correct set will work when small scale
thus when model approach biological visual systems cannot if because they simply not together large scale
result factors computational critical role what computational possible
bound according however recently processing some classes computational problems
particular new class processing over some key most visual models common
other large quantitative performance new class potential effect changes how
present work take advantage recent processing more explore range models including models larger more scale
approaches molecular biology generated potential network parameter visual produced models using tasks core problem object recognition image variation
models most were selected further analysis
show approach significant gains performance variety basic object tasks into computational most important performance
then into design models further evolutionary
scale available computational power computational potential both new study biological
