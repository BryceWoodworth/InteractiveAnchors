detection expressed genes at early could identification genes either
previous methods expressed genes comparing different cell types would include large genes rather than process
demonstrate through use biological novel statistical approach gene expression data obtained without prior cell types expressed genes at early
proposed method analyze cells identified then experimentally novel
statistical approach statistical test generally analyze other processes
introduction
cellular process less cell more cell type characterized expression pattern subset genes during process
search genes widely almost every process although approach still
current practice cell types measure gene expression each cell type then identify expressed genes
methods require expression data both cell types available
methods time cell types example many genes shown expression
set expressed genes may include class early genes early cell well genes whose
however set expressed genes will also include second larger class genes gene expression not important regulation process but genes simply cell types
sample comparison not designed two classes expressed genes result large expressed genes usually do not provide direct mechanisms
early genes cell types at early turn cell types at early identification early genes
however available study new process
demonstrate common belief early genes average expression mixture cell types provided biological been measured statistical test based been used
provide theoretical statistical method two experiments
