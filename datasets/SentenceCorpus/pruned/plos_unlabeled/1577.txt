predicted networks all noise features experimentally networks both species also show observation not due random
addition predicted networks contains information true protein associations first order binary predictions
also most predicted protein associations experimentally our models hidden networks systems
some shows particular functions contains key functional elements protein networks associated important functional like regulation protein signal human cells
thus large important experimental may biological systems
any case predictions provide experimentally regions
introduction
many features biological systems cannot simple their components but rather network properties
organisms systems highly networks networks all components time space
given complexity our current knowledge us complete organisms
therefore development approaches new protein functions functional associations play important role systems biology
knowledge biological systems further experimental error
common different experimental approaches applied same biological system different outcomes resulting protein networks different biological properties
however errors not analysis
example been demonstrated yeast interactions human proteins more than interactions single
there been work biological networks across different species into how networks
however many
observation protein networks across species organisms suggest fast evolution
significant variation functional also been observed protein networks across species
however contrast observations recent work using combined interaction data suggests high protein networks between yeast human
approach based data combination importance different data sources reduce bias associated errors functional prediction increase network been demonstrated studies
increasing accuracy networks different protein interaction data principle multiple independent sources evidence greater confidence than single source
any genome wide computational analyses prediction errors distributed large sample true negative interactions
hence two independent prediction methods will both identify same positive data large like yeast human
general increase number independent approaches same evidence
available integration methods specifically designed interaction datasets method order predictor independent experimental data used
integration method not method example methods
method random distribution prediction hypothesis based information theory statistics
therefore integration independent experimental datasets used study compare predictions
work significantly increase prediction power binary protein functional associations yeast human different individual prediction methods using integration method
three different methods two protein domain
four different prediction datasets obtained methods were using simple integration method examples methods
prediction datasets were also using integration compared against prediction datasets our methods
results integration our prediction datasets were compared against individual prediction methods results methods
all cases demonstrate increased performance approach integration datasets best results
protein pairs identified significant integration were used protein network model yeast human
all associations several major biological including were combined into network
other studies predicted experimental models further comparison
different network parameters were compared between models two test species
how networks change confidence predictions
results network comparison demonstrate networks networks many major features model real protein network associations previously observed some predicted networks
there been observations low between different experimental approaches
our comparison models also show between two models small predictions novel predictions
however between significantly higher than expected random both species between space
data significantly larger yeast than human better functional yeast network presence larger human network still hidden current experimental knowledge
suggest novel prediction set may estimation relative differences associations between both show contains key elements important functional cell
protein network models predicted associations whose existence not yet been experimentally
study suggest involves functional associations difficult current experimental making any network organisms highly therefore
results into four main predicted experimental models human yeast compared
first section analyses performance single methods predicting protein associations correlation between prediction degree accuracy noise predictions
second network features predicted experimental models at levels accuracy noise
third section functional differences between predicted experimental models specific functional appear prediction methods but experimental approaches
section whether predicted network graphs contain additional information protein associations sets predicted protein pairs used networks
