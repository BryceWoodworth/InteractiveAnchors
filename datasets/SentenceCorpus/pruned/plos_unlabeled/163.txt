developed program weights specific properties genes so they may drug targets
applied produce three drug target agent disease new drug needed
each based individual criterion
first metabolic drug targets their their similarity known protein classes
second targets would specifically those conserved within class but lack close
its many years state
potential targets involved
current proposed drug targets respect
some features were found more accurate than others studied targets
also shown targets using evolutionary weights each property
demonstrate approach targets
introduction
cost research development been but amount time required new remains years
problem been length time drug discovery
target identification first step drug discovery process provide years research
all other drug discovery fact identified drug target must variety next
important factors context include between target activity target state target growth
values some selection found available including metabolic pathway protein classification sets proteins
approaches literature integration multiple become
more effective alternative computational integration over different function
article describe application genes genome according given set
