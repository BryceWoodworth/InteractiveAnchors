disordered regions molecular recognition elements play important role control many cellular processes signaling pathways
useful able predict disordered regions protein
statistical analysis disordered residues was unique protein taken database
database percent residues disordered
statistics were obtained n well central part protein
been shown disordered residues types at protein differ ones part protein
our analysis disordered regions revealed disordered patterns different
each them disordered at least protein less than percent
all each disordered pattern disordered
allows one use disordered patterns predicting given protein disordered
selected patterns three three
introduction
prediction protein structure function one general structural
special interest prediction disordered regions protein
disordered regions often play important functional role
should one type disordered regions only when they other molecules under conditions biochemical but other disordered regions always disordered become
disordered regions protein often upon expression proteins
at present more than proteins disordered regions described database
proteins domains either state disordered regions
at important protein regions proteins domains just disordered regions
since disordered regions protein play important role protein much attention being their prediction
indeed been shown disordered proteins certain properties them proteins structures
intrinsic was discussed recent study
typically disordered regions low high well low sequence complexity high
prediction methods aim identify disordered regions through analysis amino sequences using properties amino evolutionary
suggested if one same pattern disordered regions protein structures then highly pattern will disordered other proteins
search disordered patterns important task prediction disordered regions search considered motifs
identification essential features within protein domains their functional
there well protein domain information
disordered patterns one primary tasks respect
there no information about
now known most cases found matrix proteins etc
major recognition site binding
work been disordered residues
rule short domains present only one type because disordered proteins range having no structural preferences 2 residues several even residues
disordered regions disordered motifs their protein protein
taking into account disordered patterns will help predictions residues given region
moreover our new statistics residues will useful those who prediction residues disordered
discovery protein identification new approach further understanding functional role obtained patterns different
question about patterns more important biological
obtained patterns some some
