work our knowledge first time present detailed model transition using example
construct model gene network demonstrate gene expression robust molecular noise program response increase concentration
model then into stochastic population model also motion cell communication
transition explain experimentally observed transition individual model cells into state over range
at same time values critical concentration threshold population density shown robust between individual cells specific particular growth conditions
our modeling approach population scales phenomenon provides questions evolutionary phenomenon
thus demonstrate transition requires much higher threshold cell density than basis formation
introduction
molecular networks signal gene expression into decision all life biological cells including responses environmental factors
one main systems biology understand relationships between properties molecular cellular them
particularly important involving interaction action multiple cells
networks still difficult organisms their complexity
less complex more experimentally organisms systems choice social behavior at genetic level
phenomenon us particularly unique relationships molecular population dynamics
ability populations certain gene expression some critical population density been
found variety species been studied experimentally
phenomenon usually small gene expression network functions gene expression whose
at low cell density state key transcription factor required expression proteins
at same time cell small amount signaling out cell
while population density low most molecules out environment
cell density more molecules
certain cell signal transition network state resulting transcription factor expression target genes
transition both scales focus our study
investigate phenomenon agent disease
species often their unique ability through dna
like many other various
form physical contact their advantage over their
region into cell form complex into genome
one genes class only
other genes cells results formation
themselves into same related species means genetic
been shown requires phenomenon
functional control remains evolutionary
widely processes either adaptive value if not performed population scale
thus fact seems critical density
since multiple cannot dna action does not relevant our case
instead increase probability would appear certain number per
however density cannot estimated using since they do not produce
situation may our understanding biological function not yet complete
indeed alternative function also been proposed
answer what measure using each particular situation necessary consider relevant conditions growth
experimental approach problem often difficulty work real
other hand mathematical modeling significantly experimental methods biological questions involve spatial temporal scales phenomenon
some aspects either population dynamics been gain into phenomenon
however because lack detailed molecular information experimentally between population dynamics been made
here develop modeling approach both dynamics allows us between them explicitly
although much been learned about molecular network not always clear what functions they perform
here construct detailed model network analyze both
demonstrate network properties gene expression robust molecular noise
further develop model motion cell communication while explicitly individual dynamics each cell
allows us describe transition both cellular population scales predict values critical concentration threshold cell density functions various environmental parameters
finally comparing transition present hypothesis evolutionary regulation
all genes thought network itself
network only after
based nature into two major types consider only type
network experimental data
class molecules through cell activation transcription
model assume available at concentration results rate transcription
open transcription
binding its thought occur only within time during when protein single
total makes formation complex
furthermore protein
important rate depends does not depend protein explicitly shown 1
form stable active relatively short
number proteins necessary
first open two cell
since our model transition conditions growth assume present their do not limit rate
both were shown expressed at some low rate even
positive feedback found many
additional feedback also involve other components network specific
thus negative control provided whose transcription directly
through formation very stable complex dna
recently number authors reported like also
reaction between however remains
our model original hypothesis et al complex one one
hypothesis et al who showed must form complex
under assumptions not network behavior
additional positive feedback because transcription contains itself
several evidence suggest active signaling molecules through cell number species including
our model explore hypothesis environment active also under control
indeed contains open whose function not but been active into cell
taking into uncertainty model simply
