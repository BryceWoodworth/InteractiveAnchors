activation occurs order respect level however order activation does not binding sequences
understand lack developed computational model activation transcription factor either increases rna binding either events associated transcription
used model analyze data regulation activity
model lack between order activation order activation only predicted using information about full interaction
analysis further suggests without increasing binding activation even involve binding model activation
findings consistent interactions between e
find activation involving binding lower gene regulation therefore might advantage cells
our model into predicting order activation us suggest activation might involve binding important gene regulation e
introduction
transcription factors control cellular protein binding dna frequency produced
there transcription factors while most target only small number genes there several expression more genes
taken together global transcription factors directly genes e their regulatory interactions important into genetic regulatory network
because they so many genes global transcription factors also play large role cellular however into behavior limited lack quantitative information about how transcription factors target genes
one important global transcription factor family protein genes resulting different levels wide
effect at different due changes detailed sequence site its distance respect
influence order increasing important functional e
quantitative regulation at different recently expression under control determined relationship between concentration concentration examined expression function concentration
found activation occurs order respect level cells response level environment
also found only were at level
contrast assumption found order activation does not binding sequences
finding suggested interactions between rna play important role order activation but data did not what nature interactions might at various
here developed computational model activity understand how interactions between transcription at examined previously three only ones provides important modeling
model was specifically designed compare model increases binding but does not increase rate events more general model either increase binding either increase rate events
each both model general model data at many points within region parameter space
model why order activation does not binding
all best general model was better than model
comparison model full analysis suggest does not increase binding but does increase rate events at
moreover analysis suggests activation involve binding associated low gene regulation
discuss findings
