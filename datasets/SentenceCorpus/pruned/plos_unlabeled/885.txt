introduction
expression other high us study complex human molecular species any given system
now gene expression data into networks functional relationships among genes between genes disease
analysis networks used study any long samples population setting
given populations used study human manner important understand mechanisms conserved between human species especially better predictions drug targets identified human populations
addition mechanisms differ between humans help improve design studies involve models
statistical data results set studies
used examine differences between molecular studies out populations different species
gene network relationship between gene pairs usually measured correlation different correlation correlation information
therefore problem comparing relationships across multiple datasets context correlation various methods been introduced
one method formula test combined correlation obtained individual datasets formula
under general conditions follows formula distribution formula under hypothesis no correlation making possible combined
another widely used method involves average common metric derived correlation individual datasets
then used test over individual measures statistical
datasets type typically accuracy effect size they provide function individual sample
mean effect size its statistical mean effect size
effect size both correlation into standard normal metric using then average
depending whether effect assumed not multiple datasets fixed effect well random effect models
fixed effect models effect size population fixed but unknown constant therefore assumed same all datasets
random effect models effect may assumed random sample all population effect
introduced single method based correlation
one important feature type method effect estimated provides way difference correlation across multiple datasets
provided review methods their applications
networks datasets those different species one central issue often assume every gene pair unique true effect size across species
although random effect models provide more way species variation still distribution population effect
problem method was introduced identification conserved human yeast
method correlation expression between every gene pair were each then according their all other genes
probabilistic test based order statistics was then applied evaluate probability particular across different organisms
advantage method because method based statistics makes no assumption underlying distribution correlation across multiple effect size defined any given gene all other genes considered
however method also several including loss power general given results cannot represented same individual datasets given there no concept mean effect size
individual methods presented methods section
their
paper develop method datasets generated across multiple species
our method nature assumptions distribution effect size than approach while better statistical power than method
also effect size gene allows mean effect size leads test differences correlation structures among distinct datasets
most network alignment algorithms approaches our method does not rely networks individual datasets but instead development statistics test directly relationship between every gene pair
simulation results showed our method robust against
when applied human species networks demonstrate our method existing methods gene pairs conserved among three species
our method also leads identification genes represent core functions been conserved evolution
both highly less study genes levels found conserved way mechanisms levels
application our test leads identification single two experimental populations whose genetic only respect gene
further demonstrate genes involved human specific interactions tend under positive selection evolution
finally identified been play different role type 2 between human
taken together our approach novel step gene networks multiple large scale datasets not only conserved information but also differences
