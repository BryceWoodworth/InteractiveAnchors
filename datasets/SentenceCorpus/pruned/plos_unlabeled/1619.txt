signaling protein required
however mechanism input remains
here experimental observations signaling computer simulations cellular behavior physical properties cells their signaling
find experimental signaling effects cell far contrast previous model influence itself
our experimental observations simulations along contact
best results were obtained under assumption signaling cannot overall cell but will cell relative signaling cells
our results suggest interactions target at cell into
could explain why output signaling despite range itself
our study first cellular model properties cells model signaling pathway including component
discuss potential applications approach
introduction
during development complex organisms spatial reference points need within
often groups cells signaling cells
signaling define systems along cells themselves make decisions
because their importance need both well respect their signaling
one possible mechanism spatial control cells at fixed
phenomenon indeed observed involves groups cells been assume distinct example at
two cell populations seen relatively each other their contact area
assumed help against random may cell arbitrary cell thus any activity associated
how cells distinct
one work attributes cell cell populations might develop distinct differences would then allow them out one another
another based hypothesis suggests cells might contact cells depending cellular depending signaling events
both mechanisms would lead physical would help cell populations
particularly well study formation
not required experimentally through genetic been well characterized
contains events early
initial events give involve signaling between cells studied network genes
cellular both stable development well into life
all cells even when cells one provided growth advantage over cells other
itself simple cell appear random
genetic analysis computational modeling fact cells cell usually physical contact do not each other
been shown experimentally single most cases cells will form cells
behavior suggests processes cell first approximation when
recent study possible formation mechanisms
authors directly demonstrated increased at at using experiments
computer simulations then revealed local sufficient stable
results but they number new formation known depend signaling protein produced cells specifically cells
if indeed what conditions must then
so far all known responses signaling several wide into
how response case region
furthermore experimental signaling been shown lead formation actual
does mean influence signaling does actual if so why does not type situation
here propose model generate outcome signaling respect physical properties despite range molecular response terms target gene expression
furthermore estimate distance up signaling may able cells distance using both experimental results well modeling results estimate at least cell
approach problem first model then physical model
our modeling approach cells their contact described graph
our model follows version model been previously very same
good formation over range simulation parameters modeling outcomes experimental specifically performed study
