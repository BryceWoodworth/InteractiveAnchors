understanding brain mechanisms underlying requires computational models not only but its performance visual tasks
recent years natural become popular study been used show models
here use natural
particular show simple model model should perform at visual object recognition tasks object recognition systems standard natural image recognition test
designed recognition test better variation object position scale show test model
taken together results demonstrate tests based natural potentially direction
instead what means natural argue focus core problem object recognition image variation
introduction
visual object recognition difficult computational problem
core problem each object world number different position relative
yet brain problem
understanding solution object recognition requires recognition systems aim our own visual often biological
computational approaches important because they provide experimentally because recognition system particularly effective measure understanding object recognition
however major recognition performance models
systems should able do what our own visual systems but how evaluate goal
practice choosing image set against test performance
although popular recent approach study use natural part because they problems real world
example computational image set standard testing natural object recognition performance
set large number into object additional
while number specific been set its still widely used both theoretical experimental
number those place high object recognition systems require them solve computational object recognition
because there object performance less than 1 percent correct
recent years several object recognition models shown what high performance test better than percent correct approaches while still well below human performance at least direction
however argue here not clear what extent natural image tests actually core problem object recognition
specifically while set contains large number object view position size etc between within object defined not
furthermore image strongly object
also human how should thus objects within image not random set may not variation found real world
furthermore if object recognition task not know what makes different variation all together
problems not unique set but also apply other natural image sets
