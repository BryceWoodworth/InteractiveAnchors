introduction
one computational modeling cellular systems lack tools
if one molecules cells they then one model reactions cells use
however assumptions
most cellular processes depend at least some extent spatial
example cell signaling systems signals across significant within across
also cell systems one cell into two molecular components
many cellular exhibit random variation must random differences molecular
examples range random between states variation cell signaling systems
more generally stochastic behavior likely affect outcomes all cellular processes
representation complexity requires algorithms model cellular processes spatial accuracy model reactions they stochastic
computational four main approaches biochemical systems spatial stochastic
differ how they represent space time molecules turn classes biological systems they
spatial method based stochastic simulation algorithms
simulation into each contains many molecules interest
method efficient because total number individual classes molecules per rather than individual molecules
however structure uses space into does not work well membrane require special treatment
method space into much so each contain one
method molecules between sites molecules sites
itself studies complex formation effects reactions
not found wide use processes due high computational specific structures affect reaction rates although recent techniques may
methods primary focus article most widely used spatial stochastic methods
represent individual molecules continuous space over fixed time molecules when they
fact models use continuous space makes membrane relatively represent high spatial
need individual molecules however high computational so methods about factor two than spatial methods
finally function reaction dynamics methods especially accurate simulation
methods step simulation exact time one individual reaction exact time next
makes methods systems long between individual reactions but very most cellular processes
based
many common features but differ other features quantitative accuracy their simulations
three features but particularly use only both spatial simulations
program been used most quality number features make particularly well cellular processes involved synaptic transmission
relative but most accurate results
also number attributes 2 below make well modeling wide range cellular processes
article version
several algorithms were based reaction dynamics
were used investigate spatial version cell protein signaling e
original accuracy but significantly
particular represent membrane molecules wide variety interactions
make general possible also spatial reaction network molecules conformational interactions over system observation
will particularly useful cellular systems signaling metabolic systems basic effects molecular data rates investigated
