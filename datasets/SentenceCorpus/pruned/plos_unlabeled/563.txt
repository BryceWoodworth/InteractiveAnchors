introduction
problem combination aspects
still not able provide effective most complex main able address human functional
when biological involves complex biological networks multiple targets likely required
because effect depends several need studied number possible
example many cancer more more than used even larger might
if were study all out at different would
example shows problem requires new approach rather than simply more efficient
combined drug common strategy complex cancer
out recently cancer most were developed effective single agents only later combined
possible approach new not present individual based study all possible pairs
approach many novel pairs but resulting number larger
several authors recently future combination development accurate quantitative network models interactions cellular
et al do not yet know what models will like systems biology research still
indeed their recent review does not report any application approach combination
here suggest novel solution problem combination drug making use search algorithms developed communication
when several key aspects search strategies used find more effective combined without need experimental design
algorithms may also provide framework upon information molecular data computational networks models
understand our work important consider even if simulations might play role use algorithms not but using biological measurements organisms cells
approach relevant because developed drug large now more more available
useful information processing our experimental systems biological since algorithms using indeed derived algorithms were other
measurements
there computational complexity algorithms limit choice approaches
discussed more results
both number computational unique algorithms should considered
algorithm design requires application appropriate structure data
although there many options represent space possible drug used tree representation drug nodes all possible one drug next level
individual form base tree maximum size at
when drug combination tree smaller larger algorithms suggest more weight drug interactions
consistent data available drug interactions reported
optimal size combination different problem examined
effect combination also due components multiple effects
search algorithms suggest derived sequential algorithms
were chosen part because among data biological applications
sequential algorithms used nodes data tree related different but
another feature sequential algorithms our use memory taken each
provide detailed algorithm should able all available information state system obtained measurements
integration should take place at every within algorithm rather than being average different methods applied
presence each provides our algorithms natural mean information integration
both show 1 complex structure biological networks being systems biology measurements along data tree
therefore algorithms search within solution space
if relation among combination were linear best algorithm would simply determine best single drug measurements use obtain best combination
if were use stochastic algorithms might
stochastic algorithms multiple local solution space but they do so random
requires terms computational cost performance stochastic algorithms therefore often not good more algorithms
algorithms suggest variable previous nodes tree
sequential algorithm was developed search optimal field describe test algorithms used search optimal combination number testing only small subset all possible
algorithms useful large where datasets not
present results obtained simulations computational model cell experiments using two models biological function human cancer cells
first experimental model advantage including complexity whole while second model potential higher testing
models also two different general types one type at function while other based cell network function
results suggest optimal found systems only small number tests design significantly higher than random
