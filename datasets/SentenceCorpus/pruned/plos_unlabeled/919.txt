introduction
group conserved pattern recognition processes adaptive
recent activity focused network its responses
signaling primary responses been several including disease
indeed even cases response activation signaling pathways lead other conditions
there much interest development methods signaling
example one approach involves specific reactions components within network will signaling pathways while not other signaling components
reactions components should highly specific network also one transcription target
therefore available data sets network need into more better understanding associated signaling pathways other cellular networks
approach necessary achieve goal effects receptor signaling upon responses
need particularly important given amount experimental data about signaling too large simply complex interactions
so far relatively few been made experimental data into single representation
hence there need investigate function network using computational model particularly further into action their effects
analysis methods represent systems approach computational modeling biological networks
all known biochemical particular system various data sources genomic biochemical physiological data
existing knowledge into model its functional properties
involves reaction into matrix each network reaction lower bounds network reactions
constraints include reaction rates
environmental constraints applied represent different components
many computational analysis tools been developed including analysis
network linear optimization problem specific objective function
methods well metabolic networks both analysis tools widely used
furthermore methods been applied other important cellular functions transcription regulation signaling including
study present extended model network based available approach
signaling networks been using pathway analysis
however since analysis networks could not apply method network
contrast network been method networks into more
another approach network complexity focus input output relationships
used network reactions into distinct input output pathways show different patterns signal activation control
furthermore used representation complex signaling network determine control points network specific pathway
control points allow signaling will change signaling while not having effect other signaling components
taken together show study how signaling network used identify potential drug
