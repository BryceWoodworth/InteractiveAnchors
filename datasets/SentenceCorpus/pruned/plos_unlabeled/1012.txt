introduction
more specifically proteins show complex behavior at cellular system level interaction networks also at individual level where proteins show large degree single protein different conformational states
complex system dynamics protein cannot its instead system must whole
tools able represent information complex system thus necessary
complex network theory used different study metabolic reactions genetic regulatory systems study protein dynamics
latter context studies conformational space proteins making use network where nodes account
some studies determine common general properties conformational networks at clustering number connectivity etc recently network corresponding free energy use algorithms over conformational networks been proposed
although approach analysis free energy based description network leads multiple thus difficult clear found
similar approach used analyze complex dynamics models
state models let us information one several molecular dynamics set certain transition probabilities among them
therefore into transition matrix global times
use models proposed aim states
however above approaches analyze involves large computational either general algorithms large transition matrices
finally other strategies understand based study potential energy
classical theory allows us behavior system at certain knowledge transition states
approach some approximation limit high assumption high etc could directly data
article make novel study its structure hence conformational states between them
approaches presented obtained simulations into conformational markov network
show how graph obtain through its main features their times rate between conformational states
framework shown potential
after studied main characteristics its
