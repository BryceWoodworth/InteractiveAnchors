one example discovery transcription factor binding motifs measurements
several major sequence discovery still require need approach data into target lack models exact need appropriate framework tendency many existing methods report significant motifs even when applied generated data
paper present statistical framework sequence elements four
demonstrate framework application sequence motifs dna sequences
applied data obtained following results
identification novel transcription factor binding sites yeast data
biological function some them was further investigated gain new transcription regulation networks yeast
example our network
another finding binding sequences
discovery novel motifs human cancer data
most motifs similar dna sequence elements bound complex
our findings thus support model
overall demonstrate statistical framework highly effective regulatory sequence elements variety applications expression data
available at
introduction
paper problem sequence motifs biological sequence data
widely more task given target set set sequences identify sequence motifs target set compared set
paper make more so target set data manner
discovery sequences attributes target set compared set become useful wide range applications molecular biology research
example discovery dna sequence motifs set regions genes suggest
another example discovery dna sequences set regions certain transcription factor strongly measurements
same principle may extended many other applications discovery genomic elements set highly sequences
due its importance task dna their corresponding much attention literature
any approach discovery must address several fundamental
first issue way motifs represented
there several strategies using where each fixed set possible at single position using position weight matrix probability each at each position
both assume base position
higher order been proposed
while position assumption they more lack data model parameters
method described paper uses model above
second issue
many strategies motifs been suggested literature
one simple yet approach uses distribution set sequences then motifs using algorithm
framework described paper natural approach
search algorithm each
uses sampling algorithm finding global sequence
metric used determine alignment
uses maximization strategy relative entropy associated each
defined search space motifs significantly high identified
determine statistical obtained many methods simulations
several different strategies detection use quantitative compare their performance
related discovery paper properties clusters binding sites
examples approaches search patterns underlying binding gene expression include
