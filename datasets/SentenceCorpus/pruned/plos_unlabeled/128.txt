elements alternative under evolutionary
using genomic alignment identified exhibit short regions high alternative
experiments gene conserved regions important alternative regulation
conserved sequences were into each was
compared frequency conserved elements all c sequences order identify short motifs more likely associated alternative
motifs were examined preferences alternative
many high motifs known regulatory sequences mechanism alternative regulation well conserved
comparison analysis conserved elements analysis same increase sensitivity regulatory motifs
approach also identified novel sequences whose role under us take step regulatory elements

introduction
one learned analysis human genome may than genes
one mechanism increase complexity human number genes allow some genes multiple proteins
process alternative rna
studies use expressed sequence identify genes researchers predict up percent human genes
alternative events additional mechanisms regulation gene expression
understanding alternative its regulation key component understanding genomes
current models alternative regulation based interactions rna sequences known elements regulatory proteins known factors
binding factors ability alternative
role elements well been shown work based factors present
example human gene control sequence found
sequence site both factors
protein also alternative through interactions rna sequence sequence been shown important alternative regulation
many other examples complex regulation alternative through elements been demonstrated interactions between proteins binding protein specific sequences important alternative regulation
sequences therefore they should less evolutionary their sequence
should sequences alternative
analysis human was found average sequence either tend highly conserved between human genomes percent sequences percent sequences
some potential regulatory motifs studies
example found sequence was second most common first percent regions
another study alternative found most conserved region alternative
third study found alternative its presence highly conserved genes
using model system been take advantage comparative identify alternative
c gene structure gene expression regulation similar other higher average size smaller
our previously developed methods identification genes c genome sequence sequence
developed algorithm genome between c related
hidden markov model identify regions high low no
also factors at c into its when region high
c c years yet
alignment two genomes revealed sequences highly conserved between species but sequences conserved
found high sequences more likely occur than total
conserved regions were regulatory elements alternative
alignment relatively limited regions high provides more specific regulatory elements than much conserved regions alternative
paper present analysis conserved regions c conserved regions alternative regulation
conserved sequence regions into database relative total database similar method used group identify
us potential alternative motifs
since many rna recognition factors specific sequences order length motifs may represent specific binding sites particular factors
several our motifs analysis known regulatory elements example but several not been previously identified
number identified method were tested system c
used analysis identify new highly conserved alternative regulatory
show sequence alternative gene
