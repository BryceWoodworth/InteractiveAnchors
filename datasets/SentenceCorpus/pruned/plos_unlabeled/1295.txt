introduction
sequence data over genome available through genomes online database more than protein structures protein data
while sequences represent large limited number possible estimated at researchers sequences structure
single limited number functions between average

low overall sequence
one key family new sequences known
depending only amino sequence alignment techniques new
instead use more structure information search because many primary sequences produce same
researchers then sequences through recognition
et al used identify new including
more recently similar strategy potential new

our approach rather than studies
here features patterns known explain how they new
use methods structure cell activation binding target binding reaction mechanism
computer approach several
environment way study new
often
also within genomes researchers make sequences available than biochemical studies
new might play role current also drug targets against
