instead being recent studies suggest characterized domains
particular number experimental studies revealed existence highly domains
domains called functional been suggested take part variety dynamic cellular processes membrane signal regulation activity membrane proteins
however despite proposed importance domains their properties even nature open because associated short time length scales major experiments
work simulations properties
two phase one system same size phase
studies provide evidence presence leads strongly
also find characterized though observed more difficult
findings aspects role interactions within role properties membrane its
also show presence leads different corresponding
results propose certain classes membrane proteins changes change
introduction
understanding membrane structures their role cellular functions developed significantly since introduction classical model
model predicted cellular characterized random distribution molecular components membrane resulting
more recent more however
large number experimental results idea domains exist biological
domains called functional been suggested take part various dynamic cellular processes membrane signal regulation activity membrane proteins
existence stable biological under their existence actually under since if they do exist too small techniques
direct evidence based membrane proteins membrane environments
however difficult perform experiments using cells measurements physical exact size
model domains disordered phase widely
example d phase may while formation phase mixture
current understanding biological suggests structure domains various rather than phase
exact nature underlying interactions lead under
particularly important been shown increase conformational order reduce area hence significantly increasing density
particularly effective space within region related area increased membrane increasing
however rates not expected more than factor 2 when d phase compared phase
also recently been reported significantly
important changes been suggested related changes membrane protein structure activity
estimates range they make subject computational studies
though importance only few simulations structural properties local interactions between
particular there no previous computational studies nature their structural features
example scale structure within domains its effects not
further resulting properties membrane not either
finally most associated unknown
concept across membrane significant since molecules membrane
proposed molecules into membrane changes would across membrane hence changes would changes membrane protein structure
experimental studies issue difficult there only one study overall
detailed simulations called
extent simulations work time quantitative analysis properties not before
level simulations three
systems call s s b s c
based recent experimental phase expected d phase domains single d phase
here distinct nature domains three
first consider dynamic properties turn out very different those
second provide evidence presence leads strongly characterized significant within domains
findings role interactions within significant role formation
third provide evidence change
particular show how presence leads different corresponding may certain classes membrane proteins through changes hence
