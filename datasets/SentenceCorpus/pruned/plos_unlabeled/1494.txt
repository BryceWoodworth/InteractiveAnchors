introduction
conformational proteins fundamental variety biological functions
instance give binding therefore interest over many
end points transition t state state characterized low high binding population number
lower phenomenon effect
percent effect been residues also
transition pathway were based structures corresponding t state
according structures transition described 1 1 respect 1 2
later second structure was found larger distance between two compared structure
differences between at 1 2 still whether stable pathway
experiments solution between structures
more recently two additional structures were found using conditions view state solution far being
structure between whereas distance between two reduced compared structure
identify transition pathway response
t transition after been studied using techniques including
derived experiments suggests t pathway via several rates time constant s overall t transition
experiments provide into but they also
they do not directly global but measure formation residues must terms conformational
t transition could so far derived using
experiments provide whereas may transition pathways may not
furthermore contrast t transition little known about t transition because transition cannot
molecular dynamics simulations provide therefore well experimental
early focused were dynamic treatment subset residues
considered response several time scale within using technique called method
addition set simulation up were out focus mechanism
recently single simulation was without any conformational
studies normal analysis considered intrinsic network study suggested transition transition pathway
so far no were observed during simulations since previous simulations were too short time scales
here apply simulations investigate t state human
first time well
hence simulations allow one study transition mechanism
find pathway primary transition pathway
find between
based simulation results present mechanism underlying transition pathway between t states
