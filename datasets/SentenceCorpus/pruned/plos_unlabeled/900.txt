cell involves interactions well global signal
many genetic molecular components underlying process been experimentally identified recently model suggested observed terms interactions involving membrane bound proteins
among key open questions understanding effect role global signal
our understanding physical systems
here understand order
end develop representation underlying molecular processes define phase model provides global view parameters
show dynamics two growth local process alignment small large scales
discuss response various types signals show global order signal provided during early phase process
finally define discuss some experimental predictions model
introduction
addition their within cells phenomenon called cell
growth direction small cell
where cells form all point direction
series recent experiments show several key proteins including proteins proteins cell direction within each cell pattern protein
other experiments show local depends signaling
first activity large cells
observations
1 second do not all point direction yet their strongly correlated between cells across pattern
thus experimental evidence suggests interaction between cells their
local need not point addition there global signal out direction
yet clear molecular pathway remains now unknown
patterns recent evidence suggest field related presence pathway
observations between behavior studied well terms statistical relatively simple models
models each site assume different
properties influence interaction between their influence tend direction
typically exhibit two high phase where disordered low phase where interactions over leading arbitrary direction
state even small field effect itself field yet dynamics leading global alignment
essential statistical disordered states exist class models discussed general context classification different function few parameters
study between interaction influence introduced molecular interactions
statistical define phase different behavior space most relevant parameters
then address role global signal dynamics global alignment
molecular model formation was recently proposed
was shown number experimental findings
model involves parameters were set
here alternative approach instead more more complex models develop model smaller number smaller number parameters
instead particular set parameters data explore behavior model function parameters quantitative features different
model identify several essential required obtain pattern
our model important properties although does not all molecular
after essential model obtain phase its state properties
then consider dynamics local presence global signal
show global alignment global signal provided present at dynamics
finally discuss experimental predictions out model tools required test predictions
