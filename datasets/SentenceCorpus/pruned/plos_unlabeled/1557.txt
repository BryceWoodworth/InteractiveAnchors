important method both natural molecules but interactions cells critical difficult using approaches
work predicted growth factor under using computer modeling experimental approach characteristics binding interactions limited
understanding features process was
experimental under
physical design system was into model parameters
growth factor growth was used both experiments simulations
our computational model was three cell reaction
model based reactions within single was total number comparison experimental results
our model predicted experiments system would result loss binding proteins but not proteins do not
model further predicted significant loss bound protein at rates only higher than average rates experimentally probability single at high rates low
several other key parameters were investigated between shown critical impact
combined system examine quantitative manner should prove drug
introduction
molecules they through factor their signaling
determine drug simply
although measurements made researchers levels molecules determine interactions not measured observed
while some molecules may long life many may only single before being through
addition even molecules long life may still direct interaction
example case growth factor when bound vegf
been shown increase concentration vegf cancer patients when compared patients not because increased growth however complex vegf making vegf
order better understand drug interactions context better tools needed provide measurements predict molecules
many important measurements made using methods but there approach
influence whether remains phase factor
influence cannot studies
example while at level less than 1
reduction allows processes at level take place more likely also activity molecules rely cell binding order their
while direct binding process difficult our model makes use under environment directly measure loss molecules they through
used single method allow better effect either molecules their interaction
our approach also makes use since way would setting
binding growth its cell receptor role process been research interest many years because their role growth new existing
knowledge how processes work could development new control growth treatment
order understand mechanism cell experimental studies been past two several computational models binding its receptor been proposed
through modeling could not obtained
were among researchers develop simple model three species
they measured binding rate experimentally used their model analyze data complexity binding
similar approach was used et al investigate complex their measurements
introduced more complexity into binding model binding receptor formation alternative species
recent models towards including signaling
work previous simulation work been based environment may different dynamic environment
introduced computational model based environment binding environment was
paper use version model explore how specific parameters rate impact receptor binding compare our results experimental studies
importance within phase were found
described simulation provides new way investigate growth factor extended other relevant molecules
