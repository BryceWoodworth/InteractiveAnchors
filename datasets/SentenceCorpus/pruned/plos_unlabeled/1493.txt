taken together our analysis not only new into cell regulatory network but also provides novel widely strategy experimental measurements into network models
introduction
appropriate control gene expression central development

interactions regulatory proteins regulatory regions dna form complex gene regulatory networks
whole genome sequences well experimental techniques identification regulatory sequences
however experiments underlying connectivity both time
our understanding even most studied model organisms remains
moreover simply increasing numbers interactions between components not sufficient underlying network function individual
properties will key understanding their
development cells through cells via cells each associated unique regulatory state
therefore essential understand properties various regulatory states between them their signaling
goal using experimental approaches
however development models potential existing experimental data order gain new
various computational approaches been used regulatory network analysis past
models provide information about network behavior existence states network robustness most useful large networks when experimental information
however examine aspects continuous models more appropriate
models gene regulation form functions based more detailed mechanisms derived using statistical approach
models useful understanding general dynamics network
they most effective small networks also predictive cellular behavior
models based advantage including hypothesis about system
most parameters models direct biochemical
lack knowledge about specific biochemical parameters usually makes difficult results models experimental information about gene expression
modeling approach been shown useful understanding certain gene regulation effects dynamics gene regulation
system long model study cells
cell functional very detailed pathways leading early via cells multiple
long been key but networks within they defined
detailed molecular regulatory elements active during early development identified specific between major regulatory specific
moreover studies identified degree positive feedback connectivity major
particular regulatory at core
three transcription factor proteins well three regulatory elements through they via interactions
regulatory interactions shown only significant binding sites shown
contain multiple binding motifs

however nature how may indeed remains
paper construct mathematical model its properties using continuous modeling approaches
first propose method free different regions measurements
method together proposed biochemical mechanism significantly network parameter space

analyze network response relevant signals show network response signals
our model also predicts results various mutations sequences shows signals than threshold
combination short signal not only provides new how may function control but also suggests more general role network development other major systems
