appear population at mutation selection
concept recently attention because many rna appear generate high levels genetic variation may evolution drug
literature important evolutionary processes however
here use simple models mutation selection theory most novel property error threshold mutation rate below populations mutation selection above population error loss through mutations
models show single may contain multiple error error threshold affected extent mutation
error threshold distinct threshold complete loss population through mutations
based framework argue not true error but
introduction
concept mutation selection one most fundamental population natural selection increases frequency while mutations introduce distribution between two effects
mutation selection been explain genes example those underlying genetic even
despite long history concept some its were only when studied mutation selection dynamics long genomes
found populations do not mutation selection most common but rather
later called at
concept not only mutation selection theory based simple one systems but also novel into impact mutation rate evolutionary dynamics
particular found there states mutation rate lead fundamental change population
change phase transition terms called error
error been applied high mutation rates likely life rna genomes
model populations mutation model been explain populations robust regions
error concept much literature rna evolution now uses high mutation rate
short review its relationship population theory provided
were developed context genomes many each mutation
since been considered context
yet many its much case few our approach here
our results not new per but our models should correct some common
