model based stochastic cell cycle cell uses evolutionary algorithms further experimental data sets system variables
at population level cells provide same statistical distributions their real addition model information at single cell level

development cell model reference experimental data provides analysis biological knowledge obtained directly via cell population
approach study cell biology cell population data available applied including experimental data
introduction
widely used study cell cycle its context both basic research analysis
analyses may use wide range expression key molecular components cell cycle dependent dna
particular used quantitative biological knowledge based statistical analyses experimental data sets
single variable distributions may include increasing provide mean etc test
more complex approaches may involve function component analysis space
all approaches there common data statistical set biological form function correlated
work present alternative based computational simulation experiment
stochastic simulation cell cycle dynamics within large population reference data set then using evolutionary computer algorithms measures derived data sets
information then directly populations
development cell population approach been evolution large numbers cells over multiple through cell cycle provide means both whole cell population distinct
context cell cycle response events effects cell designed cell
report present basis cell
demonstrate application technique its potential use cell cycle cell cell cycle
aim simulation predict dynamic evolution large population cells through life cycle corresponding their
furthermore model account cell cycle population
spatial position within cell cycle determined real data set
information each temporal position within mean time cell cycle events dna cell predicted
after given they may compared further experimental data set important simulation parameters their evolution so between data sets
standard approaches cell cycle involve statistical analysis distributions either involving when further cell cycle molecular also
thus whole population measures only describe cell via global parameters standard mean
approaches been developed order reduce analyses still involve data set identify cells
population provides temporal further cells different g 1 s g within normal
quantitative become extent subjective they based either identification various components distributions g 1 s g dna
current computational approach where at biology not data
no new data approach computer simulations could form data analysis
however does new process continuous simulation dynamic evolution cellular system between fixed sampling points
respect provides physical when various experimental data
also some way variation between individual cells biological stochastic simulation report population dynamics each every cell
