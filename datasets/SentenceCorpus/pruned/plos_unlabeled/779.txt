introduction
sequence structural data being generated
functional sequences structures significantly
time cost experimental techniques required function all proteins
therefore computational means been useful popular predicting functions amount sequence structure data
however protein function prediction itself difficult problem since difficult define function
various functional been developed over years various aspects protein function
instead existing functional proposed role individual amino residues protein function functional used
cases protein function represented simply series quantitative values each functional importance corresponding amino protein sequence structure
quantitative values each used combined approach into account individual various function prediction algorithms each amino given protein
our following four types four different types sequence evolutionary structural stability amino type
all generated via simple algorithms their combined use algorithms use only one source information
sequence one most methods functional importance individual amino
amino residues more variation patterns usually more important protein function
concept often used identify functional regions proteins multiple between target sequence all its sequence then degree sequence among each alignment site
various measures sequence been proposed over years complexity
measures sequence entropy its
more measures other information amino similarity properties theoretical sequence into
program different but tend each other
recently was also shown measure predicting important residues sites further accuracy
previously demonstrated relative entropy measure amino better predict functional sites than simple entropy measures
furthermore found amino estimated hidden markov models further performance relative entropy measure
current study use sequence measure derived one component our
addition sequence also evolutionary information
many studies shown use relationships among group related sequences help accurate prediction functional sites
evolutionary method one first most methods variation patterns within between protein multiple important residues protein structure importance
further development evolutionary method allows quantitative importance use evolutionary information entropy measures
method relationships group similar sequences bayesian maximum likelihood method information protein
further study et al used evolutionary models assumed different matrix each site protein functional sites
et al used evolutionary relationships among sequence protein functional sites
et al presented several methods given protein family into search residues determine
among all methods sequence relationships based evolutionary tree thus additional level information instead multiple sequence
here propose novel method called state step evolutionary
based given multiple construct maximum tree analyze variation patterns tree tree each amino
simple yet effective way evolutionary
functional also derived methods using experimentally determined predicted protein structures
example recent study demonstrated regions protein structures often used provide information functional inference functional site identification
given structure given position propose other amino their structural stability turn used each protein
hence also component protein function prediction
previously developed probability function statistics database experimental structures structures more likely similar experimentally derived structures
been recent years protein structure prediction
here further mutations basis
each given protein was one alternative amino new structures were further stability
our current used two based functions measure how all structures each other how experimentally determined structure structures represent potential impact stability position
residues conserved structure versus function
additional component information type amino more likely functional sites than other amino
however prior probability functional site not explicitly most current functional site prediction algorithms
our used binary variables represent amino each position given protein
also examined whether use amino information use could provide additional information better performance
given complexity protein functional sites no single method will always work all protein functional site information
therefore several groups information various sources especially information give more accurate predictions
work et al shown structural functional constraints amino residues leads better prediction protein interaction sites
shown both structural functional constraints protein evolution better identify functional sites
recently et al showed integration selected sequence structure features into support vector machine framework improve identification sites
furthermore et al sequence amino distribution predicted secondary structure relative into probability density framework showed at percent sensitivity method leads percent increase over methods predicting residues site site
et al investigated various features residues novel structural showed measure sequence measure structural degree structural environment best sites
other similar studies also features into framework site identification
previous work suggests value using several sequence structure components sites
approaches were based algorithms current study aim several sources information sequence structure evolution type amino together via simple regression model function prediction including both sites binding sites
major advantage regression model each component associated individual protein studied gain additional into different aspects protein function not available when many components into framework
compare approach several other functional site prediction algorithms propose our approach wide function discuss how different components used understand biological function via four examples
