introduction
yeast expressed cell cycle dependent manner
both yeast yeast into four groups each corresponding phase cycle
large sets also seen cells transcription network fundamental property
complete connectivity cell cycle transcription network not yet known any many components may over long evolutionary but some specific some their direct target genes
experimental core components make yeast cycle especially good test case studies network structure function evolution
underlying transcription network point cell cycle into its component regulatory factors their regulatory output patterns here form rna expression
one way do multiple data types inference including interaction data studies rna expression patterns comparative genomic analysis
because so they principle regulatory relationships not classical
however scale complexity datasets require new methods rank while also experimental biological noise
rna expression studies yeast identified genes number all yeast genes
experimental design methods analysis wide range number genes but there core set
yeast molecular genetic studies regulation critical rna expression some genes though does not additional mechanisms
about transcription factors been associated direct control cell cycle expression patterns including assume both depending
control
yeast genes no cell cycle expression true group
practical how well behavior network represented critical datasets
case cells all cell cycle present phase yeast used most complete set global interaction data so far functional
data further three smaller studies same basic design
sets cell cycle many other transcription networks whose multiple states either global data
important rna expression data every gene across cycle yeast also related yeast s
combination highly rna expression data data used interactions cell cycle while evolutionary comparison s conserved fundamental network properties
many prior yeast transcription network data were designed address global problem finding patterns across yeast using very large yeast rna dna data
present work instead single cellular process its underlying gene network natural level between single gene at one networks cell
model regulatory gene behavior neural networks global expression interaction data
neural networks structural computational models long history pattern recognition
general could effective task they some natural transcription networks including ability sparse interactions between target genes
they previously been applied model relatively small gene though they not our knowledge been used problem network structure data
simple would two additional known characteristics gene networks
first factor binding over values data binding site numbers site mutation analyses
quantitative differences biological transcription output expression lack temporal sequencing gene factors become available
different world binding reduced simple call
neural networks able use full range binding probabilities
second give weight attention structural features specific factors particular target groups genes
negative image information potentially important not used other methods applied
ability use properties potential compared algorithms positive evidence binding require binding measurements into call
been most used machine learning perform classification tasks goal network based training will used perform similar new data similar structure
classical applications weights within network no particular interest long network classification task when new data
used here different way structural models
specifically use simple networks results interest weights what they suggest about importance individual transcription factors groups factors particular expression
here were predict rna expression behavior genes during cell cycle based transcription factor binding pattern measured yeast factors determined
resulting model then identify most important gene associations weights
major known cell cycle expression at very model
cell cycle were robust series mutations binding data specific factor was new family models were generated
additional networks identified relationships biological network
approach was also applied two additional independent cell cycle expression studies across data how networks might change under distinct cell
analysis weights matrices resulting models shows neural take advantage information about specifically between factors expression patterns together expected positive other factors genes their correct expression
us if there corresponding bias biological network against binding sites specific factors some expression suggested
found case multiple yeast genomes relatively related also related yeast s
conserved network property even though very few specific genes involved
