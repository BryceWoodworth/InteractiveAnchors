introduction
cellular signal two stimuli signaling turn responses
type regulation usually time scale will fast regulation paper
fast regulation involves protein order signals
responses fast regulation transcription factors often turn total their own
example signal pathways system concentration their own positive negative feedback about
signaling via kinase
long most proteins type regulation time scale most cases thus will regulation here
shows view signal stimuli gene expression turn cellular signal processing
previous theoretical experimental studies how fast regulation regulation while effects impact regulation fast regulation less well investigated
however regulation important since expression during variety physiological processes development cell cycle
furthermore expression been shown correlated cancer
at first one may expression 1 signal transmission via 1 linear
however recent research suggests strong observed at least some variety genes involved cellular signal do not hypothesis they do not require loss both support
instead loss single protein expression sufficient function phenomenon been
suggests expression signaling proteins signal transmission highly
increased signal transmission been regulation will here
available experimental data suggest different cellular responses known sets early genes although early
allows cells differences early gene expression thus kinase signaling
addition even target less than
thus transcription significant activation so relatively towards
cases increase cellular effects may help decisions
finally strong known noise reduction cellular
most common information been estimated one third all cellular proteins
several were whether occur simple cycle
show here possible experimentally measured particularly parameter range where subject
furthermore show transcription multiple proteins within kinase result even more
finally demonstrate account regulation cellular signal
