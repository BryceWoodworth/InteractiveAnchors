introduction
structure protein its function
knowledge structure therefore used design improve other information mutations identify protein
methods required determine structure protein
membrane proteins essential variety processes including signaling significant biological interest
however they not existing methods even though some most difficult problems area been recent years number known structures membrane structures remains very low
computational methods predict basic proteins available information therefore interest
most predicted include not only but should also n relative membrane
many proteins include short signal protein across membrane after
signal strongly not part protein but often protein
protein often having signal
therefore signal prediction prediction should performed rather than being two tasks
membrane proteins into two structural those membrane using those use
found only small all membrane proteins
some attention been given some structures random regions
work however focus class both because most membrane proteins into class because they most known structures
two most common machine learning approaches applied prediction both signal proteins hidden markov models neural networks while some use combination two approaches
particularly well sequence tasks prior knowledge into structure while learn make classification decisions based
first protein were introduced years
both define set structural classes variation amino different membrane protein
example known highly generally contain more amino than
during training set distributions one each structural classes
using training approach using algorithm
introduced hypothesis difference between amino distributions various structural classes main protein therefore most likely one difference given protein
was also first allow additional evidence one more within protein sequence
presence signal within given protein also been predicted using both
above between signal one sources error both signal
difficulty was designed signal model model
authors showed including signal overall accuracy proteins signal proteins
work introduce combined signal predictor power dynamic bayesian networks
application task provides several new procedure new way distributions new approach uncertainty during training
problem among four basic types signal signal
also predicts signal site complete membrane proteins
report results task over prediction task
also introduce set confidence measures at three different at level protein type at level individual at level full
confidence measures predictions were introduced n et al upon work three types well observed
finally based predictions yeast protein database provide relative different types proteins different organisms well class membrane proteins
protein prediction learning problem over amino sequences
training set pairs sequences form where 1 n sequence amino protein known s s 1 s n corresponding sequence
i amino formula s i formula corresponding signal
after training learned model parameters input single amino test sequence predict best corresponding sequence s
solve problem using call
before our model first review explain how they simple form
framework provides significantly relative described
recently provides introduction probabilistic inference using bayesian networks variety applications computational biology
