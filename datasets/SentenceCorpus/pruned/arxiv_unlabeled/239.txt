variable contain large numbers time series data domain
objects classes important step towards discovery new classes objects
most detection methods time series data assume either single continuous time series set time series whose
data use methods any given pair may out
one may use existing detection method if prior similarity one two scales data sets
paper detection method large sets data both global local
its each relation set produced clustering algorithm
our method able scale large data sets through use sampling
our method both data other time series data sets
demonstrate its at finding known discuss effect sample size number our results
compare our method solutions existing time series detection methods data show reported better than all other methods
finally our true might novel detection time series
introduction
were all who while data primary whose further study
were possible when had close their data
data sets through if not
detection may discovery identify novel objects our research detection time series data called data
our specific application find sets variable
most like our own almost constant whereas variable significant
there over variable more being
general variable known variable our own well other
variable
common types variable include found
study variable importance
example study most method constant study binary discovery true
finding new class variable will value
shows each class before after perform our techniques described section
measures
observation thus values
measures time
where all single why there may multiple points single time point
describe process more section } our research detection large sets variable
several common many time series data sets
there large number each high low data
indeed new response system produce
any technique developed must scale very large data sets
unique data not because each generated different source
understand why detection domain consider how two similar may appear under similarity measure like distance if phase not performed
shows two similar whose not
shows correlation function phase
maximum similarity occurs at phase
shows two after amount
define optimal phase between two maximum similarity value
problem both general detection techniques those developed specifically time series
general detection method even metric data may not work out
time series detection techniques our task finding distinct time series most work single time series not
our solution problem detection large sets time series
clustering algorithm called sampling data
each time series prior similarity
because provide does not convergence properties
sampling data
use sampling scale large data sets
online each time series set produced
linear size data set
another advantage its two types local global
define terms local global provide methods both
each time series time series review
our knowledge only detection method developed specifically time series data output both global local
our paper empirical evidence four data sets known better when compared solutions other detection methods time series
discuss effect sample size parameter used detection results show experimental results data unknown number
our paper found
