scenarios involve interaction between at least two agents who must how objects using words
here consider models two types learning learning individuals determine common across all observed uses learning there strong feedback between individuals about words
despite differences between learning show they same communication accuracy large result classical problem objects words
introduction
how group agents major open issue evolution research area
addition dynamics one computational mathematical modeling most some type threshold phenomenon
cannot without parameter space models
there two main research investigate
first approach work who natural selection main design principle explain complex structure evolutionary algorithms
key here communication ability individual results average increase number
second research will paper based view evolution so through learning during
if there fact about must learned active interaction between
issue whether ability learn due some learning mechanism ability unique humans still
problem address here there simply no individuals so not so biological rather than
will use many produced research see eg study different learning strategies
perspective there two
first learning based idea one way determine find common across all observed uses
hence learning place through statistical sampling
since no feedback about its learning
second known generally involves active agents learning process cues provide feedback
learning been applied design system communication game experiments
despite empirical evidence most part learning
perspective very too since issue signaling no signaling involved learning process requires only observation some elements e g theory
many different computational two been proposed literature
example learning whereas
however statistical analysis learning algorithm problem single object study effects parameters those models been usually limited time evolution some measure communication accuracy population
although at first learning may one less context not any comparison between two learning scenarios
fact show limit very large learning
paper study models learning main two classical
here between objects words rather than between structures
more complete would involve first i e then see eg
