although not any previous work problem point view statistical machine learning at least rather basic problem relevant various practical learning scenarios
one important domain detection linear data relevant learning
learning fact many real world classification problems samples much obtain than examples
there develop tools samples improve quality sample based
utility data classification depends some relationship between data distribution class data points see point
common type between data classes through regions data distribution
support vector example algorithm uses low density assumption
small error data at same time wide respect data sample
another area play significant role analysis clustering stability
recent work analysis clustering stability found close relationship between stability clustering data density along lower more stable clustering
algorithm family probability distributions input finite sample generated some distribution output through low density t

particular consider family all distributions over continuous density functions
investigate two algorithms convergence over family probability distributions consistency
convergence prove general negative result no algorithm any fixed convergence rates terms sample
negative result even case where data domain
consistency e g rates depend distribution prove two natural algorithms choose parameter depending sample size output empirical weight algorithms choose
