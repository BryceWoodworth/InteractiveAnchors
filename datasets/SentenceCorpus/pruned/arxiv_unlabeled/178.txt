general learning agents cycle through sequences observations actions rewards
other hand learning small finite state markov decision processes
so far performed human state representation out observations \ reduce agent framework
before search need objective criterion
main article develop criterion
i also various into one learning algorithm
more dynamic bayesian networks developed article evolutionary algorithms selection selection
introduction
general agents perform well wide range environments
among approaches learning most directly same goal
general agent environment rewards
objective much reward possible
most if not all problems framework
environmental class finite state markov decision processes well
continuous states function approximation others been considered but algorithms much more
any case work still state representation out observations
even if potentially useful been found usually not clear one will turn out better situations where know model
into unknown environment
while image features potentially useful cannot know ones will actually useful
before representation need objective criterion
at any point time if criterion effective only depend agents past experience
main article develop criterion
unknown environment experience
so data past experience at hand cannot generate samples since model not given need learned itself there no
regression classification maximum likelihood been used model selection
far how apply them
do not about observations but rewards
rewards depend states but states arbitrary sense they functions data
indeed our derived cost function cannot length
