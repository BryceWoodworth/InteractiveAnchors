inference simple consistent set observations
there large body research inference within theory
however there little known inference graph
paper take further step direction work within framework graph
specifically given set graph whether not there graph rule generate obtain
previous results set instead
leads consider more involved graph rules
introduction
inference also called general research where one consistent given set possible outcomes
hence one instead power one given generated output
especially respect see eg however relatively little known graph
inference graph considered uses their developed
approach inference within framework graph natural class graph
there characterized given set graphs graph whether not there graph one rule able generate graphs obtain
research result case where graphs instead
generalization requires one number
most one generated graph depends order generated space constraints results but found extended version
