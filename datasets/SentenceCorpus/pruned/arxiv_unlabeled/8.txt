introduction
will require algorithms learn direct experience obtained visual input
systems provide source information but structure space e g environments not most current learning approaches
environments characterized regions represent physical objects objects visual field
there two approaches used existing algorithms real world 1 state space fixed adaptive 2 using function basis functions memory
fixed introduce while adaptive ones scale state space
neural networks relatively global functions not like fixed methods require knowledge appropriate local scale
methods use explicitly new
methods more our because they local models principle approximate functions but typically short because using fixed they assume sampling density state space
fixed because points both together its
if instead use fixed number effect using variable arbitrary important state space where most needed model local dynamics
use approach appropriate metric needed determine provide most relevant information what do given situation
structure space learning algorithm must also fact provide sufficient information determine where problem what action best take
some form memory needed identify underlying environment states only
paper present algorithm called continuous sequence memory algorithm state sequence memory more general case
like all data environment but uses continuous metric history allows used real environments without prior space
important work amount knowledge about structure environment available
typically learning simulation then resulting policy real
accurate model real environment only when simple used while models make policy difficult
must learn directly real world
furthermore since data real world algorithm should efficient state space without amount required different state space case even most approaches even metric state
