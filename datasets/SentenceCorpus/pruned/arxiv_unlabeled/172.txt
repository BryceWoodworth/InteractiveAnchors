past few years problem been made clustering i e clustering input matrix clustering
like more general problems also associated optimization
researchers developed approximation algorithms more recently also clustering
however there no approximation algorithms clustering
paper derive first our knowledge methods important clustering settings
also prove approximation factor clustering arbitrary
through experiments evaluate characteristics our method show also practical impact
introduction
data points into clusters problem
problem input data points vectors into clusters while their corresponding problem
however simple used obtain local exist since long time
because its wide importance problem been several
specific examples relevant paper clustering where instead one distance functions see both special cases where set input vectors matrix one clusters obtain while clustering clustering especially version based where one clusters along various input
problems too used heuristics perform well but do not provide theoretical at best local
type clustering e problems group together input vectors into clusters while exist several algorithms approximate optimal solution
more
contrast approximation algorithms clustering much less studied
only two very recent both special case both similar approaches obtain their approximation
both prove approximation additional factor binary matrices norm objective factor real matrices
all factors approximation clustering either
paper upon obtain approximation algorithms clustering arbitrary
latter result particular interest norm based clustering may generalization
focus clustering
additional relevant found while known problem clustering more
