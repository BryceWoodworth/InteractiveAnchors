introduction
models often describe novel information process but characteristics underlying process only if at all related underlying source information
time series models been developed using data but methods also one key source financial
our objective here show classification techniques allow much more analysis impact
empirical studies examine among others who showed there no significant average
similar studies were who find significant i e
effects also observed patterns demonstrated
findings tend demonstrate given future not while
impact also been studied
example studied interest rate following showed within one major
into single variable found no correlation correlation
however into variable model found significant predictive power
findings
results were further type
most common techniques forecasting often based models above
example
see models various other applications
machine learning techniques neural networks support vector also been used
neural networks used options support vector used using
here show information used predict relatively high accuracy
consistent however direction not found
form classification problem where positive if at some fixed time after made
support vector used solve classification problem using both
furthermore use multiple kernel learning predictive features increase classification performance
classification problem machine learning among many others show significantly methods
were used do classification using
taken several sources
classification used when at

support vector were also used using do classification using
classification also been used directly predict see systems use
recently used predict if large important then into variable used model similar
use support vector regression based
they found after over methods did not use
rules genetic another way financial systems
rules using based extended available information
methods were used rules based
our here
first predicted using classification techniques similar
given predict whether not will occur next using past
algorithm uses predict whether up within bounds within
they consider subset years used here
our experiments analyze at many demonstrate significant initial
second information time series significantly classification performance using multiple kernel learning
use method solve resulting problem
particularly efficient problems where objective function evaluate but whose set simple so
furthermore because does not achieve higher targets than other methods
paper follows
section classification problem solve here provides results using using either features
section multiple kernel learning framework algorithm used solve resulting optimization problem
finally use prediction performance
