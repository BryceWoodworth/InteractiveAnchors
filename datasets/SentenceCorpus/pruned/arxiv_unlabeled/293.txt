learning appropriate distance critical problem image classification
work propose technique learning distance metric
one primary learning metric matrix remains positive
used but does not scale well
instead based key observation any positive matrix into linear positive combination matrices
thus uses positive matrices within efficient learning process
resulting method does not require various types constraints
experiments various datasets show proposed algorithm those methods terms classification accuracy time
introduction
been goal learn appropriate distance metric image classification problems using simple efficient algorithms
distance essential many critical algorithms means clustering kernel regression example
show work how metric learned among training data
distance distance positive matrix
therefore typically methods learning distance result
discuss problem setting well learning matrix
if let represent set points training data set constraints upon relative between points where measures distance between
case distance
distance between two vectors matrix
learn matrix
constraints those above often when known same class data points while different classes
some cases comparison constraints much obtain than either class between data elements
example at close assumed same person without individual identified
search results search according allows natural into set constraints
being development number methods learning distance rely upon
approach number however now discuss reference problem learning matrix set constraints upon
relevant work others
proposed learn metric clustering using convex optimization
two similarity set set
algorithm distance between points set under distance between points similarity set
component analysis large learn metric consistency large at different classes
been shown performance among most distance metric learning algorithms
work directly our work
instead using loss use loss function order derive optimization procedure
hence despite similar our algorithm optimization
while more similar support vector our algorithm upon
many cases difficult find global matrix

only know when
contrast both parameters
also like
