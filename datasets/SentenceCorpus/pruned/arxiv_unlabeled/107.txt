concept information exists also problems no underlying stochastic model information representation instance information algorithm genome
introduced notion entropy information binary about unknown value variable
current paper following what relationship between information about description complexity
there notion cost information
there how efficient information
answer questions extended new concept information similar approximation theory introduced
information any input source eg general both single common formula
application space binary functions considered
introduction
measure information
considered three approaches
probabilistic approach entropy stochastic settings where represented random variable
setting entropy object information one object about another well defined
here necessary view object finite binary stochastic process
while often been used instance measure information some markov process not modeling finite objects provides natural universal representation information states what real there example how much information



some probability distribution set
other hand must assume individual form random sequence stochastic out over distance several
questions introduce notion information finite binary
defined length program
been later developed into complexity field
approach investigated another stochastic measure information object
here taken any finite space objects
where all taken respect
if value known then much entropy
let general finite domain consider set all values pairs
entropy defined where \ some } \
consider based defined then entropy given defined
information about
may view information set about another set
case let domain set pairs information defined
will representation information between sets

many applications input only information about unknown value
instance problems involve analysis algorithms classes structures sets binary vectors functions finite domain search made some optimal set based only information
one area statistical pattern recognition where unknown target i e pattern classifier based information finite sample some
information particular set form possible
example let positive consider domain
let set all binary functions
power set family all sets
all properties sets i e property set whose elements
property set
know unknown target function
any information about may expressed reduce search space
been problem value general learning see
framework may basis
let possible properties object represent unknown target may any
information then represented certain properties sets contain target
input some subset certain property
principle should value information about unknown value
however its current form not general since requires target fixed set knowledge
see set property
consider all property
hence may first consider but some useful information now consider two properties corresponding sets
most sets small while sets large
property more than since knowledge set should take average less additional information particular set known order
if above let then both properties
provides information associated possible sets
structural information cannot represented
