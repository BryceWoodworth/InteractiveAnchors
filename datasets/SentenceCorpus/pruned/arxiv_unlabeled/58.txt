introduction
sequential decision problem decision sequence actions
after each action decision some loss depending response state environment its goal its loss over certain time
setting considered here no probabilistic assumption made how losses corresponding different actions generated
particular losses may depend previous actions decision whose goal perform well relative set reference any possible behavior environment
more aim decision achieve same average per loss best
research into problem see example some basic results new life following work et al
results show any loss function if decision past losses all then possible construct algorithms perform any possible behavior environment almost well best
more per loss algorithms at most large best any loss function where number decision game
number makes possible obtain bounds even if very large
certain situations decision only limited knowledge about losses all possible actions
example often natural assume decision know only loss corresponding action made no information about loss would had made different decision
problem was considered setting et al who algorithm whose regret difference average loss best
note compared full information case described above where losses all possible actions revealed decision there factor performance bound bound if number large
another example limited information case efficient decision problem see too state environment so decision losses all possible actions only limited number times
recent result shows case if decision losses times during length then achieve average loss relative best
many applications set certain structure may construct efficient decision algorithms
algorithms been interest computational learning theory
problem at al
more complete
paper study problem example classes attention literature its many applications including among others communication see eg et al \ adaptive design source see et al
problem graph given whose weights change arbitrary manner decision each between two given weight weights its small possible
efficient solutions time space complexity number rather than number latter typically being number been given full information case where each weights all revealed after been see example et al
setting only weights just weights chosen revealed decision
if one general algorithm et al \ resulting bound will too large practical use because its number
other hand using special graph structure problem number performance bound
they average predictor algorithm generalization setting when only weights available algorithm
however bounds obtained number significantly than bound et al \
consider model i e losses depend previous actions prove bound expected regret
give algorithm than however obtain bound order expected regret
paper provide algorithm et al \ above approaches performance bound number at rate number increases
achieve bound model losses all chosen available after making decision
also discuss case considered only total loss i e losses chosen known decision
exhibit simple algorithm regret high probability against
case remains open problem find algorithm whose loss number graph number
