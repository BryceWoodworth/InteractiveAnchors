introduction
many common data sets i e
example feature vectors different objects sequence different see eg different under different conditions different linear each corresponding distinct
data give problem linear modeling i e modeling data mixture
different algorithms been suggested problem different mathematical theories
example component analysis based uses information theory clustering uses clustering methods well analysis
other hand there also some heuristic approaches eg local
most method all algorithm any its
algorithm given data set into each well its best
more given parameters algorithm objective function }
practice function performed means algorithm
after example they may chosen one following two 1 clusters according determined at previous 2 least obtained clusters component analysis
procedure very fast at least local minimum
however practice local minimum often significantly than global minimum
result algorithm not accurate more recent linear modeling algorithms even case underlying linear general often when either large e g there large component
paper two
first one show order significantly improve robustness noise algorithm sufficient its objective function } average average
second goal online algorithm so data one point at time produce corresponding output
online procedure very different than also standard settings data not
indeed possible strategy will more often global minimum error than generalization accurate algorithm best
order address those propose algorithm
since special case where algorithm see eg minimum same energy function
algorithm stochastic strategy order provide online approximation best
its current only setting underlying linear not general ones
numerical experiments real data performance algorithm various
particular some standard algorithms cases large component relatively large intrinsic dimension
even database motion requires small intrinsic little noise few very well particular better than
because process more often global minimum than
paper follows
