contains three information datasets used testing machine learning
algorithms required values search results measured using standard measures depend only relative order results
many proposed algorithms linear classifier
contrast other algorithms define additional free variable each
allows fact results different
cost idea addition relatively few parameters
our approach simple used standard regression test
results reported algorithms
hence seems our approach other more complex
introduction


version 2 contains three information datasets used testing machine learning
algorithms required values search results measured using standard measures see designed way only relative order results
input learning problem where each vector standard features together
either binary relevant relevant very relevant
all reported algorithms used task rely fact corresponding same some sense each other
measures over where each function
example use pairs results same cost function but pairs results
following approach seems at first too compared since training information given why not simply linear classifier predict use prediction confidence
approach
response may depend
hypothesis define additional free variable each
allows fact results different
cost idea addition relatively few parameters
our approach simple used standard regression test data
work not first suggest dependent but most way address using linear classification before other should tested
based our judgment other reported algorithms used more our solution overall better given data
