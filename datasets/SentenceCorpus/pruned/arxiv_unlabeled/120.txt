present component analysis new algorithm clustering points based
key property algorithm
when input sample mixture two arbitrary algorithm sample only two components there exists contains most one almost other probability
best possible known results
components algorithm requires only there some every direction small
here define following two 1 average distance between point mean its component 2 average distance between point mean mixture
main result may also linear if standard small not needed estimate optimal
our main tools simple technique
call combination
introduction
present component analysis able standard
when matrix input distribution point set multiple then no second along any direction same
called
our call information settings
use technique give clustering algorithm points
when applied problem arbitrary samples algorithm known results
technique consider distribution set
distribution unknown way would like original
each point sample may matrix resulting point set
direction will greater direction other
see
instead process may also thought importance technique allows one one distribution another
case distribution over set where density function so points more } paper describe how apply method arbitrary order find set along
mixture classical concept pattern recognition
identified points according component distribution generated them hence all parameters mixture learned
what paper previous work learning our algorithm
indeed every mixture distribution learned using previously known algorithm there linear condition number algorithm
components our algorithm best possible all previous results clustering
requires there where components small every direction see section
condition terms used field pattern recognition data
because our algorithm makes possible much larger set than had been possible previously
first step our algorithm place mixture position see section via
effect making i e one same means components they only general position any mixture
algorithm close uses them without
since after standard no additional information
before more describe relevant related work
