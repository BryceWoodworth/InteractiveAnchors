introduction
probabilistic inference data form finite set words according fixed unknown distribution called stochastic
then goal estimate distribution some class probabilistic models probabilistic same hidden markov models
limit
however our knowledge there exists no efficient inference algorithm able whole class stochastic generated
most previous use probabilistic
other hand probabilistic particular cases stochastic generated special cases rational call rational stochastic
been used inference exact learning model but not probabilistic inference
let us design class rational stochastic over
when class stochastic generated parameters
but when obtain greater classes provide several at least one elements may significantly smaller representation advantage learning elements normal representation while normal do not exist parameters directly related probabilities some natural events form estimated stochastic when field rational series over form vector space efficient linear techniques used rational stochastic
however class there exists no subset
moreover class close stochastic may find whose associated rational series negative values not global weight may not defined
however show strongly design algorithm any target given sample according will finite but number normal representation
moreover within time size input number parameters classical statistical rates convergence
however before target output close target but do not stochastic
question what do how use them probabilistic inference
show since algorithm at normal representation target output they 1 i e
defined without any shown learning
given any series stochastic not rational but property any
our despite fact no class class rational stochastic used stochastic
classical stochastic rational series section
study example shows representation rational stochastic real parameters may very
introduce our inference algorithm section show strongly limit
study properties output section show they define rational series used stochastic estimates target
