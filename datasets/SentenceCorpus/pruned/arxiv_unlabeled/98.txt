markov random used model high distributions number applied
much recent interest been structure independent samples markov random
analyze simple algorithm underlying graph markov random field nodes maximum degree given observations
show under conditions graph high probability using samples where depend local interactions
most local interaction order
our results optimal function up constant depending local interactions
our results first results general models model
furthermore provide time bound
cases where measure graph correlation time all fixed
also discuss effect samples show long noise level low our algorithm effective
other hand construct example where large noise even noise interactions
finally show some simple cases models hidden nodes also
introduction
paper consider problem graph structure markov random field independent distributed samples
markov random provide very general framework high distributions observations much recent interest particular biology see eg related
