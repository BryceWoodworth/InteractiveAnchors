introduction
under network environment networks one important problems stable
often situation analyze their networks
they may into result analysis where tools usually some functions
example etc \ been widely used among world wide long years
tools usually numbers etc
would often make their combination their experience
case forecasting rule not those field statistics statistical point view
other hand researchers field been analysis models
probabilistic approach one field
fact distribution not always because its nature etc
therefore conditions good models structures nature at least
furthermore another models structure forecasting
point parameter estimation often performed at first under assumption then estimated parameter parameter model
approach been field statistics statistical point view
however estimated parameter constant parameter not always especially forecasting problems
because there often no assumptions under parameter estimation model always future unknown data set
bayesian approach one alternatives point
bayesian approach probability distribution parameter assumed prior distribution
if new data observed then theorem prior distribution parameter distribution then distribution data
recently approach been widely applied many forecasting problems especially field information etc
order take bayesian approach statistical decision theory important theoretical framework statistical point view
taking above factors into account paper would bayesian forecasting i e time model
bayesian forecasting time parameter model been proposed certain class parameter function
however not yet been discussed about any predictive function parameter
paper would define type function parameter obtain optimal prediction
then its would real data
model time degree real constant constant would play important role paper
another feature forecasting value obtained simple under known
general theorem often results large
however certain combination parameter distribution its function problem
point not only theoretical cost but also real analysis tools
paper
section some forecasting model time distribution
section shows some analysis examples real data approach section their
finally section paper
