improve accuracy base data while
among them data

data learning highly
methods
introduction
learning number base then
combined prediction achieve strong generalization ability
effective
methods been proposed
etc most methods work under setting
where training examples known
many tasks however
training examples available while their would
learning major data together
training data improve learning performance without human

data
contrast learning
learning only few work been study

was different
learning learning
learning
able performance strong
using multiple so there no need use while
learning able performance strong
data so there no need use multiple
however
there several important why learning
learning actually among important one
data possible help among base
following
generalization error related average
generalization error base among base
generally
lower average generalization error higher average accuracy base
higher among base better
previous
methods work under setting achieve high average accuracy
high using training set
however high
accuracy high may
example two
performance training set they would not since there
no difference between their predictions training examples
thus increase
accuracy one classifier
however when data might
find two actually make different predictions data
would
important design
example given two pairs if know all them accuracy training data then there
will no difference taking either
however if find make same predictions data
while make different predictions some data then will know
should better
so contrast previous methods
focus both high accuracy high using only data use
data would open direction new methods
paper propose data
approach
experiments show using data
much better performance than its does not consider
data
moreover also highly performance other
methods
