rules represent significant relationships between items
concept rule represent much class associations rules
rules associations between properties related objects

propose new support confidence rules frequency
prove frequency standard probability property
introduction
one data relationships data
rules relationships sufficient frequency but not always
example may case not all over \ p p p p p
our frequency previous work rules setting
rules
approach system special class rules allows
our concept rules features addition universal
thus one paper extended rule
our approach previous work previous approaches assume given target base set support
contrast define natural base set support
approach sets given rather than respect fixed set
thus second main paper new support rules our extended
paper follows
first review basic database domain
then introduce concept define frequency class
provides basis notion rule support rule
compare rule system
section important properties define them shows they property frequency no greater than frequency its
