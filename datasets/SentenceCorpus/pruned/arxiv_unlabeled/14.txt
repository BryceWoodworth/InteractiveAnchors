adaptation rule vector algorithms convergence generated sequence depends existence properties function called energy function defined
our aim investigate conditions existence function class algorithms initial algorithms
results presented here previous studies including
our work shows energy function not always potential but at least limit series potential functions call
also shows large number existing vector algorithms developed neural networks into
framework define way study convergence all corresponding adaptation rules at theorem direction
also demonstrate energy function but not potential general
energy function associated not potential general
introduction
vector theory set order following function called } where probability density defined
focus stochastic approaches where at each time step probability density function according using adaptation } where adaptation step using parameter generally over time taken 1 without general results function particular each vector algorithm
here focus functions
main field vector whether adaptation rule not stochastic along energy function i e whether energy function not potential
one hand if energy function potential then convergence their adaptation rule minimum energy function well particular stochastic optimization framework paper
example energy function associated algorithm stochastic version algorithm et al potential long continuous
other hand if energy function not potential then very few known about convergence corresponding adaptation rule
example several results shown continuous density corresponding vector adaptation rule algorithm does not stochastic along global energy function convergence although being observed practice out very difficult prove not most been out rule
all vector algorithms study paper algorithm will see section
know algorithms practice value their energy functions they associated not
however theoretical study their convergence not available so they heuristics
among all algorithms particular attention
been its authors associated global potential general hence adaptation rule
propose not true
shows study convergence all algorithms still its present work
paper propose framework all algorithms
study framework demonstrate energy function associated algorithms not potential general
also demonstrate energy function class functions potential functions special case
energy functions within class called
results obtain do not depend probability density function give first step why all algorithms shown framework practice their associated energy function whether they not
framework should open up further general study convergence properties all algorithms contains at
section 2 present framework study
section define function series potential define concept cellular series
section give main theorem states energy function framework
consider show not always
discuss convergence corresponding adaptation rule
