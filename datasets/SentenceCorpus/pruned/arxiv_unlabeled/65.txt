introduction
modeling information among objects represented graphs important problem data analysis machine learning
many data sets contain observations
example literature interaction data proteins physical interaction
settings often hidden attributes objects observed measurements properties
example might clustering predict functions protein degree
data over individual objects data classical assumptions typically made machine learning statistics
fact observations their very nature statistical analysis
there history research end
one problem been studied clustering objects group structure based observed patterns interactions
standard clustering methods eg mixture models not data because they assume objects independent given their
stochastic adaptation mixture modeling data
model each object relationships between objects corresponding pair clusters
via inference model one identify objects play their relationships each other
model stochastic where objects known
recent model assumption clusters via bayesian based process prior
stochastic each object only one other words play single role
real life not more data
example when protein social different different functional social may apply thus protein may according different they possible play
paper assumption develop model data
models recent years modeling data where single assumption within data point
they been applied many domains analysis image processing regulation population
model each observation multiple clusters rather than single via vector
data different clusters its different aspects different underlying words each
particularly natural idea data where objects multiple influence their relationships others
will demonstrate approach data us describe interaction between objects multiple
example some interactions may one other interactions may another function
existing models not appropriate data because they assume data independent given their vectors
data where each object described its relationships others would like assume vectors help relationships each object
assumptions models do not apply
paper develop models data develop fast inference algorithm inference estimation demonstrate application our technique large scale protein interaction networks social networks
our model multiple objects exhibit interaction others relationships between those observed interaction matrix

application protein interaction network tests what extent our model reduce data while information about proteins used analyses section
