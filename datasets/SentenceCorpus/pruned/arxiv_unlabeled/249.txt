proposed algorithm may over entropy previously theory
primary use entropy model
however also used appear maximization algorithms
introduction
efficient function important many including signal processing
when factor graph representation function available then exact factor graph
fact number algorithms special cases
may arbitrary
paper propose use entropy resulting algorithm will called
entropy was introduced et al relative entropy between probabilistic
paper into factor graphs algorithms
primary use entropy model factor graph fixed observations
main prior work subject et al main point present paper prior work terms
however also used appear maximization algorithms new
paper follows
section review over
section introduce entropy
algorithm described section applications described section
