large systems important agents learn but learning algorithms generally do not scale
alternative approach find classes games where simple efficient algorithms
shown learning large games if dynamics
two features identified improve convergence
first rather than making learning more difficult more agents actually many settings
second agents statistical information about behavior others significantly reduce number observations needed
introduction
distributed systems determine how agent system should because optimal behavior depends preferences actions others
natural approach agents use learning algorithm
many learning algorithms been proposed including simple strategy play algorithms
however discuss section existing algorithms generally large distributed systems
distributed system each agent limited view actions other agents
algorithms require example strategy chosen every agent cannot
furthermore size distributed systems requires fast convergence
may use system short time conditions system change over time so practical algorithm system convergence rate number agents
existing algorithms tend provide performance even
finally large number agents system there will noise
agents will make will
even if no agent changes his strategy there still noise agent payoffs
example will different agents underlying network may effect between agents
learning algorithm robust noise
while finding algorithm arbitrary games may difficult distributed systems characteristics make problem
first they involve large number agents
having more agents may make learning all there more possible interactions
however advantage outcome action typically depends only what other agents do
makes outcomes robust noise
having large number agents also make less useful agent influence better policy learn optimal response
contrast small number agents agent learning agents into outcome
second distributed systems often does not who does but rather how many agents do
example when there experience single agent does not depend who but how many being
finally most distributed system system game agents
us different perspective than most work game given
do not need solve problem finding efficient algorithm all games
instead find algorithms work classes games where us means type games system might agents play
games should since would design system where decisions influence other agents ways
section show learning robust information class games
algorithm agents game into series
each agent uses fixed strategy
at end agent his strategy next strategy had average reward current
prove under appropriate conditions large system will approximate dynamics despite errors
games where dynamics our theorem will play approximate
contrast previous results where convergence scales number agents our theorem convergence finite amount time number agents
while assumption dynamics strong one many games under dynamics including games games best
et al observed convergence dynamics often property games humans design
moreover convergence dynamics assumption than common assumption made mechanism design literature games interest strategies each agent strategy optimal no what other agents do
simulation results presented section show convergence fast system agents few
furthermore identify two factors determine rate quality convergence
one number having more agents makes noise more consistent so agents learn using observations
other agents statistical information about behavior other convergence order
indeed even statistical information about agent behavior should relatively obtain significantly improve performance
