propose simple strategies sequential decision prediction under when decision does not past outcomes but rather feedback signal
proposed strategies consistent sense they achieve best possible average reward among all fixed actions
was who first existence consistent
presented here first consistency
moreover proposed algorithms efficient
also bounds rates convergence
case feedback signals rates optimal up terms
introduction
sequential decision problems decision predict outcome certain unknown process at each time instance action
depending outcome predicted event action taken decision reward
very often probabilistic modeling underlying process difficult
situations prediction problem game between decision environment
when showed decision strategy outcome sequence average reward high reward one could empirical distribution outcome sequence
strategies called consistent
prove result assumed decision full past outcomes
case full information case
however many important applications decision limited information about past elements sequence predicted
various models limited feedback been considered literature
best known them problem only its own reward but not actual see
example shown consistency case well
sequential decision problems like ones considered paper been studied different under various games regret learning prediction individual sequences sequential prediction
different differ
used learning
general introduction sequential prediction problem
paper consider general model information available general given function outcome decision
well under what conditions consistency see
possible after problem reward matrix expressed linear function matrix expected feedback signals
however condition not always then natural question what best performance decision
question was who characterized average reward all possible outcome sequences almost sense
however not
uses due seems his method give efficient prediction algorithms
efficient strategy special case where feedback function action nature was shown
general case strategy short average reward characterized
goal paper develop efficient general prediction problem under achieve best possible performance
introduce several forecasting strategies some specific properties problem at hand
four cases according whether feedback signal only depends outcome both outcome action whether feedback signal not
design different prediction algorithms all four cases
also obtain performance bounds rates convergence terms number prediction game
case feedback signals rates optimal up factors
random feedback signal case do not know if possible construct significantly smaller regret
example prediction problem both networks
networks communication between multiple decision
often difficult between decision
particular several allow multiple agents use same may each other
more specifically consider system where multiple agents choose data at any given time
quality each may different other using other may affect
agent may choose use how much power every transmission
agent between amount power transmission cost having its only
agent may not feedback how much data were base even if feedback often much higher communication
instead agent other agents
however since agent far other agents information about chosen other agents amount power they used
online learning problem
paper follows
next section prediction problem investigate introduce target best reward notion regret
section describe some properties key function defined section
function possible average reward given vector observations needed our analysis
section consider special case when actions do not influence feedback signal moreover
case full information case obtain regret bound order high probability where number prediction game
section study random feedback signals but still only determined outcome
here able obtain regret order
most general case section
introduced there regret order
finally section show may case feedback signals known optimal see
