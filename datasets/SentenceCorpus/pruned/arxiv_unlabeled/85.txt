data analysis new complex data considered like example data functional data data data


context classical data analysis knowledge discovery based not used because input not vectors
paper present application real world data using
end propose data classification data
introduction
introduced neural network method both clustering properties
considered algorithm high data space lower dimension generally 2 called
input data into clusters while their
its most similar algorithm dynamic clustering method without therefore without
data analysis new complex data considered most data data structure data distributions functional data etc data etc
context classical data analysis based not used because input not vectors
order solve problem several methods considered depending type data example functional data
however those methods not general adaptation every data analysis algorithm resulting data needed
based notion concept not many complex data
paper propose adaptation data alternative solution
our goal algorithm allow its measures rather than data
end take work
apply method only each type data necessary so complex data
