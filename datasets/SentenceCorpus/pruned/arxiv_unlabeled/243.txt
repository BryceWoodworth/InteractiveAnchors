problem signals first studied become against many learning algorithms been tested
both training set test set although different
moreover complete set learning test patterns together also
give weights sets may used compare results found other algorithms
introduction
become current practice test performance learning algorithms problems
underlying difficulty tests general problems not well making thus whether better solution one found exists
signals classification introduced et al widely used test machine learning algorithms
problem classifier if given was produced same environment
contains defined real values their corresponding class
among patterns usually used determine classifier parameters through procedure called learning
then classifier used class patterns patterns used estimate generalization error produced learning algorithm
applied neural learning algorithm
algorithm hidden one after other number training errors
each hidden simple binary learning algorithm
