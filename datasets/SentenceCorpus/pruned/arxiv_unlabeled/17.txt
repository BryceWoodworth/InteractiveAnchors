fundamental problem what
problem especially when need consider systems significantly different humans
paper approach problem following take number well known human been given their essential features
then produce general measure arbitrary
measure concept machine sense
introduction
most us when see but not how define measure
others our past people
approach highly subjective
more approach would use one many standard tests available
popular tests when applied consistent results power predict future performance individuals many tasks
however while tests work well humans if measure other new machine learning algorithm they
one response problem might develop specific tests specific just tests differ tests
while well when testing humans different when need measure different each other terms their cognitive environments they so
measure systems way must step particular systems underlying what measure
need notion particular systems
difficulty
consider example memory numerical tasks appear some tests were human
now know tasks machine thus do not test
indeed even task been reduced search
our concept what
how then develop concept all systems
any proposed must human well other consistent way
should not limited any particular set environments should limited any specific biological neurons
should based fundamental so over time
furthermore measure should expressed objective
paper approaches problem following way
section consider range human been well known
most common essential features use them
section then framework use construct our measure
framework defined section
section use our developed produce
section short
paper
shown measure presented here fact order relation theory optimal universal agent
long version paper being give proposed measure machine its relation other tests much more treatment

however will value our aim better our understanding what subjective concept
