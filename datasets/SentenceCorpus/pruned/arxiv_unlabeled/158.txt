consider task learning classifier feature space set classes when features into independent feature sets
show fact used represent original learning task terms 1 learning classifier 2 learning distribution feature set
fact learning because task samples
present experimental evaluation idea two real world applications
introduction
learning occur when large data relatively small sample accurate
high cost data data many application domains interest learning recent years
show feature leads simple learning algorithm
when feature set into two independent sets show original learning problem terms problem learning predictor one other
latter class variable
since predictor learned only samples effective algorithm results
next section present simple yet result our learning algorithm call learning based
present examples approach present special case our approach used applications section
then examine related previous work our algorithm among previous approaches learning
present empirical evaluation two real world applications where required assumptions our algorithm
