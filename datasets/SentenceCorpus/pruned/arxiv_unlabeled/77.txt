method forecasting applied problem prediction binary outcomes
out forecasting not only algorithm but also case whose depends paper prediction continuous
introduction
there many known techniques prediction following see eg see eg related potential methods see eg related recently developed technique forecasting see eg
forecasting probability see eg measure universal
see general review prediction
paper technique forecasting prediction simple case binary outcomes goal prediction free agents called who choose any predictions at each step
will performance type } where number constant depending loss over first loss over first see
been shown theorem algorithm general loss functions short optimal value constant goal result was based results theorem 1 theorem 1 large number theorem paper forecasting also same performance
whether goal depends loss function used performance
necessary sufficient condition loss function should see
first consider two specific most important examples loss loss function loss function
those two they do not require
section general result arbitrary loss functions
state theorem form needed paper
technique forecasting also who their depend continuous manner paper prediction
not clear at all
result similar results theorem more detailed comparison will given
useful game theory where known prediction small regret
more example useful humans tend give too i e close 1 therefore useful human would predictions less ones according expected
