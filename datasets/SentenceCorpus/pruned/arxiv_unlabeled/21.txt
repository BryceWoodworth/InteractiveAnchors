given two probability measures set sequences consider question when one measures predicts other when probabilities certain sense when one measures chosen generate sequence
question may considered problem sequence prediction its most general given class probability measures does there exist measure predicts all measures class
address problem find some conditions local sufficient prediction several different known sufficient prediction
also some open questions direction finding conditions classes measures prediction possible
introduction
let sequence some finite generated some probability measure
having observed first predict what probability next being each
task applications forecasting prediction data
if measure known then best one make outcome sequence probabilities given
other hand if known about distribution sequence then no prediction possible since any predictor there measure probability every step
thus one attention some class measures
was first address question sequence prediction his being know every years what probability will
suggested assume probability same every trials independent each other
thus considered task sequence prediction when true measure family \ measures binary
predicting measure suggested was where number
probabilities measure true probabilities almost under any measure
approach problem predicting any e g \ measure
moreover measure was predicting arbitrary measure
probabilities true ones average where average taken over time sense almost any measure
however was shown same work there no measure probabilities true ones s \ every
thus see problem predicting outcomes measure two prediction prediction average sense prediction each step solution exists only problem
but what if measure sequence not
different assumption one make measure sequence
suggested measure predicting any probability measure
key observation here class all probability measures let us
bayesian predictor class measures any set where weights positive one
best predictor measure measure itself
bayesian predictor simply average all measures class classes possible
was shown probabilities probabilities almost any measure
fact special case more general though without convergence rate result states if measure continuous respect measure then total variation almost
convergence total variation means prediction very strong sense convergence probabilities arbitrary events not just next outcome prediction arbitrary fast
since every set every each continuous respect
thus problem sequence prediction certain classes measures class all measures class all measures was often literature
although classes measures often applications assumptions does problem at hand not practical predicting measure all measures itself
moreover able solutions sequence prediction problem problems active learning where outcomes sequence may depend actions predictor one understand better under conditions problem sequence prediction
particular active learning assumption does not since predictions although markov assumption often studied
thus following general questions address present classes measures sequence prediction possible
under conditions does measure predict measure
seen questions many particular there many prediction considered almost convergence probabilities convergence average etc
literature sequence prediction questions their full not much attention
one research result above states if continuous respect then predicts total variation distance
question whether given class measures prior over class measures probabilities bayesian mixture class t
true probabilities almost any measure
question considered since authors provide necessary sufficient conditions measure given mixture class t
under prediction possible
major difference general questions above do not assume measure our class measures
large classes measures may not measure over rather question whether measure used prediction exists
address general questions following observation
was bayesian mixture class measures any any set where constant
condition than assumption sufficient prediction very strong sense
since prediction sense e g \ convergence probabilities let us make measure measure if all first under what conditions does predicts
if any then any measure continuous respect measure first trials continuous t
each moreover any measure some found
example if \ measure parameter any other measure then
thus know if then predicts very strong sense whereas not prediction
will show any sufficient prediction sense convergence expected
any also example sufficient almost prediction average i e \ sense
however prediction every step negative any there exists pair measures but does not predict sense almost convergence probabilities
thus situation similar predicting any prediction possible average but not every step
note also measure shown any \ measure generalization predicting all measures memory given them
thus sense predicting classes measures where constant via local predicting \ measures
another way follows
mixture being many measures some their predicting properties
general predictive properties under
particular if two two classes measures question whether predictor two classes
answer question would improve our understanding how far class measures predicting measure exists extended without property second consider measure predicts some sense let some other measure e g \ predictor different class measures
does measure still predict
prediction quality does idea taking bayesian
under along strong prediction ability
was prediction sense convergence expected probabilities under
here find several prediction not under
thus address following two questions
sufficient prediction some sense under some conditions
if measure predicts measure some sense does measure also predict same sense where arbitrary measure
different prediction s \ convergence probabilities s \ convergence etc above two questions obtain not two but many different questions some answer positive some negative yet some open
paper follows
section necessary measures probability measures
section question whether sufficient prediction while section consider question predictor arbitrary measure
both also propose some open questions future research
section discuss some special cases questions considered also some related problems
