introduction
paper area research known universal prediction individual sequences see goal wide class prediction strategies
previous prediction strategies important classes markov continuous prediction strategies
paper consider against strategies
our main results existence prediction strategies markov strategies
idea transition continuous general classes was space functions most
idea was allow small not only along but also along when
was so space p allows us apply one algorithms prediction algorithm paper construct universal algorithm
section give main state our main results their given
