introduce new prediction each his own performance using loss function may change over time may different loss functions used other
goal perform better not much than each all
if loss functions used all rules all show forecasting algorithm same performance algorithm standard setting known optimal
result also applied case
case forecasting algorithm simple algorithm
introduction
consider problem online sequence prediction
process outcomes step step
at each step next outcome his prediction
then actual outcome revealed
quality prediction measured loss loss at step
prediction framework does not make any assumptions about process
performance compared performance several other called
at each step each his prediction then his own prediction based predictions at step predictions outcomes at all previous losses
there many algorithms review see
practical applications algorithms prediction loss function often problem
task may no natural measure loss concept prediction outcome better
thus one among several common loss functions example loss idea least methods loss information theory
similar issue when themselves prediction algorithms some losses
then when them according loss function
paper new version framework prediction where there no single fixed loss function but some loss function every
performance compared performance each according loss function
each almost well better than
prove known algorithm forecasting algorithm applied new setting same performance standard setting provided all loss functions rules only new all loss functions used must
all rules particular loss functions similar each other sense another framework our methods applied see eg
some known results case loss functions
simple possible binary outcomes predictions finite number
our results loss functions only
however results more general settings outcomes arbitrary prediction spaces many etc \ where methods work
