introduction
theories statistics often question prior
prior means subject who about perform statistical analysis about underlying process
yet subject would like available sample some statistical i e subject would like use data learn initial condition
situation very important often statistical analysis assumptions about problem interest thus approach statistics
fundamental question whether prior learning not
negative answer case his theory statistics based modeling through sets probability distributions
shows very general sense prior i e lead type amount observed data
at same time different state called does learning take place
subset functions random variables under see section
way prior still one some functions interest at same time learn data
fact learning possible under prior shown instance special case model
popular model based set used case inference data generated process
our aim paper investigate whether possible way out problem statistical inference conditions very
out setting made data generated process like but consider sets general not only used
interest fact sets appear play important role question modeling prior about random variable
key point sets made two
first well known principle second states if our prior event interest should not depend space event see section about two
later both order condition about random variable
if necessary sets should especially important subject who learn condition
our setting where variable under
means cannot so learn about only means another not variable related through known probability distribution
variable assumed sense its observed see section
considered made many real cases not possible directly value random variable instance when variable health result test
cases need use variable test order obtain information about original variable health
paper variable made process call process
using introduced give condition section related likelihood function shown sufficient learning about under prior
condition very general developed any set models thus including case very general probabilistic between
show then simple examples condition even most common statistical problems
order result important variables problems uncertainty
key point here processes if consider even when directly obtain value variable interest what actually obtain observation value rather than value itself
makes sense because practice process usually i e there very often could there always positive probability value another possible value thus observation error
if probability observation error very small consider one common bayesian model proposed learn under prior then there little difference between results provided variable model modeling process results provided model where observations assumed
process often practice between variable one not
but other hand if consider sets probability distributions model our prior instead single probability distribution particular if consider sets then there difference between variable model model where observations considered so learning may first model possible second
when sets probability distributions process may no even if probability observation error
shown sense example section where analyze our results special case
paper follows behavior determined presence set distributions
question distributions usually not considered when bayesian models single prior cannot out without
general present results hence about condition prior real applications statistics
may make sense consider research about subject models very states belief however than
might also involve idea both practice
