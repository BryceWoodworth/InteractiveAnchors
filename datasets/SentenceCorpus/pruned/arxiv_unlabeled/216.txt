introduction
central question paper how estimate probability given observation
all approaches problem require time
used approach predict probability versus all other each requires time per training example
another common approach learn function into probability estimate according where factor
computational difficulty solve problems
example one our experiments involves probabilistic prediction problem examples where any solution
