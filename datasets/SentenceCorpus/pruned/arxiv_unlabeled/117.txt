introduction
support vector become central binary classification problems
critical step support vector machine classification kernel matrix measures similarity between data points must positive because matrix data points kernel space
positive condition kernel matrices also known condition machine learning literature
classification problem then program
here present algorithm classification using i e kernel matrices using similarity measures not positive
our interest several observations
first certain similarity measures take advantage structure data often empirical classification performance
popular used support vector machine classification similarity matrices often so do not kernel space see particular application classification image classification using distance was discussed
similarity measures protein sequences yet provided useful positive those been into positive good empirical performance see example
distance similarity measures described various simple image also shown performance recognition
finally prove some condition numerical complexity exact positive kernel too high not positive kernel used instead see example
both cases our method allows us
our objective here derive efficient algorithms directly use similarity measures classification
our work follows recent results kernel learning see where kernel matrix learned linear combination given result explicitly positive
while problem algorithm solve case where kernel combination other
our setting here kernel matrix because part problem explicitly means complexity our method lower than classical kernel learning algorithms practice algorithm used who multiple kernel learning problem linear program solve technique similar method use here
