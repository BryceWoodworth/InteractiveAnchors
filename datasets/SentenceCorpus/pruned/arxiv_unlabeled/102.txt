introduction
algorithm popular maximum estimation
common problems where approach notion data sense data but much than
algorithm its situations where some experiments complete data related parameters more than measurements
problems where algorithm useful include among many others mixture data models etc
algorithm several properties
because complete data generally simple at each i only involves taking over distribution data given observations complete data estimation
moreover algorithm algorithm sense increases observed likelihood at each
finally under some additional conditions algorithm may shown point point where
note convergence maximum likelihood cannot general due possible presence multiple points
when processing large data sets data however algorithm due whole data available at each algorithm
there been strong interest online make possible estimate parameters data model without data
work consider online algorithms data models independent observations
approach see also section below online estimation follows method proposed using stochastic approximation algorithm where parameters after each new observation using data likelihood complete data information matrix
approach been used some many different applications see convergence was given
propose new online algorithm more original algorithm
particular each proposed algorithm into two where first one stochastic approximation version at information available observation second step program algorithm
addition proposed algorithm does not rely complete data information matrix two important practical point view evaluation information matrix no required convergence procedure does not rely assumption model data under actually generated model some unknown value parameter
contrast previous work provide analysis proposed algorithm also case where observations not assumed statistical model
particularly relevant case data models simple case used proposed online algorithm
finally shown additional use proposed approach points criterion between density observations model at rate optimal
