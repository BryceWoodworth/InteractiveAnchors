many where human understanding role knowledge data critical importance
within framework learning methods if used help human
methods aim been robust rules set training data most important ones linear regression rank techniques
algorithm good those methods
however was designed so only about numerical performance
thus propose some original method take into account
after original algorithm paper changes made original method then some results obtained problems
finally algorithm applied detection problem
introduction
learning methods models neural networks likely give results provided some constraints
while ability some applications prediction essential when human gain into complex problem e g biological processes evolution
explain why modeling become important research shown recent literature
even so given modeling not always same
some authors mean mathematical where structure developed systems leads every series about rule
others mean
present paper focused latter approach
small number consistent functions number rules system
methods provide set tools rules data limited subset rules
those methods were designed linear optimization but subject some conditions they used models
instance order model set rules rule } where sets associated variables given rule corresponding rule
let pairs data set where
pair above model output } used elements rule within rule function value
let us introduce rule firing
thus } been set provided given data set all data set
then allows model linear regression problem matrix form
matrix form sample output vector p firing matrix rule vector e error term
methods then used determine them optimal values order design order model data set
review use methods rules found
they into two main methods rules using matrix only others also use output do best
first family methods rank techniques particularly when input include sets
least technique second family allows rule selection based rule output
respect criterion good system why been widely used statistics also why particularly rule shown instance
aim present paper using method example results made without too much loss accuracy
number rule
into useful tools modeling regression problems knowledge data
thus they study there few available techniques objective knowledge classification problems
section how original
section learning will used our algorithm
section necessary respect constraints
next section algorithm applied problems compared original one reference results found literature
application presented section
finally give some future work
