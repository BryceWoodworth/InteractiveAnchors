given random binary sequence random variables instance one generated markov source order each state represented
let probability assume constant respect due
consider based model instance markov model order who sample sequence source
test performance sequence generated source its predictions every error occurs at time if prediction true value
sequence errors where error at time according whether event error occurs not
consider errors predicting only at times paper bound frequency s
introduction
basic theory finite markov since matrix stochastic i e elements any then probability distribution not unique
simple use also any distribution derived distribution
instance
all random binary sequences assumed according probability distribution
thus any probability expressed } let us } probability event at time
data assume source data sequence respect
consider model
its set parameters true unknown probability values between states where probability values according source distribution
them instance consider two states
corresponding transition probability based estimates where state number times number times there transition state
instance if then
thus frequency
note dependent random variables since markov may each state random number times they must
after training tested data
makes binary prediction based maximum probability defined current state then prediction } where defined state obtained transition i e if then
corresponding true probability value
note may expressed } independent random variables when vector
now prove will used section
let us particular sequence states corresponding sequence
show will
then since at every there only two types then not every sequence possible
instance if then state sequence but not
set state sequences
now show if then any other state sequence same states same number times different order must same probability
any state random variable whose value number state sequence random states
define number state sequence
since all state either then } where was defined above
let parameter define random variable
probability function parameter random variable then } fixed value event event
hence expressed } probability functions random variables
so event state sequence event generated source markov event its corresponding state sequence transition take particular values

also follows average independent trials taken transition state
distributed according distribution parameters
now problem setting under main result paper
problem setting let positive
let probability distribution based finite markov matrix second
all probability values measured according

after source binary sequence according

let obtained according
let model markov order probability making transition state
uses first estimate
let number times state
after training decision at state output if output
probability random variable parameters larger smaller than given smaller larger than
let
let
using tested data predicts output if
sequence where if
time corresponding predictions
note also input sequence hence selection rule certain
let assume model order now state main result paper
before make following effect training sequence length
increases class possible models hypothesis class size bound error sequence
effect model order
see increases hypothesis class increases size
effect length error sequence
less its frequency mean
effect between states source model
increases increases possible size
sequence become less dependent
