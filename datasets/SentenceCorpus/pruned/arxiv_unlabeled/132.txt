introduction
algorithms used online prediction decision making game
any algorithm based
at any step each its
performed
after losses rewards each environment
algorithm also some loss reward depending decision
goal algorithm perform almost well best long
prediction considered paper follows
asked perform sequential actions at times
at each time step results actions form their gains losses
after at step makes decision one
at end step same gain loss at step
use
let loss at time
given at time natural idea solve problem i e performed best past
following simple example shows perform much than each let current losses two
algorithm always prediction
method following was
method simple main result
they called algorithm type following
presented further algorithm class arbitrary weights adaptive learning rate
algorithm prediction n i t t t i seems too
consider some applications results paper
define two financial learning motion whose gains at any step not
application at our special interest games gains section
paper present some algorithm case large gains not
show general case gain any probabilistic prediction algorithm much than gain some
give lower bound gain any probabilistic algorithm general case prove our universal algorithm optimal also prove case when gains particular when they performance our algorithm close performance best
result some results above
