introduction
well known source statistical modeling
fact see 2 provides between probability distributions
if one full knowledge source statistics then one design optimal source
however practice source statistics known so one design universal perform within given class sources
universal too shown modeling given family sources source statistics via estimation long data sequence use knowledge appropriate
even settings e g class all sources universal amount probabilistic model source
direction among others problem statistical modeling parameter estimation model identification via universal
consider though relationship between modeling no so simple
one hand having full knowledge source statistics optimal
other hand some special cases e g
sources measure
sources measure not at all clear how statistical model source its via although shown recently empirical distribution source corresponding distribution problem source
not problem when but there situations one would like source identify its statistics at same time
instance adaptive control see eg parameters system estimated basis observation
consider stochastic setting state sequence random process whose statistics finite set parameters
via whose per use
then given time objective design obtain estimates both parameters state sequence possible
state problem general terms consider information source sequence random variables taking values
process distribution not but known some class
answer following two class respect given measure given structure e g all given rate all etc
other words does there exist optimal each
if answer question 1 positive way not only source but also identify its process distribution optimal
previous work two questions context sources parameter space subset some finite
shown under appropriate conditions measure source models there exist universal source identification whose between actual performance theoretical given function source estimation both length
each source parameters estimated
comparing convergence rate convergence rate optimal see there general identification
furthermore constant hidden increases model class measured dimension certain class source associated sources
main results
assumption rather many relevant model classes e g sources markov hidden markov processes
furthermore assumption parameter space may not always at least sense may not know
paper both assumptions study existence performance universal identification sources condition when sources assumed model class being open subset some finite
because parameter space not use performance functional between expected expected rate
our result under certain conditions measure model class there exist universal source identification length between actual performance optimal performance at length well source estimation at where dimension certain class decision regions source process distributions
result shows very terms both identification underlying model class dimension sequence
model class learn performance our because use source parameters learned past data how current
furthermore comparing rate at under our result whose universal not at identification see modeling some performance
