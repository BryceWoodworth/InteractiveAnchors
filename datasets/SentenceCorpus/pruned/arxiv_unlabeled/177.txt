most work computational modeling structure theory its structure
complex
introduce relation analysis order
between words using large among words
evaluate set problems based based common
performance problems
compare variety alternative approaches find they not able same level performance
introduction
when problem similar problems past so our knowledge past experience current problem
make between past situation current situation use knowledge
his computational modeling structure theory its structure most work modeling
source target
source more more known more whereas target relatively unknown
used knowledge source target
there two similarity similarity similarity
between attributes may terms
one large
relation two more
structure based similarity over based similarity
example able representation system source representation model target

note similarity
very different terms their very large very small
little similarity
other hand like
like
provides evidence rely similarity over similarity they
uses terms based similarity based similarity similarity mixture similarity
since use solve problems make predictions should focus structure especially attributes
between system model importance underlying structures
show used input between system
complex
they argue most work human who rather than } } their their recent work
system generate simple
system generate models
learning system generate natural
systems do not require input
however requires person who identify basic components them terms knowledge base derived
et al note contains more than they further order support
system requires physical model using methods
learning uses more than patterns were derived
still requires knowledge
work present paper effort complex
our approach analysis
call resulting algorithm relation
represent relation between two terms using vector elements derived pattern large
because derived does not require
only terms source terms target
given two uses among terms then between two
show input output between system model
although some human effort involved input less effort than requires its input contrast } } between system model may but our
potential practical application work task
