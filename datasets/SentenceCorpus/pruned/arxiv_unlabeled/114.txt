performance criterion situations when
cost expressed terms rather than rewards
discuss between simple regret

introduction
learning processes usually versus
since they information environment
able take good actions
key example
problem sequential decision
problem where at each one out
given stochastic reward at random
according distribution chosen
criterion given its regret
differences between expected reward best obtained rewards
good like between
our setting follows
may sample given number times not known
then asked output
his simple regret difference between
average payoff best average payoff obtained his
feature classical problem
phase evaluation phase
now why natural framework applications
first problems was given trials
case disease patients only
cost treatment
high associated reward would large negative value
important regret since test

however there exists test phase
phase one at regret rather
than regret test phase here several considered some quantitative like
performed

problem design strategies making best possible use available numerical
e g time order performance some decision-making task
occurs situations phase
not measured terms rewards but rather terms limited
example recent e g program
given time i e given amount times given
explore possible outcome sequences output decision
efficient search space obtained
some regret see instance
strategy strategy
however regret does not
way base strategies since simulation same all
options good ones
observation
was actually point notion simple regret work
related example maximization some function observed noise see eg
at point e g terms numerical financial
issue choose possible where value function
order good approximation maximum
problem considered here design adaptive strategies
making best use available order make most prediction
all
also out all examples considered above
may further time
amount available time number patients
performance
problem presented above was
open problem where however another notion regret than simple regret considered
problem was sense case two
only rewards given probability distributions over
related setting considered where
perform during random number
aim at best
study
goal probability
particular lower bounds
another related problem identification best high probability
however binary criterion either
does not possible performance compared optimal one
simple regret does
moreover latter criterion not analysis
