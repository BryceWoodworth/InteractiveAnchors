been suggested dynamics agent learning studied using population biology
most existing studies so far been limited strategy spaces small number available actions
many cases however choices available agents better characterized continuous
paper suggests generalization framework allows study adaptive dynamics learning agents continuous strategy spaces
instead probability vectors strategies now characterized probability measures over continuous variables

introduction
notion agents learn environment other agents central concept distributed
particular systems where multiple agents learn each other
learning problem attention due number important applications
among existing approaches learning algorithms become popular due their
although does not same convergence case been shown work well practice recent see
analysis complex system where learning individual agents each other via reward mechanism
thus know what possible behaviors those
specifically one usually whether particular game structure those state called fixed points between many states
while question very difficult most general settings there been some limited specific scenarios
particular been simple finite number actions learning dynamics examined using so called population biology
if one particular biological each strategy then adaptive learning strategies settings dynamics population where species according their relative population
framework been used study various features adaptive dynamics learning agents
few e g see most existing studies so far focused action spaces limited full analysis learning dynamics games very few actions
other hand many practical scenarios interactions between agents better characterized continuous possible choices
instance modeling continuous rather than variable more natural
situations strategies represented probability density functions defined over continuous set actions
all decisions made over subset
however using continuous approximation makes dynamics more mathematical analysis
paper consider simple learning agents play games
agents use mechanism through single parameter
reward functions agents assumed functions continuous variables instead agent strategies represented probability distribution over those variables
contrast finite strategy spaces where learning dynamics set dynamics games described each agent across different
behavior those define state agent strategies
shown general state strategy dynamics do not game
limited agents due
particular mechanism studied here results term payoff function rate
thus when one rate relative importance term one able
furthermore games allow state solution any rate
because distribution term
example game if provided section

section introduce our model derive continuous strategy spaces set functional describe state strategy

finally paper our results possible future section
