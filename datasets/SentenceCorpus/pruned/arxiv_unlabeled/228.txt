introduction
term convergence learning context stability learning process underlying model over time
similar single agent learning algorithms convergence learning algorithm important property attention
however convergence algorithm via theoretical analysis significantly more than convergence single agent case
presence other agents also learning environment therefore assumption single agent learning
fact convergence algorithm even games class systems domains been
experimental usually method choice number agents theoretical analysis complex
agents researchers typically stability algorithm evolution some global performance metric
not since goal system some global metric
examples global performance include total number problems average turn time tasks task problems average reward agents general
if global metric over time usually considered convergence
even if underlying agent not stable one could argue at end global performance all system
paper above practice need better experimental measures stability systems
show experimental case study where stability global performance metric underlying system
hidden later leads significant global performance metric itself
propose alternative measure local policy entropy
experimentally show proposed metric more effective than global performance metric algorithms systems
paper follows
section case study will using paper
section algorithms particular focus two algorithms use our experimental evaluation
section our initial experimental results where global performance metric leads algorithm
section our proposed measure how used hidden algorithm
