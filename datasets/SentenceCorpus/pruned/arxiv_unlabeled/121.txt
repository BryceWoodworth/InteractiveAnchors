introduction
problem sparse signal based small number measurements noise much recent attention
problem many different settings including model selection linear regression approximation problems
observations form where matrix given vector errors
goal unknown vector
depending settings error vector either case where
now well provides effective way sparse signal all three settings
special case particular interest when no noise present
system linear more variables than number
clear problem there generally many solutions
however many applications vector known sparse sparse sense contains only small number
assumption changes problem making unique solution possible
indeed many cases unique sparse solution found through p
problem been studied example
understanding case not only significant interest its own also provides into problem sparse signals case
see example
when noise present there two well known methods
one under
terms function related finding solution least
latter often called statistics literature
detailed treatment least problem
another method called recently proposed
sparse problem through correlation between vectors } showed linear program performance procedure up factor
clear conditions needed order problems well
over few years many results sparse signals been obtained framework property
their work considered sparse problems framework
they provided solutions problem under some conditions constant constant defined section
several different conditions been various settings
paper consider methods sparse problem three error noise
both under considered
give treatment two methods under three noise settings
our results improve existing results conditions error bounds
all cases solve problems under condition where constant constant defined section
condition shows signals larger support
although our main interest sparse signals state results general setting arbitrary signal
another widely used condition sparse so called property requires among vectors small
see
between
application present recent result
paper follows
section after basic two allow us make analysis sparse problem introduced
analysis methods sparse exact case section
our result main result using conditions error bounds
analysis case provides case when observations noise
then consider case error section
between also
case noise section
contains some results
