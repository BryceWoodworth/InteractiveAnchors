much recent work focused inference various types biological networks gene regulation metabolic processes interactions etc
common setting involves network set characterized multiple data sets protein sequence gene expression etc
here between two inference direct inference based upon between nodes inference based upon between one pair nodes another pair nodes
propose approach direct case into distance metric learning problem
resulting convex optimization problem leads support vector machine algorithm particular kernel pairs call metric learning kernel
demonstrate using several real biological networks direct approach often upon inference kernel
introduction
molecular systems biology various types networks
include interaction networks metabolic networks gene regulatory signaling pathways genetic interaction networks
while some networks experimental methods any network requires biochemical
therefore prediction other available data protein sequences global network gene expression importance either up important pathways methods subject high levels noise
network relevant data at least two ways
consider network interactions derived some
our confidence particular network increases if example two proteins same cellular similar evolutionary patterns
generally type direct inference two genes proteins predicted if they some direct similarity each other available data
alternative inference call inference upon between pairs genes proteins
example above our confidence increases if find some other pair some
note model two proteins might not similar one another
example if goal regulatory network using time series expression data one would time series protein time compared regulatory protein
therefore case learning phase would involve learning feature other pairs proteins
most common application inference approach case interaction involves comparing amino sequences versus e g
inference application machine learning problem each example task learn example between
not therefore several machine learning algorithms been applied predict network properties protein pairs
example context machine learning support vector kernel methods describe how individual proteins pairs proteins
two pairs proteins similar each other when each protein pair similar one corresponding protein other pair
practice defined kernel function pairs proteins kernel function individual proteins obtained initial feature space
therefore call kernel shown below kernel } less attention been use machine learning approaches direct inference
two et al et al who derive machine learning algorithms measure similarity direct approach learning examples pairs
et al kernel correlation analysis proteins into feature space where expected presence interactions between protein pairs
et al similarity approach problem distance metric learning while algorithm
both direct inference approaches however two important
first they based optimization function different objective finding distance metric pairs some threshold
second methods only when known part network used training defined subset proteins network
other words order apply methods must complete set one set proteins network
setting
practice our training data will generally known positive negative distributed target network
paper propose convex learning direct inference both above
show approach sense kernel between pairs proteins kernel between individual proteins
therefore call our method metric learning kernel
important property learn several data types particular importance various applications
approach task two yeast network metabolic pathways network
each case network variety genomic data including protein amino sequences gene expression levels over large set experiments protein cellular
show approach always provides better prediction performance than approach
