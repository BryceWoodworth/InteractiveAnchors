sample over two
while maximum classes concept classes general concept classes classes classes cannot without increasing
two ways classes into maximum classes at most increase dimension via
paper positive results latter approach first negative result through finite maximum classes
simple space shown represent maximum classes corresponding result
show across size dimension special case graph recent
between finite maximum classes certain either space
finally show maximum classes corresponding
main result any finite maximum class
some classes cannot into any maximum class dimension any constant
involves graph corresponding across other
well known
introduction
concept classes possible their given dimension
classes particular interest their special structure all general sample known
structure many upon paper
introduced study defined pair given concept class sample examples concept consistent sample
maximum shown
classes dimension size become one problems within learning theory
interest been its existence bounds classes basis practical machine learning methods understanding properties concept classes
recently maximum classes without use
they also their algorithm maximum classes
discussed our previous work maximum classes
also each natural open sets its standard into space
maximum classes constant result maximum classes graphs
special form maximum classes
however there many cannot more detailed structure maximum classes than given
paper approach direction simple maximum classes
predicted maximum classes corresponding simple linear could across their corresponding cell
first part show new form prove distinct
while minimum degree graph unique maximum dimension
explore simple show set maximum classes those represented simple linear
classes
existence maximum due whether classes positive explicitly
present but classes there many maximum classes under appropriate conditions
next prove all maximum classes represented simple
previous work simple maximum classes
close relationship between their suggests they could
main problem open version paper show does all finite maximum classes
show graph represented if only if strongly complex
class
note then graphs same size dimension
moreover if graph then complex
give simple example show there graphs but not strongly so not represented
cannot without increase their sufficient all classes classes their
classes into maximum classes
present results following our minimum degree our new results
explore examples classes but not classes not strongly but
finally investigate properties maximum classes
most maximum classes corresponding simple linear
result study maximum classes related
several open problems
