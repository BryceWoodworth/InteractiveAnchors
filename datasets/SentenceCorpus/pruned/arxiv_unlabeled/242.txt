many learning structure hidden variables now being used information
however several learning used not but statistical models hence their generalization performance still unknown
problems previous new statistical learning estimate generalization loss training loss functional condition true distribution learning machine
paper prove same even if true distribution not model
also prove proposed case information criterion
therefore proposed always without any condition unknown true distribution
introduction
learning being used information
however several learning used example neural networks hidden markov models normal reduced rank structure hidden variables result parameter probability distribution not
learning was out maximum likelihood not subject normal distribution distribution not any distribution
hence statistical methods model selection hypothesis test optimization not learning
other words not yet theoretical learning hidden structures random samples
statistical learning theory study problem learning generalization based several assumptions
let true probability density function learning machine represented probability density function parameter
paper examine following two assumptions 1 first condition
true distribution learning machine if there parameter
if called 2 second condition
true distribution learning machine if parameter loss function } unique if matrix positive
if true distribution not learning machine then
study neural networks normal both conditions important
fact if learning machine compared true distribution then true distribution
if learning machine too simple approximate true distribution then true distribution
practical applications need method determine optimal learning machine therefore general formula generalization loss estimated training loss without conditions
previous studied case when true distribution new us estimate generalization loss training loss functional
since new arbitrary set true distribution learning machine distribution they called states statistical estimation
however not been whether they not case
paper study case when true distribution prove same states also
moreover show case states information criterion maximum likelihood method
here was derived model selection criterion case when true distribution not statistical model
network information criterion was arbitrary loss function case
if true distribution learning machine whereas states average generalization losses
therefore states version maximum likelihood method case method cases
