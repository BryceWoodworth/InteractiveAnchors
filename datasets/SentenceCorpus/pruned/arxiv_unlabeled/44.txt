introduction
task predicting preferences given based their previously known preferences well preferences other
system example one would like suggest new based what others recently
problem matrix objects e g corresponding preferences one would like
case preference could binary variable even more quantitative scale 1
standard known about objects preferences expressed so far
setting most common assumption preferences into small number factors both objects resulting search matrix observed matrix preferences
problem usually difficult problem only heuristic algorithms exist
convex been obtained rank norm matrix
many practical applications however description objects through attributes e g measures similarity available
case take advantage both known preferences model preferences
important framework over potentially allows prediction preferences new new objects
seen learning preference function examples problem any algorithm classification regression taking input pair object
if example positive kernel between pairs description object then learning algorithms like support vector kernel regression applied
algorithms empirical risk over kernel space defined kernel
both rank norm regularization based prior hypothesis about nature preferences
rank based hypothesis preferences limited number factors describe objects
norm preferences between similar similar objects where similarity terms kernel pairs
main work propose framework both one hand between approach approaches other hand
particular framework matrix learning classical over spaces
show experiment resulting algorithm lead significant over other methods
