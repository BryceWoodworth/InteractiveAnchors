recently different proposed new way patterns size
example experiments genome biology usually provide attributes genes but only objects experiments
case database through smaller search space allows patterns original database
focus here pattern those give theoretical framework database
discuss properties into classical constraints
then address problem patterns original database those database
finally show how generate all patterns ones
introduction
pattern now well but patterns like rules too very
they
however order
under complex become subject e g
moreover new domains our applications data
genome biology biological experiments very time
therefore only small number experiments
however new experiments provide measurements activity genes
leads genes few experiments
present efficient algorithms patterns defined large
minimum maximum frequency threshold together other constraints
algorithms designed up several
however their complexity number thus they not too many like those genome biology
recently two were solve instead original database algorithms work database i e original database become database indeed same database but different representation
therefore database significantly less than original one
algorithm specifically designed patterns our uses classical algorithm patterns
both approaches use principle however problem under constraints not studied complex constraints i e simple constraints
paper study problem theoretical point view
our aim use classical algorithms pattern algorithms patterns algorithms database use their output patterns original database instead directly original database
there several questions will therefore what information database patterns original database
possible constraints i e given database possible find database information about patterns original original database
how patterns original database patterns database
how generate all using patterns
questions will
paper some related pattern
then show how complex constraints
section complete about patterns using database show how use all i e not only patterns
finally short
