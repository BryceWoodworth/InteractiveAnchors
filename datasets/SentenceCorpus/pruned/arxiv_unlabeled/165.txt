introduction
when behavior environment under any control signal known then choose agent dynamics
problem include target under known conditions having its
however when behavior unknown then problem adaptive control
example appropriate finding way out unknown
adaptive control out far more difficult than its
because any good policy versus actions i e actions identification dynamics versus actions control way
even when dynamics known particular class optimal agents available corresponding optimal adaptive agent general even simple problems
thus finding been major focus research
recently been proposed problem some classes control problems based relative entropy criterion
example large class optimal control problems very if problem dynamics system system
work similar approach introduced
if class agents given where each agent different environment then adaptive derived minimum relative entropy principle
particular one construct adaptive agent universal respect class average relative entropy agent
however not
there difference between actions observations taken into account when problem
more specifically actions rules
if made problem unique solution given stochastic control rule called bayesian control rule
control rule particularly because adaptive control problem into inference problem applied time
furthermore work shows under assumptions adaptive agent agent
paper follows

after initial approach need
then bayesian control rule derived relative entropy criterion
