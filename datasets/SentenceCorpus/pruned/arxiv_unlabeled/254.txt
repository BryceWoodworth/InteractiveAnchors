introduction
useful version learning when both observed data variables
examples range hidden alignment variables recognition machine estimation computer
techniques all based probabilistic models
their variable thus use
paper show algorithm see section prediction section
1 under appropriate maximization 2 used obtain performance task setting section
key work consider prediction observed input itself prediction problem
