introduction
common procedure sampling elements population before sample way obtain most useful information data
procedure called
may different information some all regions provide more population more elements into them according one more variables
latter case also called statistical
use statistical order obtain better what sample must taken each chosen functional relation between size each number sample
thus important consider itself order do statistical
paper propose exact algorithm solve statistical problem call simply problem simple
specifically method solve problem optimal simple random sampling without using
problem must population size into variable also called size variable whose values known all population
first defined set population whose values lower than constant value second one set whose values greater than lower than so
based defined set population values where each set observations values greater than
problem optimal find total one more variables study some correlation variable even variable
solve problem new algorithm when used proposed using idea graphs
paper
section 2 present some basic about simple random sampling
section define problem work about different approaches
propose section algorithm based graph theory order provide exact solutions problem defined section
finally present some computational results about new algorithm
