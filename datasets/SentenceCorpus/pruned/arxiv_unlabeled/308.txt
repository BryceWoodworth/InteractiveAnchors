here adaptive agents mixture distributions over sequences
each distribution mixture but agent does not know possible actually
problem way true world
natural measure adaptation obtained between distribution true world distribution expected agent about possible
case input bayesian mixture provides solution problem
show however case solution because agent itself require different probabilistic provided
based obtain bayesian control rule allows modeling adaptive behavior mixture distributions over
rule might allow novel approach adaptive control based minimum
introduction
ability unknown environments often considered
agent environment two systems every time step agent action whereas environment observation
thus both agent environment probability distributions over sequences actions observations
if environment known then probability distribution agent particular environment
however if environment unknown but known set possible environments then agent adaptation problem
consider example been set behavioral now problem how while being correct
since model both agent environment probability distributions over sequences natural way measure degree adaptation would measure probability space between distribution represented agent distribution true environment
measure terms its provided
case prediction adaptation problem solution
distribution bayesian mixture distribution over all possible environments
aim paper result distributions over both
main result paper only possible if consider special actions probability theory been suggested
