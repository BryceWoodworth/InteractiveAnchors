introduction
consider training data set where data points
problem learning linear classifier where linear function when
over years support vector tools functions
paper algorithms learning large datasets
detailed review classification regression see
develop discuss problem training linear
datasets given } where norm
very
distance between convex sets
datasets following } will called due used
do not like case but one consider distance between two reduced convex
both optimization
defined every dimension associated dimension notion number free variables
algorithm size greater than dimension problem
property design algorithms
idea develop algorithm where each step one solve small subset training data
idea size subset dimension
end note at given } both case
using variables one define set support }
set may not unique though
dimension given minimum number required define
more } where set
parameter does not change number examples often much less than
value not known but classification problems following
follows observation distance between 2 convex
when problem not reduced convex leads very bound much larger than
idea over size greater than training was first resulting algorithm was called
procedure over size shown algorithm
however authors not practical because following
linear sample size too large case high data sets
dimension feature space usually unknown when using
even case one obtain very reduced convex approach but not useful number obtained very large work above problems using random algorithms
authors their algorithm value too large
main work using random if using then solution obtained close optimal high particularly almost data sets
almost data sets those become when small number chosen data points them
second algorithm using algorithms linear problem using samples size linear
work also shows theory applied
regression problems
