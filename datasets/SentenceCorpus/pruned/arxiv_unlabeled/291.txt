graphs
introduction
networks become essential part number

examples include widely power
interaction networks

work
focus particular networks made

impact
new social network like
increasing
influence
example showed
important role
us

although only small actually used

their influence extended far their result
their interactions

article propose

structure during us

data set over

independent where
nodes if there
exists one another
many strategies been developed study networks structure

made between
methods
between models
among
methods clustering provided
efficient way complex networks structures
basic
idea strategies model distribution
network
nodes among unknown number
connectivity classes
themselves unknown
clustering network
data various modeling
strategies been considered
propose
mixture model
some propose mixture
consider continuous
hidden variables et al consider both
stochastic structure
article our not compare
different models but focus computational
issue most them
indeed even if modeling
strategies like algorithms common core
estimation strategy
algorithm known convergence very
size data set
issue should into perspective
new analysis network data
sets
development optimization strategies
networks
nodes if
not more
extent bayesian strategies limited they may
not networks more than few few
algorithms may not
statistical point view
strategies
been proposed well
but they same
thus new
question work perform efficient
clustering
computational point view very large networks
networks over time

online algorithms efficient alternative classical
algorithms
when data set over time
application strategies
mixture models
been studied many authors
clustering algorithms
include online means algorithm
more
recently
using algorithm
estimation mixture
models
however additional difficulty mixture models random
graphs
distribution hidden variables

observation cannot due

work consider two alternative
strategies
issue
first one based simulation

leading stochastic version algorithm stochastic
approximation

second one method proposed

approximation
strategy
also been proposed
bayesian framework
article database
us
then present model proposed
compare model its
terms modeling strategies
use data set
derive online
framework estimate parameters mixture using
methods
simulations used show online
methods very effective terms time
parameter estimation clustering
simulations
both increasing size networks
online methods been designed
finally
connectivity structure us using
proposed online algorithm model
