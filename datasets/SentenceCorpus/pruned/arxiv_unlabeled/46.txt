approximation optimal given data through following i each step may take may not know when whether will at sequence models generated may not improve but model associated almost best
individual models individual data sets rely complexity
introduction
machine learning applications because one define model because
analyze aspects both power
let us first problem our some involved
process involves reduction entropy features learning problems main work
when out they random
thus entropy increasing order
found
both solve two same but they different strategies
all according according assume no strategy efficient whereas strategy not fact even than random strategy
strategy efficient since probability about same much greater than probability
other hand information about only used relatively process
effort time because must before solve
example shows if solution problem depends finding reduction entropy does not mean every reduction entropy us solution
reduction entropy not all cases good strategy
