clustering algorithms data points clustering who make decisions games
network relationships among data points function explore data point small payoffs new larger payoffs
among data points over time
during evolution network some strategies network
clusters data points same stable strategy so number stable strategies number clusters
moreover experimental results demonstrated data points datasets comparison other algorithms also provides proposed algorithms learning data clustering evolutionary game theory stable strategy
introduction
analysis important pattern recognition widely used many pattern analysis data information image
past years many clustering algorithms been presented means support vector clustering clustering etc data points clustering fixed various functions designed find
recent years however significant change been made
some researchers thought about why not those data points could themselves just like agents together
therefore following their they few algorithms data points space according certain simple local rules
game theory into being games
game was widely studied
two present theory game proposed concept existence finite game
although game was required game must rational even
if assumption could not might not
other hand evolutionary game theory biology analyze between
classical game theory dynamics strategy change more than properties strategy does not require rational
important concept stable strategy evolutionary game theory was defined introduced
was often used explain evolution social behavior
best our knowledge problem data clustering not been investigated based evolutionary game theory
so if data points considered games could clusters games among them
question answer
our clustering algorithm each his own payoff so his strategies payoffs
strategies some strategies network
finally some will each same strategy used
according different strategies data points several different clusters
paper section 2 some basic methods about evolutionary game theory evolutionary game graph
section model based upon games network proposed described specifically
section three algorithms based model algorithms
section those datasets used experiments then experimental results algorithms
further relationship between number clusters number discussed three functions clustering algorithms compared
given section
