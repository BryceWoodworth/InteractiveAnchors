made possible single event large number points using multiple
many scenarios very data signals
data typically rely models
models provide particularly model structure data when set parameters
however models do not typically take into account among multiple
thus propose new framework data
show simple algorithms structure improve their performance standard signal processing applications
recent results reduction us data uses random data
data all through addition data
introduction
notion common yet modeling data
models cases where i parameter identified relevant information about signal signal changes continuous typically function parameters
some examples include signal unknown time delay variable signal underlying image object at unknown unknown object its
many other cases signal class } where parameter space
also been proposed approximate models signal classes human
many scenarios multiple observations same event may performed resulting multiple same parameter space
example networks networks typically single event variety points while underlying phenomenon often described set common global parameters objects interest
when single phenomenon using multiple underlying phenomenon may described single all
cases will show model structure simply each
thus introduce concept model data vectors observed group
development learning estimation algorithms structure
furthermore they applied data any
work theoretical properties
particular compare their component see how like condition number affected
then properties lead performance variety signal processing algorithms when they structure processing data each
also how structure through simple efficient data algorithm uses random also applied data
related prior work studied alignment where goal between several datasets same underlying structure
et al \ proposed algorithm obtain matching between data points several classes
algorithm first reduction using obtain data intrinsic class
then function set points applied datasets
concept was extended who apply analysis datasets obtain alignment function between pair
since alignment function provided instead data point matching obtained rather than set points
our setting assume either i alignment provided via between different been using one approaches described above
our main focus theoretical analysis provided versus our task interest each observed individual
paper follows
