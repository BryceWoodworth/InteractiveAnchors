prediction uses past experience determine levels confidence new predictions
given error probability together method makes prediction set typically also contains probability
prediction applied any method method machine regression etc
prediction designed setting predicted each one being revealed before next predicted
most novel feature prediction if examples same distribution then predictions will time even though they based rather than independent datasets
addition model under examples other models also use prediction
widely used linear model one
account theory prediction through several numerical examples
more treatment provided learning random world
introduction
how good prediction
if you predicting new object how you
if number how close do you
machine learning questions usually way past experience
new predictions about well past predictions
prediction uses past experience determine levels confidence predictions
given method making prediction prediction prediction region set contains probability at least
typically also contains prediction
call point prediction call region prediction
case regression where number typically
case classification where limited number possible values may few values case just one
prediction used any method point prediction classification regression including decision neural networks bayesian prediction
method point prediction construct measure measures how example relative previous examples algorithm measure into prediction regions
given measure algorithm prediction region every probability error
region prediction region contains probability at least
regions different when so lower level confidence than
if contains only single outcome case classification may how small made before must second corresponding value confidence predicted
explain algorithm designed setting predict objects each after predicted before predict next one
our prediction may use observed features object examples
size prediction region may also depend
most algorithm may turn directly examples then turn more general needed
explain leads new concept validity prediction confidence
method finding prediction regions was considered if had probability predicted because large numbers would then correct time when applied independent datasets
but apply method not independent datasets but
after using predict use predict so
method predictions must correct
under assumptions prediction new sense
one setting where prediction new sense one examples constant e fixed but unknown probability distribution
also under assumption examples see under other models including widely used linear model see
validity prediction under models demonstrated
addition validity method prediction regions also its
efficient if prediction region usually relatively small therefore
classification would like see prediction region so small contains only single predicted
regression would like see very predicted number
confidence prediction region under no what probability distribution examples no what measure used construct prediction region
but prediction will depend measure
if know may choose measure will efficient if
if prior probabilities may use prior probabilities construct point predictor measure
regression case might use mean distribution given first examples classification case might use probability
strategy first validity under relatively assumption then under assumptions long given others
prediction studied learning random world
