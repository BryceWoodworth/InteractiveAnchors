large number variables most data sets often prediction dependent variable
number variables reduced using either techniques selection latter allow selected variables
since optimal approach testing all possible variables prediction model selection approach using statistics good option use model itself
two number groups variables test still make results
paper method groups variables
procedure applied representation
criterion used procedure information find between variables generally used correlation
representation used results groups variables will selected
experiments show method provides identified groups selected variables making while low computational
prediction obtained using selected higher than those obtained same method applied directly original variables similar those obtained using models although using significantly less variables
introduction
prediction problems often
they require unknown value dependent variable example
problems may only few
statistical data analysis perspective main difficulty problem between not only variables highly correlated nature but addition real applications usually low number known high number variables
any method original variables thus making feature variable selection necessary
selection methods differ several aspects
methods more general selection may many weights
however methods usually factors variables large number original features
even if their prediction properties good they usually fact variables terms original features case
selection methods based principle choosing small number variables among original ones leading
selection methods obtain prediction same level ones
work variable selection methods
however if whole procedure features prediction model them linear will lead than widely used least latter prediction
thus investigated how models may used both features prediction
models could used approach their estimated generalization used criterion group variables
however very terms computational because techniques must used estimate predicted error model addition fact one model must learned each considered feature set
paper thus features selected prior use any prediction model
among methods correlation standard criterion used features linear features correlation dependent output variable information between them selected
information see eg correlation measure while correlation limited linear ones
example correlation between variable its second power despite fact they depend one another though way
information more general less way measure between variables
information been used variables
despite provides way analysis direct selection variables some
first estimation difficult number selected variables
indeed procedure estimation making estimation selected feature much more difficult than first selected one
second low number usually available learning makes results selection highly dependent data small change data lead different selected variable sets resulting difficult
finally even though estimation information less terms time than model large number initial variables results high times selection
paper propose first reduce number variables through features before selection information
despite use latter each set initial features
general proposed functional basis
more eg basis chosen rather than indeed advantage they same length over whole range
each depends value corresponding limited
complete procedure then their relevant their information output variable predicting latter using function networks any other model could used
all three procedure necessary high both prediction
design parameters context number used set without choice using method
paper shows prediction results obtained procedure than those obtained through linear techniques
addition number selected procedure remains low making possible identify phenomenon predict
moreover allows us both reduce feature selection time increase quality prediction results compared same procedure applied directly original variables
section paper how basis how number set computational complexity procedure
section information criterion its use procedure
also computational complexity method
section shows examples application proposed method two data sets
first one obtained aim predict
second one database samples goal predict number
