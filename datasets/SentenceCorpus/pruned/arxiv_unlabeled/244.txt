approach classifier proposed
classifier called if fixed number parameters so represented point into space
genetic algorithm used instead search learn parameters classifier
proposed approach also cases when effective algorithm learning some classifier parameters exists into account
experiments approach classifier training time while both training test errors small
introduction
one used classifier learning approaches
machine learning model some classifier family
case classification problem will consider paper classifier usually form } there sample learned during procedure classifier weights
set classifier family
because elements should error rate only better than random
key idea strong classifier many
there many differ type loss being classifier
but no what procedure used each should learn classifier loss family using special algorithm called
fast accurate optimization methods often not there especially case classifier parameters so search over classifier parameter space used
search take time
example learning based features search over classifier parameter space several work
why often very important classifier learning time using some appropriate numerical optimization approach
one widely used approaches numerical optimization genetic algorithm
based biological evolution
optimization problem solution vector solutions using random number then used value every population
solutions values selected next step
next step mutation usually applied selected produce new solutions existing ones
solutions form up new
then described process
how evolution
global solution found time evolution over
genetic algorithms often used global search search spaces
makes genetic algorithm good classifier
