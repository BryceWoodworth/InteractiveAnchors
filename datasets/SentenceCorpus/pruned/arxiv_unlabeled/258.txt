develop bayesian framework clustering problem problem tasks reference matching uncertainty
our clustering model based process prior us define distributions over sets problem
our model existence set random variables call across all clusters
inference our framework requires over many parameters using markov techniques
present algorithms both
present our model based assumption
evaluate model one task three tasks comparing against both algorithms
our results show our model able other models across variety tasks performance
introduction
clustering general problem occurs different
like standard clustering problem involves finite set into way unknown
between clustering standard clustering form given training examples
training examples learning algorithm determine what aspects relevant appropriate clustering
training examples their correct
end clustering task prediction new presented system must produce
clustering problem under many depending
learning typically uncertainty primary task system so does not even explicitly assume there between elements knowledge base real world
database task context known
information particularly context task identify same
here task known reference matching
natural processing problem context one identify same person real life
machine learning been learning under constraints learning examples
paper propose model clustering problem
our model advantage process prior bayesian prior over distributions
prior two first allows us estimate number clusters second allows us control complexity solutions learned
present inference methods our model based markov methods
compare our model against other methods large data sets where show able most other systems according several performance
paper follows
section describe prior clustering problem
section develop our framework problem very basic assumptions about task
general inference framework section
next section present three our framework describe appropriate adaptation inference
then discuss performance clustering problem section present experimental results our performance problems section
section our model our our learning techniques
