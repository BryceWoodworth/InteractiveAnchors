correlation analysis technique common features pair data
complex situations however does not useful features because its
other hand kernel method used support vector machine efficient approach improve linear method
paper investigate kernel method correlation analysis analysis data kernel method regularization
introduction
paper method common features multiple information sources
instance let us consider task learning pattern recognition object given using image its given
given image system required answer its given system answer corresponding image
task considered regression problem image
however since generally very large regression analysis many not work
order solve problem useful into low feature space then solve regression problem
correlation analysis been used
linear pair correlation
information theoretical point view information between features
however if there relation between does not always useful features
other hand support vector attention its performance pattern recognition kernel used not only classification but also other linear techniques example kernel regression kernel paper apply kernel method
since kernel method likely data some regularization technique
