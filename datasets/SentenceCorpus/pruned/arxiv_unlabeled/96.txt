classification problem described density models similarity been shown optimal similarity measure classification
paper several additional properties distribution
paper first shows up class class distribution given procedure class classification procedure
also shows given optimal similarity measure how construct classifier classifier classification rates
paper then bayesian similarity framework where classifier number related classification tasks learning class distribution not possible general
finally paper distinct class classification problems using shows using solve those problems optimal solution
introduction
statistical models similarity become important recent work information pattern recognition computer
particular interest bayesian similarity model will
models been demonstrated work well number pattern recognition visual object recognition problems
see classification using risk class differ therefore optimal classification
however observation there been several analysis bayesian similarity
first presented analysis single instance classification problem determined distribution class feature vectors
authors also argue existence useful properties bayesian similarity functions when those functions specific form
second analysis based bayesian framework presented bayesian similarity context distribution related classification tasks
paper relationship between bayesian similarity class distribution both cases uses those results construct classification procedure using bayesian similarity
also new statistical model tasks described bayesian similarity solution those tasks
results applications bayesian similarity will discussed at end
