propose method approximate inference methods influence model
method arbitrary factor graphs provided size markov not too large
alternative idea introduced recently
its form assumption no present method variation method approximation uses factors clusters
other hand using estimates effect obtained some approximate inference algorithm method usually significantly better results than approximate inference algorithm directly without
indeed often error error approximate inference method used estimate effect
compare different method other approximate inference methods variety models including networks approach generally most accurate results
introduction
recent years much research been field approximate inference models
one obtain accurate probabilities complex probability distributions defined over many variables using limited time memory
research large number approximate inference methods
sampling methods most methods algorithms mean field statistical belief also known algorithm belief directly related approximation used statistical variation method other approximation methods related approximation generalization approximation using larger special case
results other region based approximation methods one use belief algorithm algorithms convergence
belief exact results if model tree more generally if each component tree
if model does contain still accurate results using little time
however if influence large approximate large errors quality results may not
one way correct influence short increase size approximation using clusters many possible
however good set clusters highly general method will only work if clusters do not many other words if do not many
another method certain extent does exact inference base tree model no other interactions
part base tree one additional factor good results if model base tree case very sparse models
however two more interactions not part base tree similar way
hence models over usually
article propose method into account all model approximate way therefore more accurate results many cases
our method variation introduced
basic idea first estimate distributions all variables improve estimates out errors using certain consistency constraints
distribution some variable probability distribution its markov all its variables model all factors involving variable been
factors all variable part
allows approximate inference algorithm estimate terms effective interactions between variables markov
then influence factors taken into account accurate probability distributions original model
even more accuracy obtained certain consistency between distributions results errors some extent
error algorithm generalization case approximation general
indeed assumption no present distributions results
other hand using better estimates effective interactions distributions accurate results
although basic idea underlying our method very similar described alternative propose here two
most directly arbitrary factor graphs whereas original method only been rather special case models binary variables factors eg \ many bayesian networks
furthermore our more robust also results relatively strong interactions will shown
article follows
first explain theory our proposed method discuss differences original method
then report numerical experiments quality approximation time where compare other approximate inference methods
finally discuss results state
