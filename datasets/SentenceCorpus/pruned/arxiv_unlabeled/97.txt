introduction
recently many learning being used information processing systems
example neural networks normal networks reduced rank hidden markov models stochastic being pattern recognition time series prediction control human modeling
although their generalization determine accuracy information systems been difficult estimate generalization errors based training errors because learning statistical models
model called if parameter probability distribution if its information matrix always positive
if statistical model then distribution normal distribution maximum likelihood
based properties relation between generalization error training error was some information were proposed
other hand if parameter probability distribution not if information matrix then model called
general if learning machine structure hidden variables then
therefore almost all learning
learning likelihood function not any form parameter result relationship between generalization errors training errors does not either maximum likelihood method estimation
strongly affect generalization learning dynamics
therefore order mathematical learning theory necessary construct even learning
recently generalization error estimation where rational number determined function learning machine number training samples
statistical models where dimension parameter space whereas statistical models depends strongly learning machine true distribution probability distribution
practical applications true distribution often unknown hence been difficult estimate generalization error training error
estimate generalization error when do not any information about true distribution need general formula
paper study four errors 1 generalization error 2 training error generalization error training error prove where value distribution
increased error training generalization difference between training errors
should any true distribution any learning machine any probability distribution any therefore they universal statistical estimation
also based formula propose widely information applied both learning
other words apply without any knowledge about true distribution
paper
section 2 describe main results paper
section propose widely information show how apply them statistical estimation
section prove main results way
discuss paper
hence they presented
