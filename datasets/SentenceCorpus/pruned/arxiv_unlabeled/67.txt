introduction
past few years there been interest support vector because they generalization performance wide range problems
key work training solve optimization problem
where vector all ones bound all variables kernel function
effects been taken into training
most optimization methods whole vector each method only subset per
each variable into its
then variables values variables
method leads small each
case sequential set only two elements
comparative tests against other algorithms often much better properties
since only few components per difficult problems method convergence
better method set selection reduce number hence important research issue
some methods were proposed solve problem reduce time training
paper proposed propose new model set
model without
another selected they will not tested selected during following set selection
experiments demonstrate new model general than existing methods
paper following
section give literature review method existing set selection both discussed
new method set selection then presented section
section experiments corresponding analysis given
finally section paper
