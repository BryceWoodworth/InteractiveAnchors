introduction
methods generally into learning
learning requires feedback provided pairs
learning only processes input data
contrast uses value reward evaluate pairs states actions interaction environment through
since become important approach machine learning widely used especially due its good performance adaptation learning ability complex systems
however there still some difficult problems practical applications
one problem strategy better previously strategies find better policy taking most advantage knowledge
other its learning especially complex problems known when space number parameters learned its dimension
those problems many methods been proposed recent years
temporal methods been solve problems dynamic up learning
different learning combined
example presented new model representation generalization based standard
adaptation inference systems problems large spaces continuous state spaces also proposed
many specific also related methods practice
all more work needed achieve new necessary explore more effective representation methods learning mechanisms
paper explore some using theory propose novel learning method
information processing field
some results shown more solve some difficult problems than classical
two important algorithms algorithm algorithm been proposed
algorithm give large into numbers been using
algorithm achieve over classical algorithms database its experimental also been demonstrated using system four states
some methods also been machine learning
example version neural network been studied theory simple experimental
used control algorithm up inference
evolutionary algorithms been proposed improve existing evolutionary algorithms
presented algorithm optimization
recently search technique been used dynamic
taking advantage some novel algorithms characteristics will not only improve performance existing algorithms but also development related research machine learning
algorithms his presented concept learning state principle
following concept paper give learning algorithm framework specifically demonstrate up learning good between through experiments some related
paper follows
section contains problem description standard learning related
section learning introduced where state action space represented state strategy based novel algorithm proposed specifically
section related characteristics convergence between
section experiments results demonstrate algorithm
section discuss some related problems future work
given section
