introduction
model approaches statistical learning inference many machine learning statistical
applications often require evaluation over large number problem cases
paper focus one difficult problem occurs when random environment
long their two rather
when density time increase many possible sets become data multiple two likely
despite one estimates properties environment should still possible if number large
problem address here
nature their environment not subject particular eg they might organisms
here consider case problem context experiments
given statistical model unknown parameters along two one at predicting most values model parameters
task section maximum over all possible between two
problem out matrix known complete problem
main paper efficient accurate algorithm belief type class weight matrices problem
algorithm minimum free energy model
model nodes associated measured according model constraints condition one per active
known exact result maximum likelihood version problem finding maximum weight matching multiple model
algorithm matching problem derived discussed section
could factor functions model
furthermore solutions also provide representation exact function terms series
our main result expression efficient approximation series problem matching
section where series expressed terms order functional reduced finally estimated approximation
section empirical results performance comparison approximation
our accuracy significant gains terms
number experiments typically large order argue our approach both useful applications
