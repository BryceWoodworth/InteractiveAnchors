introduction
recent years data been designed many domains processing processing computer
they provide way including known information using directly natural structure objects
using knowledge through because allows reduce number training examples existing data well developed those domains
paper propose kernel between point applications classification
natural structure point represent few features particular because required local global b lack point i e points one not points another c noise only two point compared
following one leading between data propose at all possible between two point
more assume each point graph structure most often graph consider recently introduced graph
consider all possible compare matching
however set even set size cannot described so larger sets used eg
shown appropriate local efficient dynamic allow over number time
kernel thus provides efficient way very large feature spaces see eg
however context computer sets points local use local kernel cannot expressed terms each pair points dynamic approaches cannot then applied
main paper design local kernel not but instead according graph underlying
through models design positive matrices models
novel local kernel derive new time dynamic
present simulations recognition
