introduction
learning two learning been
recent studies investigated use learning methods learning either value policy
initial results shown represented using either binary therefore possible classification algorithms within several learning
allows performance learning algorithms terms performance classification
while variety become possible through there been limited practical algorithms
our work work who suggested approximate policy algorithm learning good policy represented classifier any value function
at each new produced using training data obtained through simulation previous policy model process
aim at better action choices over subset states order form set data training classifier policy
similar algorithm was proposed et al at same time
key differences between two algorithms related types learning problems they choice underlying classifier type exact form classifier training
main training data using over same
even though both studies into distribution training states over state space their major remains large amount sampling at each training state
however could sampling
our paper suggests sampling procedure within above algorithm goal training sets therefore similar quality but significantly less effort terms number effort
setting problem over states states using
algorithms problems confidence allow optimal trials states
our techniques b suggest statistical test early high confidence states actions
obtain up order over original algorithm terms effort needed training data each classifier
makes resulting algorithm who need address large problems
paper follows
section provides necessary section original algorithm based
our approach presented section
finally section experimental results obtained learning domains
