more specifically prove if there exists any there exists online prediction algorithm bound times size size graph
previous known bound problem obtain prediction algorithm graphs high effective
contrast previous approaches graph problem into problems vector space using graph rely analysis algorithm our
further more our approach directly case where not binary
introduction
online prediction problem graphs
given graph unknown prediction algorithm each prediction algorithm provides answer then correct
goal number algorithm makes i e
make our work do not made first question
problem been studied standard online learning tools algorithm
use graph kernel provide bound depends size based real effective between any pair graph
recently structure graph provides bounds
present algorithm problem predicts given based known its
they also prove bound number when known
however their bound very since does not every their still based graph
compare bound obtain previous bounds et
al section
work follows
show between prediction problem following online problem first introduced their study online
given graph algorithm sequence where each where one some previous know where
algorithm online i e before other where
given set define defined number use
performance algorithm measured maximum any
prove section if there exists algorithm any will no greater than there exists online prediction algorithm bound where set pairs different i e
section apply known bound show bound graph prediction problem compare bound obtained bounds previous results
note our approach directly case when not binary i e when function arbitrary set same bound
