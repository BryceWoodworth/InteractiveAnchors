information criterion feature selection strategy good between selected feature subset time
however requires set information determine when procedure
two choices difficult make because subset increases estimation information less less
paper use methods test address both
methods information about information then used set parameter threshold procedure
procedure well examples
introduction
feature selection among set input features variables subset features maximum prediction power output
more let us consider random input vector continuous random output variable predicted
task feature selection finding features most relevant predict value
features important practice especially when methods like basis function networks support vector depending kernel considered
methods indeed their tend when variables data
when data i e initial number variables large search optimal feature set
cases furthermore most methods features perform
procedure instance methods feature selection methods like learning vector algorithm require model all initial features
data will often lead large times convergence problems more generally related
approaches furthermore bound specific prediction model
contrast feature selection procedure applied using any model small feature
procedure furthermore simple often efficient
when data difficult perform search using prediction model directly
because every feature subset prediction model must involving techniques optimal structural parameters
alternative estimate each subset statistical measure without using prediction model itself
combined use feature search criterion generally considered good option when effects using correlation
context information estimated using approach been shown effective
approach just like most feature selection two
first one all feature selection methods optimal choice number features
most time number features chosen so criterion
approach no optimization while latter may very estimation criterion
second difficulty choice estimation criterion
indeed most correlation at least one structural parameter like number kernel prediction model number number etc
often result selection highly depends value those
aim paper provide procedure choose two important parameters i e number features search structural criterion estimation
procedure will detailed situation where information used criterion estimated through
methods will used obtain choice
those methods increase computational cost search but provide information about quality setting will shown test used procedure combination allows optimal number estimation information
paper follows
section information test how they used together
section number information estimation number features search
section then proposed approach
method data reported section
