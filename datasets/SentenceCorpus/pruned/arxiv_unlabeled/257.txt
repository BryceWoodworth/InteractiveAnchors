present algorithm solve complex prediction problems those occur natural computational biology complex problems into simple classification problems any binary classifier may applied
current algorithms learning require both loss function feature functions over predicted structure able learn prediction functions any loss function any class features
moreover strong natural theoretical good performance derived classification problems good performance prediction problem
introduction
prediction task learning function input domain output domain
standard vector decision neural networks etc
focus output domains case binary classification case regression
problems elements complex structure
best studied output domain sequences
however even more complex domains space instance machine application space short application space possible elements database information application
complexity features loss functions problems significantly sequence problems
high level there four along prediction algorithms structure structure efficient learning possible loss different loss functions learning possible features feature functions learning possible data ability algorithm data sources data etc
alternative prediction algorithms given section
however give popular random field algorithm along follows
inference any model tree typically approximation loss over any feature input possible but only output features model structure hidden variables
prediction algorithm not limited models any loss function arbitrary features data
all prediction problems into binary prediction problems binary classifier applied strong theoretical good binary classification performance good prediction performance
simple applications standard prediction problems performance
moreover apply more complex prediction problems achieve empirical performance
