well know classification used wide variety problems but limited applications time series forecasting context
paper propose forecasting method specifically designed prediction application algorithm
practical applications method also presented
introduction
time series forecasting problem many applications etc
many methods designed time series forecasting perform well depending complexity problem rather but rather one
due fact methods usually designed performance at short term their use at term being not
furthermore they generally out prediction single value while real problem requires predicting vector future values one step
example case some known could predict all values whole
but forecasting vector requires either more complex models potential loss performance some vector components many distinct single value predicting models potential loss correlation information between various values
methods able whole vector same each its components thus interest
while prediction primary interest there some limit accuracy expected
due information itself not possible forecasting methods
indeed there no forecasting method used predicting at long term i e many time more difficult predicting at short term because information unknown future time those between known value one predict
at some term all prediction methods will thus
method presented paper not time accurate predictions could expected but rather about future evolution series
mean some information interest even if does not mean accurate predictions
example there bounds future values
what average
confidence future values large
predicting many could way known sequence then using any prediction method
however case loss information used even higher due lower known sequence
furthermore solution does not allow general way introduce stochastic method key issue proposed method
indeed about future evolution series through some statistics expected mean confidence etc several predictions should made order statistics
predictions should stochastic prediction method able generate several
method presented paper stochastic method results use random probability
another method presented paper used predict values vectors same expected each component case vector prediction
having at time series values prediction vector defined follows } where size vector predicted data process number past values influence future values noise vector
past values vector called
knowledge values time series means relation known many time past
modeling problem then estimate function models time series whole set past
idea method space
seen way make possible local modeling each
part method using
obtained each class model corresponding class
furthermore order take into account temporal series
those vectors differences between two
set also using
those two spaces their characterized simulations performed
using procedure simulations then possible estimate distribution simulations global time series at long term
though could chosen some other classical vector method only clustering property interest here choice perform two spaces fact efficient fast compared other methods limited complexity they provide representation
following paper first some basic about classification
then introduce proposed forecasting method vector time series then vector ones
next present some experimental results both vector
method stability given
