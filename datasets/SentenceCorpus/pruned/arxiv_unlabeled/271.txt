introduction
estimation time delay delay between times two signals same source but along different problem
time series could instance represent over many years very very source usually few
some appear set multiple due fact source way result various resulting detection several
phenomenon called natural prediction general theory objects thus them
variable sources same sequence at different times different according time along various
time delay between signals depends thus most direct method measure distribution often
underlying pattern time all noise processes
example time series not only noise but they also typically large data
due practical observation conditions among many other factors
over systems known about been long some cases time delay been
here focus first
source pair here b been over years despite value time delay system not
paper presented analysis observations along data generated according properties observations show approach improve upon popular methods time real data
more common form observations however known sources observations problems require our previous approach
here present approach datasets our previous well alternative approaches use
here introduce novel evolutionary algorithm estimate parameters method time delay estimation
uses function mean error given observed data also novel procedure based value
our population also represented types
paper several i evolutionary algorithm been introduced form novel our kernel method method been proposed estimate time delay kernel parameters application model based problem study statistical results different data
our evolutionary technique presence data representation through two populations each one particular data type
parameters kernel machine
do parameter model selection at same time
approach applied other problems not only time series
instance data problems those cases where observations factors involved etc
therefore data use analysis
problems data occur almost all where data what e g see
compare performance our several performance our method against two most popular methods literature i e method based structure function intrinsic source here method
because true time delay observed not known performance algorithms series experiments where generated data known used
three data large scale data data data
our approach also paper
our statistical analysis shows results our more accurate significant than methods
use our well algorithm actual observations where were observed over several years
paper data under analysis described
kernel approach presented
results our
finally our future work presented
