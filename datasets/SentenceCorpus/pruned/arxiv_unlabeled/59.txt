research regression statistics methods machine learning research et al et al et al
attention recent years due its potential applications many domains information et al et al et al image et al protein
number machine learning methods been developed address regression problem et al including its generalization neural network et al et al process et al large classifier support vector machine et al et al classifier algorithm et al et al classification et al regression et al et al bayesian et al binary classification approach original regression problem into set binary optimization cost functions et al
most methods into two approach et al et al et al approach
full relation into order constraints
latter learn multiple data into
approaches also under general extended binary classification framework
regression methods different
approach binary algorithm situation fast online algorithm
however like standard method its accuracy when data while kernel version problem
one class accurate classifier approaches et al into number data points constraints structural risk
thus not applied size datasets data points without some preference
may also noise due pairs
other class classifier methods support vector regression finding real data into
size optimization problem linear number training examples
however like support vector machine used classification prediction when solution not sparse makes not appropriate tasks
another approach process method also difficulty large training datasets problem prediction some situations
here describe new neural network approach regression neural network learning both online training very large et al data good performance prediction
our method considered generalization learning into neural network regression
our method also related linear models e g model regression
neural network method et al pairs examples learn order our method individual data points uses multiple output nodes estimate probabilities
thus our method into approach
learning our method neural networks using et al
same datasets our method performance better than standard classification neural networks methods using support vector processes
addition our method learn very large datasets make predictions
