paper propose two simple yet effective methods
first method explicitly every graph design graph kernel positive negative
second method construct graphs matrices propose efficient graph kernel information
proposed methods experiments
introduction
learning each training example
positive if contains at least one positive instance negative
although training known however unknown
goal construct
learning been found useful domains image image computer detection etc
advantage learning fact many real objects structures representation able represent objects more more information than simply using representation
example image into several
contrast whole image if represent each part instance then information if e g each part region additional information representation may make learning task
not good idea apply learning techniques since if representation sufficient using representation just
even tasks where objects structures should power representation exists its ability some structure information
however previous studies learning typically fact among important structure information
above image task different image samples more than them samples
actually independent better performance expected if
way among
paper propose two learning methods do not
samples
our basic idea each whole components
experiments show our proposed methods achieve highly learning methods
