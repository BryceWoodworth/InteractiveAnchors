paper propose activation approach
using process similarity between any obtained
algorithm higher accuracy than standard using correlation
furthermore introduce free parameter objects
numerical results influence popular objects further improve accuracy
argue better algorithm should require less generate higher accuracy
further propose algorithm involving only similar each target both less computational complexity higher accuracy }
introduction
growth people information
too much data able out information most appropriate us
way provide out information
systems use help them more identify interest potentially set choices
practical various algorithms been proposed methods methods analysis principle component analysis methods so
review current see

one most systems called been developed investigated over past
when predicting potential given approach first set similar past then makes prediction based combination those similar
despite its wide applications several major including system accuracy
recently some physical dynamics including model found their applications
physical approaches been demonstrated both high accuracy low computational complexity
however accuracy computational complexity may very statistics data sets
example algorithm presented
much than standard if number much larger than objects while when number objects advantage algorithm because its complexity determined number objects see

order increase system accuracy standard introduce algorithm activation
addition two free parameters presented increase accuracy
