paper several both sparse signal measurements b sense
sparse set measurements
develop novel methods solve both cases sufficient conditions exact case when unknown system i e all known order
setting out both measurements under certain conditions support structure
our main idea through linear time system sequential measurements
chosen its associated matrix property
develop novel optimization algorithm show both unknown sparse input estimated
