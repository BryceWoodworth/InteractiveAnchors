introduction
component analysis popular data processing dimension reduction
been widely used applications biology image processing machine learning so
example recently been applied human recognition classification gene expression data analysis see
at finding few linear original variables called components point much variables possible
well known found via matrix
however typically unknown practice
instead via value data matrix sample matrix
let random vector data matrix observations
without loss assume means all
then used sample matrix
then corresponding vectors
also obtained see example
vectors moreover
thus see if corresponding they correlated each other see section
now describe several important properties obtained standard when well estimated see also 1 maximum variables thus information loss much 2 so different small point their vectors each other
practice typically first few represent data thus reduction
due features usually linear all variables typically
makes often difficult especially when large
indeed many applications original variables physical
example biology each variable might represent expression level gene
cases would if they were only small number original variables each involved small number
thus develop sparse techniques finding sparse while above three properties much possible
sparse been active research more than
first class approaches based methods obtained standard above
example applied various techniques standard sparse vectors
proposed simple approach setting standard values smaller than threshold
recent years optimization approaches been proposed finding sparse
they usually sparse into optimization problem at while much possible
instance et al \ proposed algorithm called finding sparse vectors approximate each under norm vectors
et al \ sparse optimization problem combination norm regression
et al \ proposed method called finding sparse sequence program sparse
recently developed approach sparse sequence matrix approximation problems under several
very recently et al \ sparse maximization problems norm
they showed problems reduced into maximization convex function set they also proposed simple but efficient method finding point latter problems
methods were investigated sparse et al \ et al \
obtained above methods usually sparse
however properties standard some extent sparse
indeed likely correlation among sparse not considered methods
therefore their sparse correlated each other
also total methods too there may some among individual sparse
finally vectors sparse given methods lack
paper propose new sparse taking into account three properties standard total vectors
also explore standard show certain standard
further propose novel method class optimization problems well our sparse
method classical method i values functions at their approximate given method parameters see section
show method point moreover point under some assumptions
also propose two methods class functions over convex set applied our method
further global convergence under local error bounds assumption local linear rate convergence methods
finally compare sparse approach proposed paper several existing methods random real data
computational results demonstrate sparse obtained our approach those other methods terms total correlation vectors
paper follows
section propose new sparse explore standard
section then develop novel method class problems propose two methods class functions over convex set
section discuss our method sparse
sparse approach proposed paper then compared several existing methods random real data section
finally present some section
