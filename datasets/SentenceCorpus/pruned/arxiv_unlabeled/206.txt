when number classes large between given different likely occur case may total
study describe how consistent obtained despite discuss possible process terms human
define notion between number consistent obtained number provided distributed
show depends between number data seen single number classes
suggest several algorithms distributed problem analyze their function
addition provide bound case show approaches between number each provides number classes i e
introduction
applications machine learning larger training sets required both terms number training number classes considered
recent years example related tasks object class recognition detection
specifically object class recognition current data sets include classes
consistent data sets size task
up leads distributed provided large number
example system researchers while game
turn distributed several practical may data
general while single relatively though not not case multiple
different may differences their systems due several
first different may use different words describe same class
example one may use while other uses describe same class
same may used two describe two different classes hence one may use describe while other uses describe
similar problems occur when different data different levels so one over all while other between etc
finally often do not exact so may one while other
all become number classes increased thus their leads learning performance
paper study cost consistent while specific distributed only some described above present
distributed nature problem assume large data set examples set where each at most data points
while there between classes used different assume their systems so class one may another
later paper assumption consider case consistency exists between different
both scenarios various problem domains
consider example system large set including different people
since not they give classes
case consistency distributed between many different but only few
between concept not our current analysis distributed
another related our analysis extended relatively case initial data
consider example task site like into large training data set
our suggested algorithms analysis apply case
