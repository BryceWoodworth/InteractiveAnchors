introduction
recent studies shown despite actual remains long time
thus cognitive systems been proposed order
secondary their environment hence they able primary
three key design active research cognitive networks distributed between
previous studies various aspects
performance terms investigated when their knowledge
work studies performance different while spatial methods proposed probability
other aspects discussed
furthermore also increased attention eg
dynamic approach proposed allow their time while taking into account factor any
work practice time networks large performance
authors model problem game propose learning algorithms find correlated game
solutions dynamic also proposed while taking into account changes environment new among others
when multiple
one hand high
other hand effective rate when many over most available
system
therefore should explore transmission other if available transmission same all time
both frequency more time continuous transmission would among multiple conditions not long
objective paper design mechanism efficient among
model cognitive networks game
out
at each each based its view past history
knowledge other secondary limited due distributed nature network
resulting thus dynamic game information
gains
all who outcome
also choose out so current case no
at end each information made available all turn
achieve efficient learning algorithm proposed based outcome past
each local actions objective increasing its cost
demonstrated through simulations proposed distributed algorithm where always game both single networks
order approach practice
due different functional cognitive signaling under within including systems
cognitive attention potential techniques between secondary primary communication systems well mechanism support data across networks
common control used provide information corresponding given area
thus control outcome
main paper problem cognitive networks game
distributed learning algorithm proposed networks learning algorithm investigated networks
