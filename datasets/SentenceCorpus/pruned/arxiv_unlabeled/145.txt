associations appear four distinct tasks distinct algorithms
past four tasks been using wide variety algorithms
four classes however sample full range cannot algorithms each need approach
propose range under
limit paper our attention associations
introduce machine learning algorithm pairs show solve questions questions questions questions cognitive
introduction
pair words another pair when between words first pair highly similar second pair
two words context when they they when they they associated when they tend
four distinct classes distinct algorithms but propose approach all four
associations under
when pair pair when they pair associated when they pair
there past work associations but each four tasks been examined others
far know algorithm proposed here first all four tasks using approach
important algorithms range because algorithm each phenomenon very research strategy
might contains all information need four tasks
however take approach
used answer questions accuracy but best approach accuracy
another approach approach requires less human thus other
section describe our algorithm
use standard machine learning approach feature vectors based patterns large
use support vector machine learn how feature vectors
section four sets experiments
apply our algorithm questions test questions test second practice questions set pairs similar associated both developed experiments cognitive
discuss results experiments section
accuracy algorithm other systems but algorithm able all four tasks no learning parameters particular task
well although against algorithms developed single tasks
related work examined section future work considered section
