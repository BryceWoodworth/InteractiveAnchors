paper introduce class prediction strategies construct prediction algorithm well best continuous strategy
make assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about environment
particular no assumption made about environment considered strategies only means they do not depend explicitly argue natural consider only strategies even highly environments
introduction
paper area learning theory been prediction prediction prediction individual sequences universal see review
there many techniques known paper based algorithm but possible some other techniques could used instead
section give main state our main results their given
section discuss notion section
