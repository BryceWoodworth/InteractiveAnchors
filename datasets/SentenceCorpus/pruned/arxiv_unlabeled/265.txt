common assume certain structure payoff functions
assumptions type natural many applications often lead efficient learning algorithms
particular work some information similarity between available
paper consider similarity information setting natural basic problem where before each algorithm given context about payoffs

lower bound very general every given similarity space every fixed value bound
our stochastic setting specifically applied described above similarity information per
first one across time each them across each time
analysis bounds
particular one main results
second our setting stochastic problem where each some i e not available
here
corresponding result
third following version paper been applied version problem change expected payoffs each eg small amount each
fact significant constraints across time each across each time } setting our those
our algorithm analysis more general setting where some pairs may moreover arbitrary metric pairs } apply problem change expected payoffs each eg small amount each
setting problem context simply
then expected payoff at time context metric provides bound temporal change
term
problem significant constraints both across time each across each best our knowledge models literature
special cases include change per behavior random
