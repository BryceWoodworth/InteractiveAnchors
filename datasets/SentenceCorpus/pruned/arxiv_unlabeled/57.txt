introduction
consider design optimal i e communication network convergence rate average
average distributed algorithm been considered his see also found application recently several subject active research e
g
design networks not much attention literature
consider classes random graphs particular
more general question convergence rate under number network was considered our previous work where reduced average problem distributed inference see also
networks under model network random field
specifically assume network then paper our convergence results networks random
recent paper similar model convergence properties using stochastic matrices
network also algorithms where only single pair selected at each communication nodes
our use multiple selected at each design optimal i e optimal weight not simple average optimal probabilities communication there communication cost
other recent work continuous time networks communication studies distributed when network complete graph probabilities all
