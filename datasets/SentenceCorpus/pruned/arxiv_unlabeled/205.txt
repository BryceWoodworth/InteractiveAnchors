introduction
while available via provides options through alternatives identify choices
systems process similar individuals
at system algorithm predicts whether given will like various based his past behavior other
algorithms example wide use systems including those
algorithm each history may include instance his decisions
predict whether particular will like particular algorithm number other similar
prediction then generated based how
prediction could example average past
because decisions systems they become targets
instance multiple online use each rate his own highly
example system was so who were
although may not been systems
research literature further empirical evidence algorithms
order one might consider each number limit number
may effective some situations
however do not financial would
one might also consider using only data when they available basis because they likely generated
quality may however if data also
paper understand extent performance systems how algorithms should designed their influence
find while algorithms algorithms out predictions based particular class probabilistic models robust
will explain paper will algorithms linear algorithms
find rates increasing number average accuracy predictions made linear algorithm data
instance even if all provided who predictions long will average
provide some why our results should now
robust algorithm should learn its
particular differences between its predictions actual should help improve predictions future
linear algorithm predictions based probability distribution convex combination two one would learn given only data generated one would learn given only data
whose predict provides more clear two distributions better his preferences
result weight data
main theoretical result paper above
particular will define notion bound particularly simple n n before
our analysis will also study algorithms like linear algorithms size training set
class algorithms linear more modeling assumptions may improve prediction accuracy
will version our bound linear algorithms linear algorithms
will also show our bound does not generally algorithms
because prediction errors do not always improve selection
particular provides more data predictions his future may set while data generated may
result predictions may not
will later provide example
addition theoretical results paper provides empirical analysis using available set generated system
produce version data set generated using technique studied prior literature
then compare results application three algorithm linear algorithm called kernel density estimation algorithm linear algorithm called algorithm
results demonstrate while performance algorithm highly those kernel density estimation algorithms relatively robust
particular latter two experience lower than theoretical bound provide whereas far
one might also whether robustness algorithm at its prediction accuracy
example consider algorithm predictions all constant without training data
algorithm but likely predictions therefore not useful
our experiments accuracy demonstrated three algorithms all seems
suggests accuracy algorithm may robustness
our theoretical empirical results together suggest systems using algorithms made more robust approaches describe
note not systems should specific algorithms present paper
rather our analysis properties algorithms lead robustness may taking properties into when systems
paper follows
