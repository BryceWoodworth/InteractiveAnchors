introduction
universal data single optimal performance all sources within given family
suggests good universal should accurate model source statistics long data sequence knowledge its
been made
under his data binary representation each source two 1 estimate source parameters 2 data resulting where length
paper idea vector
sources values some finite
specifically let
source distribution some class continuous distributions where subset some
measures our main result theorem states if class certain conditions then there exists sequence optimal each source class exact identification active source respect distance defined where over all
rate where length while active source identified up almost
also describe our measures certain condition present two examples conditions theorem
while most existing universal rely identification active source e g through large numbers clustering our model mechanism data then appropriate data basis model
ability model data may prove useful applications where parameter could represent evidence aim data way evidence later high version
another key feature our approach use theory order universal class sources certain decision regions associated sources
way estimates thought method types finite
