introduction
study problem applications control
given measurements over time problem estimate hidden state object
do measurements multiple time prior knowledge about state dynamics goal produce estimates close true states possible
most popular solutions problem their eg based framework problem
state object at time given only vectors
approach state measurements random variables
represent our knowledge dynamics states using transition process our knowledge relationship between states observations process
then given only observations goal estimate hidden state sequence
likelihood each state sequence then using estimate either sequence probability maximum expected value state respect distribution bayesian algorithm
practice one uses approximation bayesian algorithm
problem framework practice very difficult determine distributions measurements
moreover bayesian algorithm very model using model different model measurements lead large between estimated states true states
address introduce framework
our framework called framework given set state sequences state but instead observations generated } model set each mechanism observations
how observations generated
} proposed observations } measure quality using loss function depends only measurements not hidden true state
algorithm its own taking average best according past observations
theoretical provide loss generated online way algorithm close minimum loss measured according loss function algorithm
analysis used online learning important note any sequence observations any probabilistic assumptions
our next provide algorithm framework
our algorithm based general online learning algorithm any loss function
when loss function produce loss close minimum loss set
directly apply derive sequential approximation show approximation efficient
demonstrate robustness our algorithm perform simulations simple problem
evaluate performance average distance between states estimated algorithms true hidden states
our algorithm simple loss function
our simulations show our algorithm bayesian algorithm under high noise wide range levels model
note bayesian algorithm also framework
particular if loss negative under some model then bayesian algorithm shown produce close minimum
one may our solution follows same however point our paper one use loss functions different particular show using other loss functions better performance than bayesian algorithm its
paper follows
