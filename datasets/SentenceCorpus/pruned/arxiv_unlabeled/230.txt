introduction
matching problem fundamental problem optimization
problem finding graph
exact optimal solution found time standard methods algorithm
problem practical interest because model applications
example computer problem finding between sets image features often matching problem
algorithms based matching framework clustering algorithms
when modeling problem one matching one central question choice weight matrix
problem real applications typically feature vectors not weights
consider example computer difficult what between two image feature points but feature vectors e g associated those points
setting natural whether could features use order estimate parameters given graphs features their resulting also
idea then data called estimation
describe estimation problem
they loss one about loss example
however losses typically constant parameters any using optimization directly
instead loss convex bound loss
practice results often good but known convex produce i e algorithm general obtain best model limit training data
support vector issue literature recently
well having full probabilistic model paper present maximum matching problem
observed data feature vectors provided training
then likelihood given observed data
family model where sufficient statistics distribution prediction solution matching problem
resulting function
however show learning rank applications model instance
then compare performance our model instance against large number methods including approach only our model instance using instead
show very results standard datasets particular show our model better than
model show problem using sampling provide experiments computer domain
however still large models case matching like those likely even their potential accuracy
