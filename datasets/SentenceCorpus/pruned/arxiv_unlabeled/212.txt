object detection many applications
since proposed first based detection system much effort been method
work first show feature selection methods other than also used training efficient object
particular introduce sparse linear analysis its computational better detection performance compared
moreover propose new technique sparse linear analysis detection
sample property criterion
experiments domain highly data distributions detection proposed its
finding provides significant argue similar approaches not only methods achieve high classification results high data object detection
introduction
detection detection computer applications based systems based image
various been proposed literature
object detection due visual conditions
furthermore object detection classification task
natural image contains many more negative patterns than object patterns
number patterns times larger than number object patterns
means if one achieve high detection rate together low detection rate one specific classifier
classifier distribution into
because based work been proposed
most them focused underlying method training process
example was introduced context highly example distribution
proposed better detection accuracy feature step into training procedure
used feature selection fast training
another technique based statistics input data was used even training
was proposed strong classifier
based linear features
therefore detection phase not efficient features
classifier design feature selection
work part was form propose learning algorithm detection sparse linear analysis
introduced framework features training manner shown
framework allows most before resulting fast performance
test image reported only if tests all nodes
way most early nodes
lead very fast detection high detection rates
also been used context support vector detection
developed reduce training design complexity
idea was further developed
original work
one issue system use algorithm training nodes
modeling loss function
algorithm produce strong classifier high classification accuracy
small subset them
linear combination decision classifier space
proposed original following aspects
instead decision error proposed algorithm new criterion
result selected during learning process according criterion
our technique following aspects
proposed concept linear classifier learning goal framework
our work where features selected based linear analysis criterion features using algorithm
given selected features then optimal linear classifier learning goal using
note similar techniques also been applied neural network
adaptive network linear output been introduced
input data into space classes more
since number training samples each class at output neural network hidden been shown increase classification accuracy problem class
our experiments show terms feature selection proposed methods than object detection } key work follows
introduce alternative approach training
similar results obtained compared approach
propose new algorithm sample typically used into
experiments show achieve better detection
show feature selection classifier training techniques different objective functions other words two processes context training visual
more even better performance
previous based approaches features classifier
our results consider highly data distribution when training
learning criterion data information
hence better than standard loss training object
paper follows
section algorithm introduced alternative learning technique object detection problems
then discuss how data information when training classifier section
then proposed algorithm described training time complexity discussed
experimental results shown section paper section
