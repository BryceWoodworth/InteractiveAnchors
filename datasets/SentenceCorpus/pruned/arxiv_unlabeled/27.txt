simple result problem regression loss class continuous prediction strategies prediction not only at least well any continuous strategy but also property loss any continuous strategy determined how leading strategy
more specifically any class prediction strategies kernel space construct leading strategy sense loss any prediction strategy whose norm not too large determined how leading strategy
result extended loss functions given rules
introduction
function class prediction strategies
well known under some there exists prediction also called almost well best strategies whose norm not too large see eg
prediction paper loss any prediction strategy whose norm not too large loss leading strategy between predictions output two prediction strategies
therefore leading strategy standard prediction strategies whose norm not too prediction strategy small loss degree its predictions leading predictions only way leading strategy practical point view strategies much more than leading strategies although existence leading strategies very fact simple result existence leading strategies problem regression loss function class continuous prediction strategies
state version result introduce several general used paper
following two two loss functions given rules
prediction typically making any stochastic assumptions about way observations generated but consider comparison case where observations generated
section contains most related literature although there paper
some given found full version paper

section % general possible further research
there many techniques strategies strong algorithms following forecasting just few
paper will use forecasting proposed based much work
strategies using forecasting properties required leading other hand not clear whether leading strategies using other techniques
