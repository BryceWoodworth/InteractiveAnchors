classification method presented first then energy function
outcome fixed independent number many
methods applied context learning
introduction
field numbers interest classification because its structure
amount work finding data representation e g \
use more general numbers data was order able include case into without having larger number
was applied special case data words over given where words defined length common initial part
there clustering algorithm was described
however question finding optimal data was not
performance classical classification algorithms was compared
was observed ones were often more efficient
learning algorithms using neural networks described
our main article will adaptation method data
authors where described first
their method find then group data
next step more clusters obtained
process class number
data approach does not make first all general not because determined data arbitrary choice not lead
hence first find direction energy reduction class number bound
they energy
result method classification given into its
first all i e \ clusters energy below threshold value
choice out useful % efficient
first application some methods described here event history data described
there classification algorithm performed different data order compare dynamics some
after section describe classical method section
section task setting corresponding algorithms
issue choice section
section adaptive learning method clusters large energy
