proposed approach two main 1 belief likelihood each based upon our ability predict previous observations 2 potential comparing current belief against threshold
threshold based available feedback end
our algorithms universal prediction recent work online convex do not require distributions given all current observations involve simple parameter
at proposed approach models used wide variety applications methods achieve regret against both distributions same family
moreover regret against distributions value corresponding online strongly convex game
also prove bounds number made during step relative best choice threshold all estimated feedback signals
theory data distribution over binary vectors high well detection individual sequences prediction regret online convex prediction limited feedback sequential probability universal prediction
introduction
paper explore performance online detection methods sequential probability dynamic based limited feedback
assume state some system interest
at each time step version current state need whether relative actual sequence past states
inference binary decision either behavior behavior
after our decision may feedback state use future behavior decision-making mechanism
our inference should make good use feedback available improve its future performance
one way do follows
having observed but not use observation state
let us likelihood
then if actually had observation could evaluate if where some positive would set no at time
approach based idea new observation should if very based our past knowledge
other words observations considered if they observation domain very low likelihood according best probability model them basis previously seen observations fact detection algorithms based density level sets here however do not actually but rather its version
thus instead estimate based compare estimate against
if feedback at time our then threshold
