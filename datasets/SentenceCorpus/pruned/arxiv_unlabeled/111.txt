introduction
task predicting preferences given some e g people etc based previously revealed form well revealed preferences other
system example one would like suggest new based what other recently
goal preferences order them new objects
number methods been developed past
recently there been interest using regularization based methods
work literature novel general approach regularization based methods
recent regularization based methods assume only data available revealed preferences where no other information information objects given
case one may problem observed preference matrix each each object e g matrix represent given given object
when only information available set observed unknown matrix must known ones there typically very few relative size matrix
make useful predictions within setting regularization based methods make certain assumptions about objects
most common assumption preferences into small number factors both objects resulting search matrix observed matrix preferences
rank regularization hypothesis space
since rank set matrices associated optimization problem will difficult problem only heuristic algorithms exist
alternative proposed suggests predicted matrix its norm i e its values
norm regularization large regularization parameter solution will
however key current regularization based methods they do not take advantage information attributes e g objects e g often available
information might useful inference preferences particular objects very few known
example at objects no prior not considered standard while their attributes could provide some basic preference inference
main paper develop general framework specific algorithms also based novel more general setting where other information attributes objects may available
more show while typically seen problem matrix thought more generally linear space space objects
learning form between objects
then develop regularization based methods learn linear
when rather than matrices one may also work dimension one consider arbitrary feature space some kernel function
among key theoretical paper new us develop new general methods learn many parameters even when feature space
classical theorem empirical loss norm kernel space more general functions function classes
also show appropriate choice both objects may consider number existing machine learning methods special cases our general framework
particular show several methods rank optimization regularization those based norm regularization all special cases regularization spaces
moreover particular choices lead specific matrix learning
specific application presence attributes show our generalization leads better predictive performance
paper follows
section review notion space show how problem within framework
then introduce regularization discuss how rank norm regularization norm regularization all special cases regularization
section show how our general framework many existing methods choices loss function
section provide three estimation regularization allow efficient learning algorithms
finally section present number algorithms describe several techniques improve
test algorithms section examples widely used database
