introduction
% first models way describe explain relationships among set variables central data analysis
principle should model data
paper practical ways following approach finding given set data solve maximum likelihood problem norm make resulting graph sparse possible
many authors studied variety related
case model selection involves finding pattern matrix since among variables
search algorithm used determine pattern
however data even number variables
introduce algorithm they account matrix loss function negative likelihood function
recently considered maximum likelihood estimation proposed set large scale methods problems where pattern given one must estimate elements matrix
another way estimate model find set each graph variable against variables
stochastic algorithm variables
there also been interest using norm statistical applications
apply norm sparse principle component analysis
directly related our problem use obtain very short each graph
study approach show resulting consistent even graphs
problem data therefore simple
difficulty its
although problem convex set
see resulting complexity existing point methods where number variables distribution
addition point methods require at each step size
memory complexity thus higher than
algorithms needed larger problems
paper follows
