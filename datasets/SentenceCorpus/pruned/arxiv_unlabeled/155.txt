paper statistical concept prediction arbitrary probability density functions feature level distributions provides probabilities continuous random variables
advantage probability density function into level distribution classification detection direct manner
introduction
prediction will degree confidence contain future pattern recognition feature vectors
concept its clear stochastic
usually too example distributions
clear case more than one feature vectors exist would better prediction regions
even more situation feature
lack why prediction used pattern recognition
actually because prediction regions would very useful example recognition detection
instead prediction other methods used
they into two approaches methods introduce class combination classifier
if method i propose here detection first probability
before into i will give short related
simple methods rely concept point example
those points there less than points within distance
propose method choose threshold based upon
idea consider set points their
here also threshold necessary but now statistical distance distribution choice
more recent article based idea who apply per point
although idea simple methods low
furthermore they make only assumptions about underlying distribution
another algorithms related detection robust regression
detection here more means end because goal influence estimation regression function
means case sufficient
example apply control influence point parameter estimation process regression function
weights introduced estimated based assumption noise distributed
often sufficient example most signals
algorithm but far
method also one
idea second very different
at first seems use because need estimation their parameters samples
usually only samples available
idea samples random
possible classifier
example apply neural network
other also possible example
applied classifier probabilistic methods need measure degree generated sample point
example use simple prediction
both solve same find appropriate level set density
i will show problem choice level possible statistical concept prediction prediction regions
