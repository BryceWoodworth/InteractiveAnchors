one particular feature
introduction
consider data some distribution unknown
likelihood function contain complete statistical information sample
often information various communication computational mathematical etc
parameter estimation hypothesis testing model complexity selection all ways information different ways context
might either single point e g \ mean stochastic model selection convex set e g \ confidence finite set points mixture models sample points mean matrix approximation more general density estimation few other ways
i methods increasing order complexity
paper set estimation multiple point estimation hypothesis testing special cases hypothesis identification seems what will estimation testing simple complex but not density estimation
will set estimation at end
there many properties any hypothesis identification principle should
should lead good predictions what models defined make sense also \ data representation work simple work classes work estimation testing model selection reduce special cases existing other methods
here first will show resulting principle many other items
address problem good predictive performance
if true parameter then best prediction future observations
if know but prior belief about its distribution predictive distribution based past observations likelihood over weight best bayesian predictor often cannot use full discussed above but predict hypothesis i e \ use prediction
better prediction where measure some distance function
since assumed unknown average over them
predictive hypothesis identification losses t \ some hypothesis class
our general point estimation simple hypothesis testing mixture model complexity selection others
general idea inference predictive performance not new
indeed context model complexity selection machine learning empirical test set generalization see
there also number statistics predictive see
most them distribution free methods based some form measure often focus model selection
predictive likelihood including future observations
full decision based leads loss depending expected loss been studied but context hypothesis identification
natural estimation prediction action predictive distribution between parameter estimation optimal decision making
natural but i seen
indeed above no work
main paper investigate predictive losses above particular their i e \ best predictor
section global assumptions simple example
also shows
section states possible distance loss functions their section i study exact properties sufficient statistics
limit related
section large sample sequential
results used
section contains
paper example will general results main paper introduce demonstrate how difficult problem show how known certain
latter provides additional support previous their range
general treatment not
