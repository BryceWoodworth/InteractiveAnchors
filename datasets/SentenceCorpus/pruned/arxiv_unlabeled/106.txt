introduction
let set function any any through because they only data through hence through kernel
allows example perform classification regression graphs statistical methods positive kernel graphs defined
activity focused design specific positive specific data graphs applications natural processing
applications computational proposed recently kernel graphs more generally data into
kernel called optimal kernel measures similarity between two data points optimal matching between both points
natural notion similarity between graphs algorithm
however show below general not positive suggests special may needed before using kernel methods
should out not being positive not issue use kernel practice
first may fact positive when particular set data used practical experiment
second other positive kernel been shown very useful efficient combination kernel methods
third kernel methods developed variety strategies limit possible kernel methods when positive used matrix kernel values set positive matrices before processing
good results reported several indeed method
hence our note not use optimal kernel context kernel methods
instead some cases negative may appear matrix specific may needed error
