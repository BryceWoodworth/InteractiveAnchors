most theoretical work regression out loss where obtained through
paper use tools convex optimization literature functions provide simple theoretical results loss loss
apply techniques regression regularization norm regularization norm new results binary classification through regression derived corresponding results regression
introduction
theoretical analysis statistical methods usually when
methods based certain functional methods true when function i e context regression loss
when loss used results may derived classical tools probability theory see eg
when function not solutions local then needed solution optimization problem
results case eg consistency see eg
however situation different when one derive results i e results where all problem
indeed order prove results loss much many assumptions introduced second third makes derived results much more than ones
similar situation occurs convex optimization study method solutions optimization problems
known convex problems
however its classical analysis requires assumptions second eg
situation was introduction notion functions i e functions whose third their second
analysis much more
while method used algorithm eg leading algorithms focus paper optimization problems but statistical analysis associated global
paper aim tools convex optimization analyze statistical properties regression
since loss not itself function introduce new type functions different control third
functions prove two types first provide lower i e given function
second prove results behavior method similar ones functions
then apply them population solution corresponding problem i e regression
shows analysis regression using local approximation loss without complex additional assumptions
since approximation problem results regression thus extended
order consider make new results corresponding ones regression derive new concentration random variables obtained general results
first apply technique regularization norm where consider two settings situation no assumptions distribution observations another one where model assumed derive generalization performance bounds terms
consider regularization norm two known recent results loss one model consistency one prediction
