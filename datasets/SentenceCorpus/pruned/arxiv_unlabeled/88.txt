resulting prediction algorithm applied predict results
theoretical performance out rather data sets especially case more data
introduction
prediction was introduced see eg been applied various loss see recent review
especially important class loss functions ones loss made small best loss constant depending number
known optimal constant proposed use
there several important loss functions been shown optimal constant been found
examples case binary observations loss function loss function
loss function whose been along its important loss function
paper loss function
binary case its was demonstrated
there two natural result could observations real numbers regression standard problem statistics observations take values finite set leads defined below standard way quality predictions other applied see eg
loss function case observations real numbers was demonstrated et al algorithm was
case classification been framework prediction
