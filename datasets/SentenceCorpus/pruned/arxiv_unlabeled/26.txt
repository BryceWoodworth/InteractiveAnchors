introduction
probabilistic inference often consider stochastic define distributions over set all possible words over
general consider unknown distribution goal find good approximation given finite sample words
class probabilistic often used modeling distributions
class same hidden markov models limit
however there exists no efficient algorithm
fact there exists no representation makes difficult identify structure target
one solution focus probabilistic but important lack
another solution class
models representation good machine learning point view
define functions rational series values
generalization stochastic generated special cases rational stochastic
let us class rational stochastic parameters where
class stochastic generated parameters
but when obtain greater classes
provides several elements normal representation thus elements may significantly smaller representation parameters directly related probabilities some natural events form estimated stochastic when field rational series over form vector space efficient linear techniques used rational stochastic
however class there exists no subset class
no identification algorithm indeed identification algorithm samples would provide class rational stochastic over
result there exists efficient algorithm able identify limit
but before target produce do not define stochastic
however been shown probability one any rational stochastic if given input large sample according rational series 1
moreover size increases
show class rational series call rational
rational property defined any
stochastic associated way when
first when stochastic
second any rational stochastic if given input increasing samples according rational size increases
aim paper provide theoretical study class rational series experiments order compare performance two classical inference
show class rational within time
provide algorithm used any
also show how possible using
show there exist rational not rational
finally show whether two rational define same stochastic
out experiments show most cases
results were expected since not same theoretical since at representation target set significantly smaller than smaller if exists
paper follows
section 2 introduce some about rational series stochastic present algorithm
section our study stochastic
our experiments detailed section
