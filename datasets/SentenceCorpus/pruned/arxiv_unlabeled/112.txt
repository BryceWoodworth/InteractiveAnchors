show how models prediction defined using hidden markov models standard algorithms then used among other how predictions should according model
many existing models best known times each case
also describe two new distribution was recently developed improve description length model selection new fixed algorithm based
give loss bounds all models new their relationships
introduction
cannot predict how processes social interactions so will develop into future
people do make all time
predictions based models human
may even choose between basis combination
scenarios typically cannot considered
thus may well end up position where whole prediction strategies each some into some aspects process interest
address question how given set combined into single predictive strategy good if possible even better than best individual
follows
let finite set
each distribution next outcome given previous observations
here each outcome some space random variables
probability sequence outcomes given
standard bayesian approach predictions define prior distribution function
inference then based distribution
probability data b predictive distribution next outcome prediction strategy those individual c distribution us how predictions should
simple probabilistic approach advantage predicting outcomes using requires only time
bayesian strategy overall probability data only factor smaller than probability data according best available
strategy do any better than means potentially other not used our advantage
more prediction strategies found literature under various including bayesian statistics source universal prediction
latter predictions not probabilistic using arbitrary loss function
paper consider only loss although our results framework described eg \
introduce allows description existing new models
time evaluation models directly size their representation
