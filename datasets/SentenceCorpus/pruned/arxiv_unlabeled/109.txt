study problem small sample individuals mixture distributions over according their distributions
each distribution described vector
given two distributions use average distance across measures statistical between them
study case distributed across
work input instance certain optimization function correct high probability where graph over individuals whose between their corresponding vectors define weights so long
function where weight weights across all
result property feature one number features required size sample certain tasks like clustering
introduction
explore type classification problem context computational biology
problem given small sample size eg dna individuals each described values features eg single where
features different depending population individual assumed independent each other
given population individual represented vector paper assumed generated appropriate distribution
objective consider number features thus total data size individuals sample according their population given any
describe function features
paper use
first describe general mixture model use paper
same model was previously used probability over set
further components features independent
hence probability distribution features each populations
moreover input algorithm mixture samples points algorithm determine each data point was chosen
general do not assume revealed but do require some bounds their relative
important parameter probability measure between any two distributions
note provides lower bound distance between means any two distributions their
further let so if populations were would each type
paper following theorem sufficient condition input instance when
above theorem based model allows two random at each dimension all points given
there at each dimension given any pair individuals under assumption two random same distribution at each dimension
higher among pairs different groups than pairs same group across all
addition shows when given two each dimension one always any size cases any number using component based algorithms given graph described theorem
key paper show new use goal clustering same amount features while only one random at each dimension
while some theorem section single at each dimension
hence contain complete paper give complete
finding algorithm was given mixture given any shows
two algorithms using techniques were conditions above
both algorithms achieve bound theorem without input being work cases when however they require even when input instance shows
note when i e when sample each distribution only theorem
between when small theorem design both theoretical practical value }
