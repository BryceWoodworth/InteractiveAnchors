present novel approach learning based statistical
most work field learning points certain energy function solution
contrast methods estimate distribution instead more accurate robust results
our approach may applied all energy functions used learning
method based sampling using markov algorithm probabilistic allows points classes also yet class types
suggested approach demonstrated data set two data sets gene expression
introduction
situations many points available only few points provided call learning methods
goal learning points basis their distribution provided points
problems occur many data but
scenarios methods but presence few points significantly improve performance methods
basic assumption learning i e clustering points same actually same class
clustering methods based density data points define distribution i e relatively region relatively lower density
hence each assumed single class although certain class may over several
case well they identified techniques there no need methods
however consider case two close two different classes but density points between them not significantly lower than density within each
case density based methods may between classes while methods help
even if few points each class algorithms cannot together points different place between
most will between where density points lower
hence less differences between
example consider image
each data point similarity between value
while
classification into classes b
any method would data see eg c since two classes form one
however using few points methods must place between classes may become useful
recent years various types learning algorithms been proposed however almost all methods common basic approach
they define certain cost function i e energy over possible energy output energy classification their solution
different methods specific energy function their example work graph cost graph while others choose cost cost
recently energy basic common all robustness found solution
et al case several energy where one one solution instead them all
energy space may contain many energy considered et al but also other may robustness global minimum optimal solution
first may difference energy between global minimum close solutions thus minimum solution may arbitrary
many cases there too few data points both may empirical density true density
density may energy solution far correct one
example due low density may high density region may single two
another type may generate high density points low density region may two clusters different classes
both cases energy solution find correct classification
example latter case provided three methods appear classification due classes energy solution most classification
possible approach may then consider probability distribution all possible
et al provided first step direction using algorithm
work provide different solution based statistical
each solution our method its energy also known weight its probability given } where free parameter energy into account both points
classification then performed thus probability point class
often markov random field been applied including context learning
however they solution while estimate distribution itself at
using framework statistical several context first classification simple probabilistic
points class types may also confidence level classification
since probabilities most cases statistical developed markov methods systems
due complexity problems methods methods provide results one apply more algorithms discussed section
using statistical allows us gain nature problem i e allows detailed analysis effect points data set
addition our method also two practical i while most learning methods consider only case two class types our method extended another unique feature our method its ability suggest existence new class type did not appear set
our main objective paper present framework later applied different
example energy function any functions used other methods
paper use cost function
do not using cost function optimal indeed observed some cases
however aim our method any energy function would always better results than same energy function
our work related criterion learning first introduced framework statistical later graph context
method introduced work clustering algorithms case
