results was point series show any sequence outcomes learned no prior knowledge using some universal forecasting algorithm rules
show class all efficient rules property
moreover present probabilistic algorithm probability close one sequence all forecasting algorithms
according framework consider algorithms
introduction
let binary sequence outcomes observed whose task give probability future event
evaluation probability based method called following if any event time choose see also
let us give some
let set all binary sequences set all finite binary sequences sequence
any finite sequence
also length sequence
if finite sequence finite sequence then sequences means some
framework method probabilities future event all possible finite sequences
other words all probabilities i
