discuss online learning when decision tasks
tasks related actions taken decision certain constraints
give natural examples then discuss general class constraints introduce efficient ways actions problem
discuss problem model various ways including global losses sets tasks
introduction
learning recently attention see
learning problems one several tasks related some sense
relationship tasks been different ways literature
our setting decision action each given tasks manner each tasks game will use game task some constraints actions
example consider several its
choose
loss does not would been best
basic suggest given similar should not very different so
additional may limit further set may
after out responses observed at least new selected
model situations many games vector actions selected at time previously given set
set determined constraints discussed above
goal decision total regret across many games through time perform long almost well best constant vector actions
problem several games been considered who studies convergence but does not address issue computational when large number games
learning problems were also studied
latter reference consider regret however some constraints
measure total loss losses each game but assume all tasks performed at each assumption however section where consider global losses more general than losses main additional difficulty decision subset vectors actions
previous models were only considered comparison class but not way decision
problem framework regret see
main construct strategy many games small regret strategy computational complexity
show various natural examples computational problem may reduced online problem associated graph efficient algorithms exist however propose specific more effective results extended case goal decision perform well best strategy change vector actions taken set at limited number times
also consider version problem when decision instead losses all actions all games only losses chosen actions
finally also consider cases when there many tasks real numbers
cases decision function certain class functions
show examples natural cases consider many tasks discuss computational related theory exact simulation markov
average because when compared its most likely algorithms they better performance especially case feedback
two out usually same order
