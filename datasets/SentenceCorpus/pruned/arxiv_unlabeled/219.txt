introduction
prediction recognition methods systems random environment both spatial temporal global behavior observations
example network one fixed data estimation overall situation its evolution
image recognition visual event detection some sense information between different sets one
natural probabilistic information markov random field probabilities prediction recognition process
inference problem constraints address system variables only known statistical information form probabilities set
typically result some empirical procedure data
based information consider then situation where some variables observed subset while other one set remains hidden
what prediction made set how fast make prediction if terms real time applications like prediction example
since variables take their values over finite set probabilities described finite set following principle maximum entropy distribution data best probability distribution form } representation factor graph where function each variable addition call
together define factor graph will assumed
there two main problem how set parameters order constraints data
inference how sense most efficient real information terms probabilities
exact generally complexity problem both one approximate
approximation used statistical approximate version free energy associated
computer belief algorithm procedure allows exact probabilities when underlying graph tree
when graph still possible apply procedure then belief rather good accuracy sparse graphs
however there may several fixed points either stable
been shown points points free energy defined addition stable fixed points local free energy
question convergence been series conditions bounds having global convergence
present work
since procedure performed best data one output information when all variables hidden
actually been proposed where specific case model i e \ approximate version better results
will later section when will compare various possible approximate models within framework
paper propose new approach based multiple fixed points identification able both procedure consistent way real time applications
paper our inference strategy detailed section problem inference binary variables distribution follows mixture present some numerical section some where mean field become relevant direct model
section propose model well continuous optimization allows performance model
finally section comparing our approach other perspective future
