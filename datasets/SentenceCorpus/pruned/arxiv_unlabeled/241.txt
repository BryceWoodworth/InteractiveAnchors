introduction
several studies related machine learning recently been
main idea been based generalization probability distribution obtained using density matrix matrix one
basic probability rule called probability using density matrix clustering other machine learning algorithms based theory
combined maximization probabilistic modeling approach detection estimation theory
proposed markov random field using density matrix applied image
bayesian framework based density matrix also been proposed
proposed density between two probability
et al rule case where prior was density matrix bayesian probability density matrices rules between
typically derived generalization theory special case when density matrices been
full distributions over model parameters probabilistic models eg remains difficult bayesian well classical bayesian
paper inference widely used framework probabilistic models based been used
inference been widely used approximation bayesian inference probabilistic models variables
example probabilistic mixture model mixture each data point class variable corresponding data point class
optimization algorithm cost function
cost function called negative free energy function variables
called cost function paper
since algorithm similar maximization algorithm local optimal problem practice
algorithms been proposed algorithm based issue local
called based
one most well known based approaches machine learning
based concept statistical called
parameter
because energy at high change state see
however state at low because energy transition probability very low
therefore does not find global practical
attention alternative method optimization problems process
expected help states being local at low
main point paper explain novel algorithm based derived present effects obtained through experiments
generalization using density matrix
describe our terms density matrix section
here derived
although density matrix algorithm finally derived does not need density matrix only simple changes algorithm
since does not find global still need multiple different random where number
here let us consider not multiple where means multiple interaction among see b
class states data points
independent very low transition probability among states i e they been at high shown c while dependent changes state situation
because interaction i e increases makes approach each other state will then into
if there better state states independent find dependent expected work well
dependent just where interaction above derived mechanisms will following section
paper follows
