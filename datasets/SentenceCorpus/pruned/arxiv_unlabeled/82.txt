note show how method maximum entropy mean may used improve estimation when measurements large level noise
method developed context estimation parameter distribution
compare performance our method bayesian maximum likelihood approaches
introduction
you measure some some other random variable distribution time life time process
assume well noise process random variable whose may same order rate measured
make assume you only very few measurements
if value variable one only measure where small noise
other words assume you know sample specific distribution but noise
what do
one possible approach apply small sample statistical estimation
but designed problems where due only random nature there no other noise still another one explore here apply method estimate both unknown variable noise level
problem problem } where convex set some matrix depends how our problem
could example consider following find } our case set could consider problems one every then estimation
problem
what important here output method itself unknown parameter
then out noise
method maximum entropy mean rather well problems like 1
see early development full mathematical treatment
below review what method about then apply obtain
section obtain section examine some its properties particular examine what results would if either noise level were small number measurements were large
section some simulations method compared bayesian maximum likelihood approaches
