introduction
paper study general rank problem } where
general rank problem practical interest many important machine learning problems matrix metric kernel learning above problem
general also approximate
recently most known methods were heuristic nature few known
most used heuristic problem assume resulting problem alternative
another common approach rank convex function
however most methods do not any
recently et al proposed online learning based methods
however their methods only at best approximation minimum rank
recent et al obtained first results rank
define constant number all rank at most } et al show constraints specifically finding minimum solution minimum rank solution
their results were later extended measurements up
however even best existing optimization algorithms relatively practice their results analyze
another recent work obtained using different approach
propose algorithm matching work show constraints constant their algorithm optimal solution
they also prove similar measurements provide convergence rate their algorithm
however their method not very efficient large datasets analyze
paper propose simple fast algorithm value based classical algorithm
present simple analysis minimum rank solution constraints even presence noise prove following
independent our work proposed algorithm similar our algorithm
however their analysis different
particular their analysis analysis they require assumptions than do
addition make matrix problem exact
our analysis recent work field
our results improve results et al follows
analyze than methods et al
further need assumptions only require required et al required required
strong convergence rate than using best optimization algorithms methods order
although property natural settings where constraints contain information about all unknown matrix several cases practical interest constraints only contain may not directly
one important problem where does not directly matrix problem
matrix problem given unknown matrix pairs goal complete
highly popular application matrix problem field where typically task predict given past
recently attention been given problem due
other applications matrix include data prediction social networks etc
similar matrix also general most methods heuristic nature no theoretical
least heuristic its perform best practice but analyze
recently et al obtained first results matrix under few additional assumptions
give when optimal solution see chosen at random where depends only
however algorithms above even when using methods specifically those et al practice not very noise
matrix special case our algorithm matrix
demonstrate significantly methods accuracy computational time noise
furthermore our experiments strongly suggest see similar those exact matrices almost optimal number
although do not provide applied matrix make direction give strong performance
prove though constraints problems do not property they property over matrices
condition along hypothesis matrix almost optimal number
also provide strong empirical evidence our hypothesis see } first present our algorithm section present its analysis constraints section
section our algorithm task matrix prove more property matrix problem
section give empirical results applied problems
