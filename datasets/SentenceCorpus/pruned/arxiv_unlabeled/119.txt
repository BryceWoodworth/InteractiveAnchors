following features paper
three popular component do not kernel order improve their classification
alternative framework called presented
new framework gains several over standard framework eg no mathematical no required kernel framework problems etc
while just assumptions previous related here
both kernel context distance learning
previous always apply methods kernel investigate two approaches construct appropriate kernel given
finally numerical results various datasets presented
introduction
recently many distance
recently proposed designed so they class problems where data one class form where classical component analysis analysis cannot
therefore new usually classical experiments reported recent
since learning distance learning linear learn one important all distance
research distance learning just recently several open 1 some efficient do not 2 kernel standard method not sense new mathematical derived new not existing algorithms theorem however our knowledge there no theorem context distance learning problem how efficient kernel function been previous best kernel via method
paper following key three popular recently proposed component analysis large order improve their classification respect algorithm
framework presented alternative choice framework
contrast kernel does not require derive new mathematical
also original available not required kernel version original
moreover new framework problems provides way up
two context distance learning
our both
moreover algorithms learning distance any space also algorithms reduction
problem efficient kernel selection
investigate kernel alignment method proposed previous see whether appropriate distance not
investigate simple method combination base
theoretical result provided support simple approach
kernel based our two approaches require much time when comparing standard approach
classifier there some about distance
provide experiments datasets prove
