introduction
large database learn predict who what any given one
standard approach task sample along corresponding where if only if person object image then sample learning algorithm
here total number database
when very large eg simple approach learning single predictor each become both at training testing time
our present work observation although output space may very high actual often sparse
each image only small number may present there may only small amount who what they
work consider how output space output learning output } but critical point output more common feature weight vectors rather than
general may sparse while actual outcome may not eg if there much may sparse probability one but may large support eg if there little between several
linear suggests must predict parameters order find value vector each
observation central area methods exist just measurements when sparse
basis our approach } show how apply algorithms output approach
at high level output approach form subset its
problems then uses their solution predict
role our application distinct its more uses data
although do matrix training data not data explicitly way
rather learn predict vectors then use sparse algorithms predictions
thus accuracy predictions over data distribution
main work application prediction problems output
efficient output method number required predictions only number making very problems
robustness form regret bounds general further detailed analysis linear prediction setting work } prediction problems domains multiple object recognition computer development general methods task
most approach reduction but too when number possible large especially if applied power set space
when structure space eg class efficient learning prediction methods often possible
here focus different type structure output not previous work
moreover our method general take advantage eg group when available
recently heuristics been proposed structure large output some degree
previously our work most related class output method prediction was first introduced shown useful experimentally
relative work approach prediction provide bounds regret error design
loss based approach suggests so loss
however does not provide significant choice method feedback between analyze here
output approach when used underlying problems being
where also shown using robust consistent predictor when reduced binary regression
compared method our approach same robustness up constant factor but requires training
our algorithms rely several methods where used
