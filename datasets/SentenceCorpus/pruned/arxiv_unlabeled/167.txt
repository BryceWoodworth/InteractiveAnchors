develop concept b c classification present
original t algorithm been very applications
binary classification
classification several data sets
introduction
classification basic task machine learning
training data set feature vectors samples class
here number classes
task predict class
study classification
many classification algorithms based one most significant machine learning
t algorithm especially applications practice
example method developed
used underlying learning algorithm based
method also used underlying learning procedure
study b c classification
present
based following two key classification popular loss functions classes usually assume only values classes needed
therefore choose base class derive algorithms only classes
at each step although base class not explicitly will training classes due
thus choose base class performance
idea loss function using base class may not at all
binary classification loss function considered so only need algorithm one instead class
classification loss function also
particular algorithm was derived explicitly over base classes
loss function our same
all three algorithms assume
however obtain different first second loss function
see section
terms our proposed original algorithm only few
since known algorithm much our work empirical
our experiment results available data sets will demonstrate could
also both training testing time may when small
data sets applications often large e g several samples
available data sets e g however small
our study data set large observations first review original algorithm functional
