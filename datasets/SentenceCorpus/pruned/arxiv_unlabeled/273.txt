selection features relevant prediction classification problem important problem many domains involving data
features prediction classification methods application
context information widely used criterion features sets features
at least three major information depend parameters there no criterion feature selection procedure estimation itself
shows how problems
two first ones using techniques provide statistical basis parameters search procedure
third one information criterion into measure how features not only problem at hand
introduction
data found many applications image signal processing biological data analysis many others
low cost other ways measure information increased lower cost many features idea being features only increase information at further analysis
problem data general more difficult
standard data analysis tools either when applied data provide results
related data usually under terms many usually having mathematical
simple like
many problems some features highly correlated
but if number features number measured data even simple linear model will lead problem more parameters than
other related more common situations when dimension data space high even if many data available learning
example data analysis tools use between data any distance i e most tools fact between two random close points between two random far ones tend same value average
data analysis tools must address two ways them
one develop tools able model data number effective parameters lower than dimension space
example into
other way some way dimension data space without significant loss information
two ways first one algorithms while second data themselves
two also exist reduce data features selected combined
feature combination means data either component analysis linear analysis etc
features i e some original features others less than particular case
however number when
indeed after selection resulting features among original ones allows data application
example features may help features further
original features may also help application data analysis results etc
another selection some when dimension data high between features known identified strongly
case indeed linear tools cannot while reduction widely used data its use quantitative data remains limited because lack standard method need use most existing tools computational cost some methods
feature selection based information between features
following follows
section problem feature selection main selection procedure
section information criterion related its estimation
section shows how solve particular how choose parameter information how search procedure how information concept using when dimension search space increases
