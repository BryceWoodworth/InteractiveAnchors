introduction
networks graphs provide useful mathematical representation variety complex systems world wide social biochemical systems
seen interest across study networks including both empirical studies particular systems development new techniques models their analysis
within mathematical researchers focused statistical network structure at times mechanisms simple structures
approach focused statistical network structure degree distributions correlation contrast example work networks social biological where focus instead properties individual groups
more recently researchers both become more global networks
one property networks little attention i e observation networks often structure together into groups then form groups groups so levels up level network
paper notion networks give model networks arbitrary structure
then describe approach learning models real network data based maximum likelihood methods markov sampling
addition global structure graph data our method allows graph structure information
at its our method sampling structures probability likelihood they produce input graph
allows us random graphs similar original graph through measure various average network properties manner bayesian model
particular search maximum likelihood model particular graph then used model further hypothesis testing derive structure models where features their likelihood extent occurs low probability
our knowledge method only one information about network
moreover information represented important features network will useful new about networks
