paper describe efficient algorithm proposed based value local optimization matrix problem
been shown if number revealed large output value good estimate original matrix so local optimization correct matrix high probability
present numerical results show algorithm low rank matrix very small subset its
further study robustness algorithm respect noise its performance actual datasets
introduction
paper consider problem low rank matrix small set observed
problem practical interest many applications
one example where small goal preference system
matrix since only few factors preferences
other examples matrix include problem structure motion data between also known problem
