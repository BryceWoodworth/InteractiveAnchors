% after classifier tools machine learning typically at hand able predict well data
thus answer question what most likely given data point
however most methods will provide no answer why model predicted particular single instance what features were most particular instance
only method able provide decision
paper procedure based set assumptions allows explain decisions any classification method
introduction
classification common data analysis
machine learning research methods useful data after being limited training set examples
most algorithms do not explain their decision
however practical data analysis essential obtain instance based i e would like gain understanding what input features made machine give its answer each individual data point
typically provided all training set example feature selection methods including find out good generalization
while give about global each input dimension still view does not provide answer instance basis
neural network literature also view was taken algorithms like input
only classification does provide individual decision
paper simple framework provides local vectors any classification method order help understanding prediction results single data
local features being relevant prediction at very points interest data space able local global view eg due effects
paper define local vectors class probability section give process classification
some methods output prediction without direct probability
propose section way estimate local
section will apply our learn properties vectors classifier applied data set
section will discuss how our approach applied classifier allows us explain how data set
section discuss more application where proposed prove useful drug human how existing lead order obtain new properties
models predictions help process choosing
our generated domain knowledge about functional groups question
section our approach related work section properties our approach before paper section
