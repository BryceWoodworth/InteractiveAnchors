introduction
probabilistic inference data often form finite sequence words over some
words assumed according fixed but unknown probability distribution over
probability distributions over free called stochastic
goal inference approximation distribution some class probabilistic models probabilistic
probabilistic structure finite parameters associated states represent probability state initial probability transition chosen
shown probabilistic same hidden markov models used statistical inference
given structure probabilistic sequence words parameters likelihood
practical cases however algorithms based e method used approximate values
other hand probabilistic structure parameters sequence words widely open field research
most results obtained so far only probabilistic i e probabilistic whose structure probabilistic i e probabilistic whose structure finite state
other stochastic particular cases power series probabilistic also particular cases been studied field theory
therefore stochastic generated special cases rational
call them rational stochastic
goal present paper provide study rational stochastic so out properties could useful inference
indeed objects special cases rational makes possible use theoretical tools been developed field hence give many questions when possible within time whether two probabilistic generate same stochastic
does negative probabilistic class generated stochastic
rational stochastic all its values always generated
so
also rational stochastic themselves considered objects theory out properties important inference example show notion so important inference natural stochastic used many properties classes stochastic
power series take their values let us set all power series
here only consider
any define set rational stochastic set stochastic over rational over
any two distinct corresponding sets rational stochastic distinct
show stochastic means any rational stochastic over its values also rational over
however not stochastic there exists rational stochastic over its values not rational over
any stochastic over any let us define respect stochastic
show rational stochastic over also rational over
any stochastic may used rational generated
but when positive i e may itself not generated
study properties two set rational stochastic over whose generated set rational stochastic over many
show any two classes any stochastic
its values

also show any there exists unique subset
then study representation rational stochastic means
first show set parameters generate stochastic not
moreover contains no subset generate whole set rational stochastic over
stochastic series two i any
show first since second one within time
show set stochastic generated probabilistic parameters


probabilistic called probabilistic if stochastic associated its states stochastic generated
show set stochastic generated probabilistic parameters


do not know whether class
however describe two when class reduced class
first one provides representation class but show problem
second one more representation but problem
finally show set stochastic generated probabilistic parameters
