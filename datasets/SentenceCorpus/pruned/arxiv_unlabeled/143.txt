introduction
learning object represented instance
i e feature vector associated class
let
instance space feature space set class
task learn function given data set
where instance known
although there many
problems do not framework well
particular each object
framework only one concept therefore corresponding instance
associated single class
however many objects
may multiple
example image
several classes eg
etc several if
different aspects eg novel
even
etc
specific real
task only one multiple

example image when image may
only concept instead other
associated image
difficulty here
those objects involve multiple
choose objects specific fundamental difficulty many tasks
contrast large all possible involved task may subset associated object at first then make choice small subset later
however subset class objects still task
alternative object single instance
many cases possible represent object using set
example multiple image where each
described instance thus image represented set
multiple where each section described
instance thus represented set multiple
where each described instance
thus represented set
using multiple
represent those objects may because some patterns
related some may become
paper propose learning
framework where example described multiple associated
multiple class
compared learning framework more
natural objects

representation new learning algorithms needed
propose
algorithm algorithm based simple strategy
experiments show problems involving objects multiple
under framework lead good performance

process may information also propose
i e direct algorithm
problems directly regularization framework
experiments show
algorithm algorithm
some practical tasks do not real objects themselves
real real instead given data where
each real object been represented single instance
thus cases
cannot more information real objects using representation
even situation however still useful
propose
i e instance algorithm into
examples learning
algorithm able achieve better performance than
learning directly some tasks
not because
object associated multiple class if described only single
instance information corresponding thus difficult
if into set some
ways information might some extent thus less
difficult learning
also learning objects
propose
i e discovery algorithm
target concept at first then data into
examples learning
algorithm able achieve better performance than
learning examples directly some tasks
also not
because corresponding concept may
difficult learn concept directly since many different
if into set corresponding some
relatively learning learn
at first then derive based them
less difficulty
