observation dynamic where secondary cognitive long they do not primary
achieve goal secondary must primary order identify data
main goal cognitive sense state different primary then over primary
specifically cognitive should make efficient decisions sense order obtain most available
several cognitive been proposed previous studies
example were each secondary two control control defined any available sense
other hand proposed optimization mechanism optimal algorithm well environment adaptive pattern estimation method
structure primary network here was also considered where optimal policy was characterized simple policy secondary was
authors however assumed primary statistics i e markov transition probabilities were available secondary
here our focus where cognitive must learn transition probabilities
work between two scenarios
first secondary sense all available primary before making decision one
secondary however does not process only one
model
propose efficient algorithm learning secondary between secondary pair
proposed does not assume control hence information same data
our numerical results demonstrate proposed over one where primary assumed sequence they upon
second both secondary sense only one primary each time
problem problem where optimal algorithm must between
finding optimal solution problem remains task
recent results efficient strategy similar learning phase one proposed
our numerical results show performance strategy known transition probabilities
