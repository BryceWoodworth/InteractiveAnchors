if information matrix at true distribution then been unknown what estimate about true distribution random samples
paper study regression problem prove limit theorem shows relation between regression problem two real threshold
obtained theorem important application statistics because us estimate generalization error training error without any knowledge true probability distribution
introduction
let natural numbers real
assume probability space random variable subject probability density function where probability density function constant function norm
function called regression function
assume set random variables subject same probability distribution
let subset
let function
error real function defined } where function probability density function constant called
note not constant but random variable because depends random variables
two random variables defined random variables called generalization training errors
since expected some natural conditions both when if there exists
paper how fast other words our study limit theorem shows when
if information matrix where positive arbitrary then problem well known regression problem
fact regression problem
however if if then problem called regression problem been unknown
general been difficult study limit theorem case when information matrix
however recently shown limit theorem based there mathematical between limit theorem two density estimation
paper prove new limit theorem regression problem us estimate random samples
limit theorem paper important application statistics because value generalization error estimated training error without any knowledge true probability distribution let
if function defined then set not one point information matrix at
functions used statistics information brain example neural networks basis functions functions
