while general learning under some relatively simple solutions exist
optimal decision problem one reward case one finite reward case derived make between reward uncertainty need
result two practical approximate algorithms experimentally
introduction
learning between actions expected according current world model improve world model potentially able achieve higher expected
been subject much interest before one being theory sequential sampling statistics developed
making sequential decisions one among set particular hypothesis view towards experiment hypothesis
more general sequential decision problems bayesian
optimal but bayesian solution problems was given while recently bounds sample complexity been found
approximation full bayesian case general learning problem given while alternative technique based actions estimated given
following section concept natural problem learning
after problem either identified
threshold problems
threshold found depend effective reward optimal policy our current belief distribution expected rewards each action
presented
section uses bound value derive practical algorithms then experimentally
