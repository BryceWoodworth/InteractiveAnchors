approach
learning algorithm
been extended variety ways others

recently novel approach approximation
problem was proposed et al

approach based stochastic
technique positive
certain matrix observation
probabilities used hidden markov
probability matrices
his used
recently developed matrix
algorithms those stochastic
techniques algorithm

were although
work did not stochastic techniques
algorithms both were developed after
methods based stochastic techniques including
one presented here different
based methods algorithms use input observation
sequence probabilities observation

approaches use system
methods while our algorithm


states
defined classes produce same

state probability
distribution over future observations
following
derive our result manner more
relation approaches

at level our algorithm follows
first
estimate matrix observation high order
statistics
matrix natural matrix

terms probability distribution future observations given
current state underlying markov
estimated
probability distributions used directly estimate
transition probabilities
estimated parameters used turn
matrix factors well underlying higher order
correlation matrix data generated estimated

present simple example exact
but does not any
fact
comparing factors
