investigate problem learning model distributed manner using c learned among them
propose simple method accuracy according task at hand
our approach therefore clusters
introduction
very large datasets common specific very large ones sites like sites like whole itself
models useful model but
even though there been some recent up inference models still remains fundamental open problem
