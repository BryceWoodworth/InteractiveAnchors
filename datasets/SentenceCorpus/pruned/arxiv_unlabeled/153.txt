introduction
how should measure amount information about phenomenon given us observation phenomenon
both information theory see information theory idea amount measured minimum number needed describe observation
but whereas theory description methods optimal relative some given probability distribution theory different any computer program first observation then description
amount information then defined size measured computer program then
similar given but case program after
thus long sequence } contains little information because program size about



would appear make amount information other object depend particular used
shown all choices lead amount information individual objects up constant
call object
while small complexity random complexity about their own length
complexity information terms program size out very idea applications theoretical computer probability theory statistics complexity was introduced different n g

during years subject developed into major area research
here give subject towards specifically information
recent work structure function all discuss here also found standard
section define complexity its most important properties
do much yet correct manner both all questions why not another one
section provides more discussed later
section well section inference less should over before into
