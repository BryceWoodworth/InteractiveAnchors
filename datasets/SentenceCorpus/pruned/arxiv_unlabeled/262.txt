describe approach domain adaptation appropriate case when one data do better than just using only data
our approach simple step approaches range datasets
moreover extended adaptation problem where one data variety different domains
introduction
task domain adaptation develop learning algorithms one domain
problem particularly because often situation large data one domain but model well second domain
approach present paper based idea domain adaptation learning problem into standard learning problem any standard algorithm may applied eg etc
our feature space both source target data use result input standard learning algorithm
there two domain adaptation problem been case case
case models following
large data source domain
addition little money small target domain
both datasets obtain model well target domain
case similar but instead having small target large but target
paper focus case
one particularly property our approach provides complete available at



addition our algorithm well some cases better than current state techniques
