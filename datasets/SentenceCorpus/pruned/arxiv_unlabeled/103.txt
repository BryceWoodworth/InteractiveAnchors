do optimal set
common assumptions analysis large set up either both
relevant one could not better some information
also discuss global behaviors optimal information general present between information
introduction
since end role
question behavior many individuals become central theory
order represent well possible evolution variables some mathematical functions been proposed become very literature
one most function
function particular interest since allows between different depends
another function was later
choice function describe process very strong at level many results found literature growth theory
but different functions one most recently one constant function et al
indeed function fixed
one percent increase one percent order constant level given structure relative
function allows between but fixed at number along across used process
main advantage function linear functions fact limit thus particular cases
one using functions one function often leads especially at point where models
work importance field statistical information his
et al nature their functions was best possible information observed
paper take information derive fundamental based two should always possible respect data etc might require standard assumptions etc rates scale etc
point our work class context convex
though they were four was only much later out other including statistics signal processing classification where they had become central
was even later was their makes possible them their
very functions same condition rely third assumption about existence particular total set
condition maximum likelihood condition makes most about data call low
paper our
first make clear respect information show some some limit cases some
without more assumptions set all yet show global shown all rates set general behaviors
fact our
our main show when various standard assumptions see above set all particular subset both sets
novel use popular very strong their existence
paper follows
section 2 their main properties
section common
section additional properties
