central result prediction universal probability 1 true sequence predictor if latter
hence universal sequence predictor case unknown
despite some results literature result convergence all random sequences open
convergence result would particularly natural since defined terms itself
show there universal do not all random sequences \ give negative answer open problem
also provide positive answer some
define measure mixture over all measures mixture over all
show all random sequences
distance two distributions central role
introduction
sequence prediction task defined predict next observed sequence
key concept general prediction problems less extent principle multiple
may theories consistent observations use theories predict
combined both his universal probability environments hence
represented mixture all
universal sense all
central result if probability at time given past observations function then universal predictor probability 1 p 1 predictor hence universal predictor case unknown distribution
convergence p 1 us close large almost all sequences
about whether convergence true any particular sequence measure
standard notion individual sequences
random sequence all effective tests eg \ large numbers etc
particular set all random sequences measure 1
natural whether difference all random sequences
result shows convergence may at most set sequences measure
convergence result random sequences would particularly natural context since defined terms itself
despite several solve problem open
paper construct random sequence show existence universal does not sequence hence open question some
remains open whether there exist other universal particularly additional structure properties convergence
main positive work
step consider measure defined mixture over all measures
show convergence predictor
distance two predictive distributions central role work
paper section give basic results numbers sets functions complexity define discuss universal
section results predictive convergence probability 1
both results derived bound expected
present bound expected very strong convergence rate
section investigate whether convergence all random sequences
construct random sequence some universal do not
give different
section present our main positive result
derive finite bound between sequence complexity
predictor
finally section show measure properties
section contains
