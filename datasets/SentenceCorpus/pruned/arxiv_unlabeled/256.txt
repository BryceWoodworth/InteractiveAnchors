present framework learning multiple related tasks
our framework form prior knowledge output spaces tasks
present learning results analyze conditions under learning possible
present results learning recognition system our framework consistent over methods
introduction
when two systems same data certain constraints between their
form prior knowledge
propose framework uses information significantly performance one systems
key idea perform only constraints
our example paper task recognition
consider hidden known structure below
further consider four potential sequences without actual sequence correct
seems because like should not part
seems because there also include } not part
because single should more than one two words
problems seems
fact hidden correct
paper problem prior knowledge into system
there between our proposed model both given section
present model our approach perform simple yet analysis section
analysis allows us define what good constraints
use example using hidden markov models show method relationship between theory
finally present results different data sets one comparing our method several section
see many data sets less than one required performance using sequence algorithm
