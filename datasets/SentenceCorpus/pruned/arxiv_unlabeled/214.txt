problems well markov decision processes
original approach here optimal policy based stochastic estimation
assume work possible learn optimal policy simulation using models
learned policy then used
order approximate stochastic context introduce new method approximate based approximation
general framework
introduction
years after years complexity many increased leading more more complex systems decision increasing amount data
number types along increased quality data far ability human often difficult compare how much information way given
results derive their environment
problem often problem
more simple situations context may lead like case
general problem could then effective use available database
many applications classical one being identify targets target change its way its way when under analysis several
questions then following at each how must group how long direction
increasing complexity targets identified makes even more difficult development optimal targets complex dynamic system
become very popular years many approaches found
authors use detection process propose during detection step
approach use set
point view markov decision process
underlying application problem choosing at each time action within set available actions
choice generally based density state vector environment system variables system itself
generally assumed state at least part state
moreover most applications only information state must estimated measurements
estimation process often derived within bayesian framework where use observation models } } where state noise measurements noise function
generally time functions
control problem finding policy i e given past possible
however control problem may solution generally practice
however few propose optimal solution like
several been out find like instance
learning also been used propose solution
propose paper policy within class policy learn means learn optimal value
our work approach described assume possible learn policy simulation using models overall system
optimal parameter been found used
work being detection targets show part paper how may applied
section described problem using approach
section derive algorithm learn parameter policy
section show how method may used
finally section simulations results
