introduction
discovery popular framework temporal patterns time series data applications several domains like biology detection etc
data framework single long events each temporal pattern called small nodes each associated called
order events should appear data order events
patterns total order their nodes called while those order called
task all whose frequency data threshold
algorithms exist literature data while no algorithms available case general
related work found context sequential patterns where data multiple sequences sequential pattern small
sequential pattern considered if there sequences data pattern occurs
contrast discovery patterns often single long events
makes computational task different sequential patterns
paper develop algorithms general order constraints over their nodes
our attention patterns called where cannot appear more than given
design efficient algorithms no
further our algorithms time constraints limit some maximum value
our algorithms either only only
moreover also method focus discovery process certain classes order what call property specific examples classes property
point out here one efficient discovery general there number any given size
because any order nodes there number also size all would occur at least often note problem does not eg discovery because cannot any
thus frequency measure general
propose new measure called evidence some notion entropy relative pairs events either order observed
procedure now requires threshold evidence addition frequency threshold
demonstrate utility our algorithms through empirical studies
paper follows
review define
finite state its associated properties
algorithms order described
described
our new measure
