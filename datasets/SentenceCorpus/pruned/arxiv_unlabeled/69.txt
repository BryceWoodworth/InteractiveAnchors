bounds risk play role statistical learning theory
they usually involve measure model studied dimension one its
classification exist models taking values
introduce appropriate case one models values
provides us new risk existing one
introduction
statistical learning theory three types pattern recognition regression estimation density estimation
however theory bounds been developed only
central theory notion classes functions
case binary measure dimension
also been proposed models models taking values set
no dimension was available so far taking their values
was all more many exhibit property support vector
paper introduced
generalization given numbers standard risk large models one dimension
latter dimension then above all proposed so far
provides us bound their sample complexity
paper follows
section basic bound risk large models
section defined
bound dimension then described section
lack space
they found
