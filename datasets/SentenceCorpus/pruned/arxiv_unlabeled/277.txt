introduction
given set points minimum contains all points
problem finding application data learning statistics computer computational
therefore efficient algorithms problem not only theoretical interest but also wide practical
exact algorithms finding typically
example algorithm time makes many practical case linear data may more
therefore there been significant interest finding approximation algorithms problem
state approximation algorithms problem use concept
given property if factor then resulting also contains
therefore finding approximation algorithm problem
approximation algorithms

at every current
if every point current solution then algorithm most point point current
best known algorithms family time
contrast present new algorithm derived problem finding convex but optimization problem
general framework our algorithm able achieve time where bound norm points
also approximation our algorithm given optimal our algorithm function whose value between
although two types approximation different simple section show our algorithm also approximation effort
our analysis related minimum convex problem present new algorithm
before given set points task here find given fixed points
our setting but not
present approximation algorithm where number
apply our algorithms two problems interest machine learning finding maximum distance
algorithm first problem was proposed while second one was studied
both cases our algorithms require number better computational complexity bounds
our paper section introduce review some results convex present general framework
section address problem section problem present our algorithms their analysis
discuss some applications our results machine learning problems section
paper then future section
found while experimental evaluation found
