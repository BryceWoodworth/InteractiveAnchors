other words small instead
case very important
now one obtain good data using very small
statistical inference using method use very close 1
another example might usually small
thus will total value future taking account effect interest
finally our another algorithm norm } distance }

because elements mechanism requires system
not always when large only need approximate answer
example may if
total number
new frequency data where using low memory
underlying technique based what call stable random
