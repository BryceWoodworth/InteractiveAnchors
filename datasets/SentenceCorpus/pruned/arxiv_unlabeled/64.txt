introduction
rule learning problems two
first part set called training set
each training set pair type
rule objects set set should objects training set pairs consistent
second part our common knowledge rule
one popular types considered paper
some cases two not both then problem training set
let us see what problem
sets given sets
assume more order
any given where problem finding function due following
let us set functions
then given our task every subset extended whole set because
actually every finite subset defined function both
see problem
above more problem finding subset function subset
so let us consider following generalization our problem will call consistent set } finite sets where each them defined function given
then every positive weight
our task find weight subset function i e 1 } set called function 2 } set weight some cases use mean weight set
paper will consider problem
