show optimal regret natural since over actions expected set probability distributions
use expression obtain lower bounds regret optimal strategy variety online learning problems
our method provides bounds without need construct learning lower bounds provide optimal strategies
introduction
within theory learning two particular significant over past statistical learning online learning
typically study generalization bounds convergence rates complexity measures function under assumption examples typically
manner some underlying distribution
under assumption statistical learning its statistics probability theory one argue main questions now relatively
online learning while having its early recently popular area research
one might argue assumptions lack make online learning
indeed often assumed observed data generated rather than being some fixed distribution
moreover contrast statistical learning sequential nature online problem change its strategy interaction
no learning seems more difficult than its statistical
case analysis does provide modeling learning scenarios network applications detection network etc interest area
upon review central results online found recent one cannot help but between performance online algorithms under stochastic assumptions
however
some important problems bounds learning theory only amount than bounds some stochastic strategies nature
paper between online learning statistical learning
using theorem show optimal regret algorithm online convex optimization difference between expected losses empirical loss under choice stochastic process data
leads lower bounds optimal regret exhibit several results statistical learning
online convex optimization game
at each predicts vector some convex set convex function loss at chosen point
order relationship stochastic setting choice choice
note instance
convex class functions set choices
his choices set
also define continuous loss function assume convex second
associated loss class
let set all probability distributions
sequence
distribution its distributions
online convex optimization interaction described follows convex optimization game } at each time step loss } objective out many online learning scenarios including prediction data sequential forecasting information see example
