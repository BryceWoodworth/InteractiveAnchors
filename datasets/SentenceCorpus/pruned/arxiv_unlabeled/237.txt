information distance similarity measure based used pattern recognition data clustering classification
notion information distance extended pairs finite
study information distance
use theoretical notion complexity practical length version involved using program
introduction
pattern recognition learning data one information objects information
involves objective information single object information one object another object pair objects information one object any other object multiple objects information between objects
classical notion complexity objective measure information single object information distance measures information between pair objects
notion research theoretical direction among others
research practical direction focused information distance similarity metric information distance manner complexity through information distance similarity measure had impact applications
distance been tested all time sequence used major data
method all other methods used data clustering detection
was shown method noise
theory found many applications pattern recognition clustering classification
objects represented computer applications range forecasting prediction literature
objects only represented objects like information distance uses information provided any search
words sense relative
applications questions systems
more either subject see
however many applications information between many objects instead just pair objects
example about about same most one most one
thus information distance measure pairs
