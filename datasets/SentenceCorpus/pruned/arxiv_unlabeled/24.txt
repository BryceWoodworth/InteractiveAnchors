introduction
consider general approach pattern classification elements each class first used probabilistic model via some learning method
resulting models each class then used instance chosen one associated model
example uses approach protein sequences via training probabilistic tree model et al each sequence class
indeed even where technique being used gain into process generated two more data sets still out associated classifier since rate provides quantitative measure accuracy estimated distributions
work further related algorithms learning classes probabilistic finite state objective learning been estimation true underlying distribution over output target distribution represented hypothesis
natural probability hypothesis would generate at random
one might better estimates class distributions better should associated classifier
paper make observation
give bounds risk associated classifier terms quality estimated distributions
results our interest relative distribution using variation distance defined next section
been shown how learn class using time set parameters expected length output
show how learn class respect variation distance bound independent length output
furthermore shown necessary criterion variation distance order achieve
show here leads still classifier
study problem learning probability distributions using via classes probabilistic
their criterion input distribution hypothesis should almost i e within close possible
study negative loss function context learning stochastic rules i e rules domain probability distribution over range
show here if two more class distributions sense then resulting stochastic rule distribution over given sense
show if instead class distributions well estimated using variation distance then associated classifier may not good negative likelihood risk but will rate close optimal
result general class classification where distributions may i e rate may positive
also variable one might positive cost more than negative show more general loss function still provided likelihood
result show more generally follows ability learn class distributions setting et al
study problem learning various classes probability distributions respect variation distance setting
respect than respect variation distance
furthermore usually used example due property when respect sample empirical likelihood sample
algorithm respect variation distance one respect technique when domain parameter learning problem
paper give related rule version learning problem where use variation distance
however distribution does not efficient representation requires probabilities used target limited
