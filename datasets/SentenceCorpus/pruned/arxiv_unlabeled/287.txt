methods previously been proposed problem finding associations data even items
while methods do not results they more efficient than approaches rely exact
however many similarity measures no methods been known
paper show how wide variety measures simple sampling method
method also find rules
demonstrate our method exact methods when threshold above average average support not too low
our method particularly good when contain many items
experiments standard significant real data sets much larger than theoretical
time over order significant space observed
introduction
central task data finding associations binary relation
typically where there sequence now each set items
goal find patterns who more likely also
there no way whether indeed seems depend factors not
result number measures paper some most common measures including
addition rules related similarity measure
general similarity measures
limit problem binary associations i e patterns involving pairs items
there large literature finding patterns involving larger sets taking into account time rules etc
while some our results extended larger sets will binary case
previous methods rely one following pairs particular means number each pair each similarity every pair items estimated comparing
our approach different both approaches generally performance
some sense directly result set pairs items similarity measure above some threshold
our method based means output may contain there may
however errors reduced any level at some cost our experimental results negative probability less than
method sampling main paper different previous approaches involve sampling
main focus many previous been space number over data set since been main
time also consider time
items contains pairs if not small effort all pairs compared cost set
true particular if data able data at rate more than per second
one been used reduce space but also time require high support i e define most items simply because they do not occur they below support
however observed means potentially useful associations e g between genes not reported
paper consider problem finding associations support
support still used reduce size data set before our algorithms applied
following first discuss need time data then relationship between our related
