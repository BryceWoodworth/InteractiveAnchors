our model follows common practice literature making assumptions about complete knowledge strategy do not require
model bound between algorithm online learning theory best fixed
show strategy robust lack information about knowledge
introduction
many information information
typically many more than
instead every typically perform analysis identify address but what effective strategy
approach risk might future
often consider
sufficient conditions when effective
study strategies model
previously proposed models see section do not assume according fixed probability distribution
instead consider model who strategy
standard literature make assumptions about
example complete knowledge strategy do not require
further make assumptions about knowledge do not assume all system
however do assume past actions example via detection system
our model find two properties sufficient strategy perform well best strategies
first no single number
consistent situations where numbers but not
second without
example rules database at relatively low
because our model many into single graph view increasing instead e g single
making assumption choose not study interaction
instead model at more level appropriate
example might his find particular application require use during
make assumption dependent
assumption does not interaction would better represented step function step at cost
instead assumption where step functions into
evaluate strategy been proposed previously
metric focus who reduce
do not between
instead compare payoff his cost
will alternatives different
our main result show sufficient conditions strategy best fixed sense between at most all provided game many at least
prove our techniques online learning literature
techniques case where does not know all game matrix us analyze situations where does not know all
although our main results model single our results model based multiple
our results also robust fixed number times
although most likely strategy find some situations strategy effective optimal fixed
fact find natural strategy effective
strategy both than does not less than strategy because does not do not actually occur
