problem matrix sampling its much attention recently
problem matrix problem main objective design efficient algorithm matrix only small number its
although task general recently shown under assumption rank matrix using after one its
paper propose alternative approach much more efficient larger class matrices significantly smaller number
specifically first introduce class stable matrices show all those assumption
then propose basis algorithm show stable rank matrix after its
our sampling bound only factor limit optimal
moreover algorithm very algorithm
more our algorithm will provide exact input matrix time
contrast algorithm only provide approximate one time
introduction
fundamental problem many matrix certain properties some information
typically problem global structure small number local observations
instance consider following estimation } statistics machine learning often interest find maximum likelihood estimate matrix random vector
estimate used study relationship among variables give some performance certain systems
usually information available estimation
instance may number independent samples according distribution well some structural constraints e g certain values matrix structure some its values etc
thus estimation problem matrix so structural constraints certain likelihood function } see given points distance between any two points
however problem given subset find points called where fixed those out but see eg
problem many different network see eg molecular see e
g problem matrix distance matrix certain rank structure motion } fundamental problem computer structure object its motion over time
problem known structure motion problem literature finding approximation certain matrix see eg
however due presence matrix often
when one into account problem matrix one certain rank see eg systems } although task predicting preferences
problem various systems been developed over years see eg
those systems matrix preferences where items
when subset items preferences those items those preferences will then corresponding matrix
if not considered particular then corresponding matrix will
now order predict preferences items one will complete matrix so certain performance measure each utility
note all examples above take information given us
particular cannot instance unknown matrix examine
result problem e g there may not unique even any solution given
indeed important issue
however not address paper see eg related work
instead take different approach consider aspects problem
specifically let rank matrix
known
no information about other than its rank available
however any many order complete
if all then will able
thus natural whether only small number still able efficient manner
being theoretical problem does practical applications
instance network setting problem needed order network
out if number required small then will able network just few distance measurements small program
idea what should aim let us first determine available rank matrix
will give us lower bound number need order exact
towards end consider value where matrix
there
now must all previous must length
thus there there
same there
hence
