consider classification when part available data
data useful classification problem when make assumption behavior regression function distribution
proposed assumption one
propose mathematical assumption method based density level sets estimation advantage achieve fast rates convergence both number examples number examples
introduction
classification been interest over past few years many methods been proposed
methods give answer improve classification accuracy using data together data

data used different ways depending assumptions model
there two types assumptions
first one set potential them
case data used measure between complexity resulting classifier see eg
second approach one use here
data contains clusters observations used identify clusters
assumption
idea practice several ways various methods
one presented estimate clusters then each
most methods use clusters components density level sets
however they use usually mixture model estimate underlying density far
moreover no generalization error bounds available methods
same propose methods learn distance using data order smaller than
whole family methods also at using data learn between points
graphs between points
detailed graph methods
finally kernel methods where data used kernel
kernel measures between points methods also learning distance using data see
assumption another way i e decision low density regions
been widely used learning since used design standard algorithms related kernel methods above
algorithms greater given decision
more see eg
although most methods make assumption no probabilistic terms been provided so far
propose paper remains very close its original allows derive generalization error bounds
also discuss what cannot using data
one whole too need smaller part classification over standard classification
paper
after model assumption discuss why how improve classification performance next section
section study population case when density known idea our target
indeed population case some way case when amount data
section contains main propose algorithm derive rates convergence measure performance
consistent density level set given section
section choice possible
results section

paper positive
set
two sequences paper will if there exists constant if some
thus if any
