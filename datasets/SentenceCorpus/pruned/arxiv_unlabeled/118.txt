introduction
regularization norm interest recent years machine learning statistics signal processing
context linear regression problem usually
much early effort been algorithms solve optimization problem
particular algorithm allows find regularization i e set solutions all values regularization parameters at cost single matrix
moreover regularization norm leads sparse solutions i e vectors many thus model selection
recent at model consistency i e if know data were generated sparse vector does actually when number observed data points
case fixed number does pattern if only if certain simple condition matrices
particular low correlation settings indeed consistent
however presence strong cannot consistent potential problems variable selection
adaptive where weights norm then allow consistency all situations
paper first derive detailed analysis pattern selection estimation procedure previous analysis specific regularization parameter
show when where number observations then will all variables should model relevant variables probability one fast while all other variables variables positive probability
if several datasets generated same distribution were available then latter property would suggest consider estimates each all relevant variables would always selected all datasets while variables would models many different datasets would simply them
however practice only one but methods several datasets same unique
paper show when using actually consistent model estimate without consistency condition required
new procedure b s s
finally our framework could seen applied however our procedure may rather considered combination subset variables all terms variable selection our case consistent also allows potential additional
paper present analysis model selection describe algorithm well its model consistency while our results data where true sparse model known data machine learning
