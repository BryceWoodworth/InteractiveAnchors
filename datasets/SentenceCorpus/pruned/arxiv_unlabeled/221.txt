introduction
consider problem inference \ data particular unknown distribution data
case continuous domain means probability density data
without structural assumption since finite amount data sufficient density model space model class
estimation one family
family characterized mean
maximum likelihood estimate distribution data likelihood
maximum likelihood if family too large especially if
complex distributions prior order probability
model likelihood times prior
full bayesian procedure complete inference
typically like mean reported } choose prior } finite small spaces prior often
case one typically model classes increasing dimension
dimension often well due factor phenomenon case true model complex model classes since they contain models
full bayesian treatment one would prior probability e g \ dimension over dimension
model domain into assume constant distribution within each take frequency estimate probability each bayesian inference
there heuristics number function data size
model very
distributions its one dimension at most low more generally fixed heuristic choice number
present full bayesian solution problems problem
our model
there alternative bayesian models some all
examples % continuous process % % bayesian field theory % % bayesian % bayesian kernel density estimation % other mixture models universal % but exact solutions
% markov sampling % maximization algorithms % methods % efficient % kernel density estimation % often used obtain approximate numerical solutions but time global convergence critical
there also density see general density tree estimation particular
idea model class discussed paper very some e g \ probability either domain two prior each part i e \ each part either
many constant function many any distribution
while prior over about versus will see if only if data
method full bayesian tree approach adaptive present very simple fast algorithm all interest
note not our model better practice than more models above
main feature our model allows fast exact solution
likely use complex problems where time bayesian integration major
any case tree model attention also our model should

also discuss some example domains like classification tasks
