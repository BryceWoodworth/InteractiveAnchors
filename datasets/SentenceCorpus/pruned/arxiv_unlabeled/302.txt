our lower bound techniques online learning classical sets theorem
also consider version problem problem show problem similar
give matching lower bounds regret problem metric
bounds form where depends metric space
introduce novel notion problem
finally show both problems become sense no algorithm regret if only if metric space
introduction
problems been studied more than years setting common sequential decision making
stochastic problem algorithm must choose fixed set strategies each time random payoff whose distribution depends strategy selected
performance algorithms terms regret difference expected payoff between choices always one fixed strategy
addition their many applications range experimental design online another feature algorithms they efficient terms growth rate problems algorithms whose regret at time scales been known more than two work extended work
many applications problems especially computer applications online adaptive require strategy sets very large even
strategy sets bound does not apply while very large finite sets large constant
indeed without making any assumptions about strategies their payoffs problems large strategy sets allow no solutions any algorithm some random
study problems strategy set large but one given information form payoffs
problems become subject study recent years eg
problem version stochastic problem information bounds difference expected payoff between certain pairs strategies
models situations where decision some similarity information about strategies similar strategies obtain similar payoffs
similarity information may metric space structure strategy set constraints expected payoff function function constant metric space
% constant
problem was introduced et al
work studied problem few specific metric real
prior work considered regret function time focused metric space
various lower bounds form were where depends metric space
particular if metric space standard metric then there exists algorithm regret bound up factors
more generally arbitrary metric space one define there exists algorithm regret up factors if see
following
although algorithms regret known most metric existing work provides no examples metric algorithms regret bound although bound all finite
fact most metric been studied known lower bounds form where therefore natural regret best possible metric space
there metric one achieve regret
there any metric space best possible regret between
% any metric space } make above issue more let us following
questions above following
regret bound best possible even problems lower bound
thus our bound problems metric best possible bound between
furthermore show metric turn our attention version problem
any problem there exists corresponding problem after each payoffs all strategies revealed
settings been studied online learning literature under best problems
particular finite set strategies one achieve constant regret when payoffs
over time
addition full feedback one could also consider version payoffs revealed some but not all strategies
specifically define feedback where each algorithm two payoff
after payoffs revealed both strategies
will setting special case setting
version problem called problem defined problem instance where metric space probability measure set payoff functions expected payoff function function
each algorithm presented
sample
metric structure known algorithm measure not
show problem similar one theorem
bound feedback lower bound full feedback thus issue what means algorithm feedback many strategies
between metric problem very those
let us consider end metric problem
obtain problem if only if metric space not
moreover our bound setting whereas lower bound full feedback
consider
view lower bound matching bounds
et al observed bounds every metric space finite problem their algorithm version therefore natural whether there exist metric optimal regret problem between
question matching lower bounds terms novel notion problem
lower bound theorem version problem instance further property each function itself function
term version full feedback
fact version obtain matching bound end consider metric space all probability distributions under distance
introduce novel notion better complexity regret algorithm allows very analysis } any metric space there exist parameters any not any
depending metric space take any value
