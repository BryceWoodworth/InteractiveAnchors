introduction
let distributed random variables
problem statistical learning design accurate predictor output variable input variable basis number independent training samples their distribution very little no prior knowledge distribution
present paper performance learning when learning agent only description training samples
problem learning under communication constraints variety distributed estimation using network adaptive control games
other scenarios often case agents who training data agents who use data make decisions communication between two types agents possible only over
hence there between communication rate quality inference interest
paper follows our work bounds performance statistical learning under two communication training sequence learning agent over b input part training sequence available learning agent arbitrary while output part before over
whereas at where description training data was obtained through vector structure between learning here
show under certain conditions there no training sequence setting
due fact estimate underlying distribution metric specifically learning problem at hand then description learning agent who then find predictor estimated distribution
setting b however because no input part training sample cannot estimate underlying distribution
instead description output part using specific vector one designed expected distance between underlying distribution may empirical distribution output pairs
our result setting b uses generalization recent work communication probability distributions
problem learning pattern classifier under rate constraints was also recent paper
they assumed underlying probability distribution known rate memory learning then problem design best possible classifier without any constraints its structure
work models learning
approach present paper
consider more general learning regression well classification but allow only prior knowledge underlying distribution assume class available
thus while bounds performance any classifier including ones model data here performance learning must perform well presence uncertainty about underlying distribution
novel our approach both used design learning algorithm conditions must learning possible involve between available prior knowledge about underlying distribution set available learning agent
future work lower bounds our specific classes used statistical learning theory
