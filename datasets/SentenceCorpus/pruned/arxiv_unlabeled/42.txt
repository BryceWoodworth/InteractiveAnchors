recent machine learning make possible design efficient prediction algorithms data sets numbers parameters
paper new technique predictions output many algorithms including support vector kernel regression kernel many other methods
predictions new objects include quantitative measures their own accuracy
measures under assumption machine objects their assumed generated same probability distribution
particular possible control up statistical number predictions confidence level
validity being goal prediction taking full account new features other available information produce accurate predictions possible
using machine learning
introduction
two main problem prediction classification regression standard subjects statistics machine learning
classical classification regression techniques data however apply techniques data sets computational
several new techniques first all support vector other kernel methods been developed machine learning recently goal data sets large numbers objects
new techniques lack useful measures confidence their predictions
example some bounds popular theory probability error even relatively data sets p
paper efficient way predictions produced new methods i e them measures their accuracy
chosen not only measures but they also take full account special features object predicted
call our algorithms predictions they introduced section
their most important property validity under assumption discussed
validity means accuracy their predictions
property terms finite data sequences without any
validity depends assumption many other algorithms machine learning call assumption objects their assumed generated same probability distribution
strong assumption machine learning rely other assumptions assumption see eg any stochastic assumptions see eg
however much than statistical model prior distribution parameter space statistical theory prediction
taking into account under assumption does not appear
so know
not so
will various measures their
only need about when specific problems
any classification regression algorithm into predictor so most methods machine learning design efficient
main part paper section description predictor based theory
best possible predictions but
however set task universal predictor well possible
section introduce notion state simple result about their validity
section also describe results computer experiments prediction
section consider example how our model stochastic mechanism data within framework assumption
if model actual stochastic mechanism construct optimal predictor out almost good confidence predictor will given later
when stochastic mechanism significantly model predictions but their
predictor very results good when model correct
section describe setting problem prediction section contrast more standard setting
notion validity introduced section both settings but setting now prove predictions will close high probability chosen confidence level
setting property validity remains empirical fact
section also discuss setting introduce new settings between
large degree still property validity settings
section difference between two inference empirical data
but them elements lead significant their computational section
show how some popular methods machine learning used underlying algorithms prediction
do not give full description methods existing
paper however sense explain all features underlying algorithms used their predictions
information provide will apply our techniques their methods
