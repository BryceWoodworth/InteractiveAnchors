method stable random using low memory where parameter
method statistical estimation task various been proposed based mean mean power etc
study optimal whose main less than taking power main previous
our experiments report optimal one order more efficient than previous
learning tasks should
addition its computational optimal theoretical properties
more accurate than previous when }
derive its theoretical error bounds i e no hidden sample complexity bound
introduction
method stable random efficient data provides mechanism some machine learning
paper provide algorithm stable random both accurate efficient
