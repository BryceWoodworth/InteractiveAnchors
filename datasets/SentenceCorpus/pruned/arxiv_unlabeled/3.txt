introduction
paper address problem distributed learning under communication constraints distributed signal processing networks data distributed
designed make environments they however they typically characterized constraints energy limit ability data each other
data distributed multiple agents e g make optimal however may them information
methods studied within machine learning demonstrated empirical many i e communication signal processing applications
thus both applications natural question power machine learning methods inference distributed learning under communication constraints
paper address question general model distributed learning then distributed algorithm training kernel regression
algorithm algorithms thus into statistical behavior algorithms standard analyses mathematical
