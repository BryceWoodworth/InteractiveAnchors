understanding clusters importance since they been shown source evolutionary been multiple including variety
previously developed algorithm evolutionary gene clusters using only human genomic sequence data
paper propose probabilistic model evolution gene clusters algorithm genomic sequences multiple species
several obtain high quality clusters multiple species our method will useful new data sets
introduction
about human genome
when multiple occur at particular genomic they give complex gene clusters
many important gene various including disease clusters
gene often functional indeed genes been shown positive selection
paper describe probabilistic model evolution gene clusters sampling algorithm inference highly sequences
demonstrate our approach apply our algorithm sequences well real clusters available sequencing data
previously studied gene family only possible events
they also assume genes always whole
demonstrated more complex models needed address evolution gene clusters human genome
more recent work genes been algorithms
local alignment program e g only above certain threshold e g
sequences between considered
due sequence similarity between set into classes types
thus sequence into sequence
task history find sequence evolutionary events e g sequence no type occurs sequences species
history also directly individual types call
species tree information used sequences at points see eg
common way at most recent events time
context sequences events sequence
solutions problems small number events given sequence single species
particular they necessary condition identify no
after same step identify second etc
showed following any sequence leads history same number events under assumption
result there may number most solutions problem may unique history
similar problem also been recently context much larger sequences whole genomes set including etc
their algorithm every species tree
authors give algorithm history correct
both methods make use heuristics their assumptions allow their algorithms applied real data
assumption often long sequences same used
however there evidence do not occur sequence
moreover close each other may lead short identified sequence similarity algorithms into types
example our data section than may appear additional instead
thus useful but cannot application real data sets
also examined assumption sequences individual
than all our simulations were even long } paper present simple probabilistic model sequence evolution design sampling algorithm explicitly uncertainty estimation allows
results suggest model there may still many solutions similar likelihood
stochastic sampling approach allows us examine multiple solutions same framework particular interest e g expected number events individual local properties sequences
addition using data multiple species our approach additional information about
our problem related problem gene their species
recent algorithms gene tree e g also consider genomic context individual genes
however our algorithms not only use context additional information but derived evolutionary also explain how genomic context individual genes
our current approach uses simple model rates between individual
however future work will possible more complex models sequence evolution variable rate site models models evolution within same framework
will allow us identify sites under selection gene clusters way towards better functional important genomic regions }
