introduction
research systems during years produced new
now widely observed generated systems exhibit
when what stochastic process one now whether not process instead hidden but system
though requires new way at random data since dynamics very process both out
dynamics one tools systems theory its most basic form issue view continuous dynamics sense any measures system representation underlying behavior
model time series data system two must
first must consider representation true dynamics provides
second must consider inference models based data
relation between more than one might
will demonstrate one hand data should designed entropy rate resulting data
allows one much information each possible
other hand model inference entropy rate over class alternative models
search structure data
here address between optimal optimal models relatively simple system
consider design noise
then use bayesian inference order markov model resulting data
our model system noise } where random variable mean
consider design limit
most previous work dynamics provides reference
dynamics representation system follows
assume time consider state space itself
space into finite set regions many ways
most called markov must two conditions
first image each region must
second must
if markov cannot found system under next best called
one often found using its critical points
critical points used state space into over
note markov but not generally true
given any then series states its representation
latter simply associated sequence
unique each when
central result dynamics using long sequences observed identify smaller smaller regions state space
system region associated sequence
limit sequences result representation representation will show often much analyze
way chosen sequence continuous dynamics sequence
choice then our problem
noise limit entropy rate resulting sequence
do consider length words
entropy length sequences obtained then } where probability
entropy entropy rate estimated following limit } practice often more accurate length estimate entropy rate using } another key result dynamics entropy original continuous system found using
particular true entropy rate estimated entropy } thus into about experiment design results us design so observed entropy rate
fact each produce most information possible
useful useful only case when know us value positive
there single estimated observed using } taken results us how design our effective observation
presence noise no exist
however demonstrated methods developed above robust presence noise
any case view output stochastic process
sample length measurements taken finite basis our inference
our here sample generated sequences states
means particular stochastic process
assume addition binary
