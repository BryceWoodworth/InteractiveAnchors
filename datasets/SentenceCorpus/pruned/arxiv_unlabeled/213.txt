introduction
all data techniques detection information data
behavior certain objects
detection techniques widely been applied e g reactions analysis e g financial detection e g information e g detection so
recent many detection approaches been proposed into several e g e g e g methods
however methods often applications due number
data usually distribution where objects distributed domain feature space
point view objects cannot represent patterns e g clusters normal data
however point view objects several represent pattern subset objects
only objects do not any other object groups
existing depend assumption most objects few main clusters
they datasets because high rate low
difficult current detection approaches set accurate parameters datasets
most algorithms must through
because data usually do not contain objects
addition evaluate detection performance without domain
therefore detection result will if parameters not chosen
parameter setting problem researchers proposed detection methods
instead binary methods provide objects represent degree each object
domain selected where typically far smaller than objects real
since detection procedure provide good interaction between data detection methods become popular applications
distance detection approach
order original detection method distance paper
distance object its short object
larger higher object objects values
local factor was proposed same
factor each object t its
factor depends how data object its
since uses threshold normal objects same problem parameter setting
lower threshold will produce high rate while high threshold value will result
recent applications researchers found more use manner i e \ only objects values will considered
call
researchers proposed other methods data
although existing detection techniques difficulty parameter setting detection methods paper take examples low data
section will discuss further problems
paper propose new detection local factor datasets
uses relative distance object its measure how much objects their
higher degree object more likely object
addition properties including its lower bound probability provide choosing size
order parameter setting applications technique our approach
perform various experiments both datasets compare our detection performance
experimental results our proposed significant detection datasets
paper section discuss problems data

section detection algorithm described together analysis its complexity
experiments reported section show our method previous approaches at least considered datasets
