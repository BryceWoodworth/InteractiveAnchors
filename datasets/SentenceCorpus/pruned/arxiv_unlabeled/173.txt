paper game problem data clustering then develop clustering algorithm data points considered who make decisions strategies games
after each game each expected payoff
later uses function change his them order his payoff
further algorithms discussed two cases strategies two payoff two functions
simulation results demonstrated data points datasets clustering algorithms fast rates convergence

introduction
field
more recently increasing number researchers different computer information theory involved properties
during series significant had been made
one was world algorithm while classical world classical algorithm time
three years later computer could search database time
et al combined algorithms propose algorithm
recent years many focus game theory work been
instance d studied game world
his result showed if was strategies would always his who classical strategies increase his expected payoff well et al demonstrated could when both strategies p
et al result i e result game would towards result while other used classical strategies et al investigated game domain
their result showed there unique game when strategies were c
et al reported game more efficient than classical game they found bound
some experiments about games also been different
more about games see
algorithms make us out solutions better than best known classical certain types problems
furthermore more important they new way find potentially
therefore may construct classical algorithms present new algorithms solve problems pattern recognition better computer
following idea some researchers proposed their novel methods demonstrated results
addition data clustering main pattern recognition widely used many pattern analysis data information image
however there usually little knowledge available about data
response clustering into being particularly among data points
data clustering study algorithms methods data points
other words its task find structure given data points group them into clusters
paper game problem data clustering order novel clustering algorithm based games
our algorithms data points who make decisions games
network each use strategies game against every one his
later function small payoffs new higher payoffs at same time
furthermore between his different one another
during games structure network between tend stability
finally if each only network will into several each
