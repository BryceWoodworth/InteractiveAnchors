convex problem number training samples
introduce efficient support vector regression based belief algorithm
paper demonstrate methods complex system domain could efficient distributed
compare proposed algorithm previously proposed distributed
our comparison shows proposed algorithm just accurate while being significantly especially large datasets
demonstrate proposed algorithm up nodes data points using gene
far know our work belief algorithm large scale distributed systems
introduction
class algorithms recent years performance compared other pattern classification algorithms
there several problem depending specific application e g classification regression etc
one using requires problem whose size number training examples
fact research efficient
recently several researchers suggested using multiple nodes order increase computational power available
article introduce distributed based belief algorithm
improve original algorithm communication represented number each optimization where number data points
previously was known algorithm very efficient sparse matrices
using our novel demonstrate algorithm very good performance matrices well
also show algorithm used thus making algorithm more than what was considered previously thought possible
using simulation demonstrate our existing
using up gene solve very large data sets up data point using up
our comparison shows proposed algorithm just accurate previous while being significantly
