method presented may also other games may even other domains where sequences actions
introduction
other popular games different
example some more other more difference will affect their choice any given position more generally their overall
problem paper machine learning computer between based their
before explain our review method temporal difference learning central our approach
temporal difference learning machine learning technique work learning occurs differences between predictions actual outcomes temporal sequence observations
used game study computer learning experience
although program did not achieve was program was first computer program against human world see detailed but less description machine learning program demonstrated power technique temporal difference learning combined using neural network program learn play at level through
following approach there been similar technique games
time so natural make use existing game strong evaluation function however temporal difference training did not
learning game also been used game patterns prediction using methods other than temporal difference learning
here our aim not computer game but rather play particular learning games principle system could learn but when sufficient game exist learning generally more important note information available during learning should not include any when game was variation result game
all learning sequence each game
at different perspective view problem one classification
assume computer play two
problem then game between computer some confidence was
at even higher level problem test where computer may human human
some sense may true available computer humans their due increased power
moreover there seems high correlation between choices made human world class see
will not discuss test further now will classification problem within domain
far know new problem paper suggest using temporal difference learning
all previous uses temporal difference learning games some above learn weights evaluation function order improve play computer program
our still learn weights evaluation function but objective given rather than improve play
if under very strong example then resulting program likely but method could also used learn evaluation functions
learning algorithm described section based rule only current predictions
note more general proposed factor between 1 algorithm also take into account predictions
training both adaptive learning rate term describe
section present concept where learn two recent world make use feature weights game between two who was who was
despite some results there also some fundamental our approach
particular out us our choice features described too since all strong their combination according
higher level more more
however difficult manner moreover not clear how them into framework
discuss other
section give our
