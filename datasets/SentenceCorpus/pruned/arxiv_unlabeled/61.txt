problem universal source modeling context was recently
sources
results sources show metric measures any family sources conditions universal source identification
also give several examples sources conditions
introduction
universal source one all sources within given class
suggests good universal should probabilistic model source long data sequence based model
been made data via 1 estimate source parameters 2 data model
where length dimension parameter space
recently extended
sources parameter spaces
shown under appropriate conditions there exist universal source identification whose source estimation both length
each parameters estimated
moreover constant hidden increases model class measured dimension certain class decision regions source
main results
assumption relevant model classes sources markov hidden markov processes
furthermore assumption parameter space may not always
paper both assumptions
because parameter space not use whose performance
show under certain conditions there universal source modeling length both relative best at each length source estimation at where dimension certain class decision regions all source process distributions
key novel feature our most existing universal rely identification active source probabilistic model
moreover our results show underlying model class dimension sequence
model class learn turn performance because use source parameters learned past data how current
may prove useful settings adaptive control under communication constraints where between quality parameter estimation performance central importance
