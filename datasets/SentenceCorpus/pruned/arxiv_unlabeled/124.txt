% propose framework comparing distributions us design statistical tests determine if two samples different distributions
our test difference over functions kernel space
present two tests based large bounds test while third based distribution
test time although efficient linear time available
several classical distributions when function space used difference more general eg space
apply our tests variety problems including matching using method where they perform strongly
performance also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs first tests
introduction
address problem comparing samples two probability distributions statistical tests hypothesis distributions different called problem
tests application variety
interest compare data types measured different whether data may whether differences experimental procedure differences data distributions
interest between data different types either determine whether two cancer may perspective differences
database matching multiple where not known similarity distributions their
test whether distributions different basis samples each them finding well e g \ function large points small negative possible points
use our test difference between mean function values two when large samples likely different distributions
call maximum mean
quality depends class functions define
one hand must so population if only if
other hand test consistent empirical estimate its sample size increases
use universal kernel our function classes since will shown both properties also review classical distributions based different function classes
more practical note computational cost when compared other given points cost time
also propose less efficient algorithm computational cost performance at given computational cost at larger data
define three statistical tests based
first two use convergence bounds provide finite sample test performance at being differences between
third test based distribution practice more differences distribution at small sample
present work results who turn work
note latter only third test approach more accurate approximation distribution test
our section population if only if when universal
also review alternative function classes metric probability distributions
section give hypothesis testing problem review other approaches problem
present our first two hypothesis tests section based two different bounds between population empirical
take different approach section where use distribution empirical estimate basis third test
when large data available cost sample size may therefore propose section version linear cost number samples associated test
section provide methods related statistics machine learning literature
finally section demonstrate performance tests problems matching using method
our approach well high data low sample addition able distributions graph data first proposed test
