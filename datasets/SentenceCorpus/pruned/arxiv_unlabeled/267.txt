introduction
recent years cognitive been focus significant research
propose improve making use large frequency remains
cognitive goal primary primary called secondary cognitive
secondary must primary presence their own transmission identify available primary network
thus potential significantly increasing networks
paper focus communication model previously considered single secondary primary
at each time either way
secondary only sense his main task choose sense at each time its expected transmission
under model may task particular class observed markov decision process also called
assumed statistical information about primary available secondary
practice however statistical characteristics e transition probabilities each not fixed must estimated secondary
secondary sense not simple parameter estimation problem but task learning
consider scenarios secondary first out phase statistical information model then follows phase where optimal policy based estimated parameters applied
key issue between
issue been considered before who proposed rule set length phase but without evaluation performance approach
et al also considered problem multiple secondary case but model where each independent distributed source
field learning class problems known learning several approaches been proposed recently
however directly model state only observed
our strategy algorithm setting length phase
under strategy length phase not fixed phase statistical evidence determine optimal policy
feature approach strong performance form regret bounds
strategy described general framework
model specific example transition probabilities each
approach assumption each possible parameter value solution problem known not at large but well case model
provide detailed account use approach two simple model including case considered
article follows
model described section
section algorithm presented its performance terms regret bounds obtained
application detailed section both one model case
