analyze two algorithms minimum distance estimate
estimate requires than minimum distance estimate but than latter
focus computational density estimation
present two algorithms both same minimum distance estimate
first one minimum distance estimate uses same number
second one called minimum uses only linear number
also give examples algorithms cannot explore algorithms density estimation
introduction
study following density estimation problem considered
there unknown distribution given not independent samples define empirical distribution
given finite class distributions our objective output error
use norm well many useful properties example scale fact approximate identification distribution norm estimate probability every event
following two parameters influence error possible distance empirical error
first parameter required since no control over hence cannot distribution better than distribution one norm
not how define second error respect
see section
analyze two algorithms minimum distance estimate
minimum distance estimate defined special case minimum distance principle
minimum distance estimate example was used obtain estimates factor kernel density estimates also hypothesis testing
algorithm requires than minimum distance estimate but terms two parameters above than latter
our main two estimate both same minimum distance estimate but more efficient
first cost matching cost algorithm
second one even using many after
now paper
section give required introduce notion set
then section previous density estimation algorithms minimum distance estimate using
next section present our algorithms
first one estimate computational cost
second one call minimum only linear computational cost after
section explore density estimation algorithms
section give examples previous
paper focus case when finite order compare computational our estimates previous ones
however our results way classes well if computational complexity
