introduction
learning rewards stochastic unknown environment
algorithms choice strategy central
examine problem markov decision process framework
while simple methods like used known their behavior
recently number efficient algorithms been some them also exist
review methods section
several sources construct new algorithm efficient
new algorithm initial model described section
section show many algorithms including way
use fact policy time high probability
section provides experimental comparison between number other methods some problems
our results section
section review necessary markov decision processes task
