introduction
hidden markov models statistics machine learning applications recognition biological sequence alignment pattern classification
distribution over sequence states observations states form markov observations independent given sequence states
} most fundamental task related problem sequence states observations
distribution state sequence given observations theorem } where thought constant
state sequence then estimated sequence most likely states maximum probability estimation } inference problem problem
statistical point view distribution distribution one system variables energy function } at
sequence observations thus field
suggested using matrix algorithm
present context also known algorithm
algorithm complexity linear sequence length number states
more complexity same matrix times vector
while simple models few states complex models
simple mechanism leading state space presence memory underlying markov each observation multiple states
all cases model reduced standard via state space but state space memory length
leads memory length
paper several new algorithms problem
our basic when memory length large matrix using mean field
study proposed method model used dna
case one underlying dna sequence signal base type at several
effective memory length scales sequence length thus making matrix
paper follows
next section will define model study section dna
section matrix algorithm several low complexity approximation
after few bounds numerical results section
