present support vector
they natural matrix
no additional parameter setting choosing learning rate required
experiments demonstrate convergence good
analyze rates convergence bounds
test performance several datasets using various report generalization errors standard
introduction
support vector now used many classification problems machine learning due their use ability
basic case input data corresponding two groups into higher space where them
used into higher space explicitly
problem there efficient algorithms solve
using method applied
although methods efficient their setting learning rate
subset selection methods alternative approach problem
at high level they work function at each into two fixed set where constant set variables being current
methods though efficient space time still require heuristic between fixed sets
alternative algorithm general problem been applied
algorithm called uses solution
does not require any heuristics setting learning rate choosing how set
paper problem demonstrate matrix algorithm
very practice due its learning rate parameter low computational complexity
new allows us output value kernel function greater
kernel not very since their set many popular even degree etc
new all good properties algorithm low computational complexity
furthermore new algorithm than previous solution problem both provided practice
also show how solve problem using new algorithm
