introduction
paper applications sparse component analysis clustering feature selection problems particular focus gene expression data analysis
sparse methods had significant impact many statistics particular regression classification see among others
our sparse tools potential methods statistical results both more more robust than classical analyses while up little statistical
component analysis large scale data
linear data variables often called factors components maximum amount
only few leading matrix so applied very large scale data sets
one key however factors linear all all factor
means while model information few key factors factors themselves still using all observed variables
many applications direct physical biology example each might specific financial gene
cases having only few components would improve factors
sparse between two power most information data making factors involve only few variables
when used clustering sparse factors will allow us identify clusters action only few variables
methods produce sparse factors include where value algorithms called
method optimization problem technique based norm
very recently also proposed approach optimal solutions small problems uses method approximate solution larger ones
what follows give introduction problem describe how optimization algorithm was
most numerical step algorithm matrix our key numerical here show using only current produce approximation while computational
then show gene expression data sets using sparse simple clustering very relevant genes compared other techniques feature
paper follows
section introduction sparse our algorithm numerical called available
section describe application sparse clustering feature selection gene expression data
