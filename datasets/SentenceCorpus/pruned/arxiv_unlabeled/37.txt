method developed
practical principle events
method probability event means family probabilistic models
method been extended optimization optimal event event
rather good when function optimization
now two conditions needed good convergence method
first necessary family models optimal events
also function should
paper consider case model family stochastic functions
will shown simple examples could when
alternative method investigated compared random examples order issue
introduction
method been developed
simulation events
algorithm importance sampling event based family sampling
importance sampling obtained samples samples events parameters sampling its distance selection importance
optimal events related objective events method been extended optimization problems method been many problems
however method make some assumptions
first been made context
simulation family should contain support first condition cannot case stochastic problem
second condition
but there some cases where not possible all solutions family
indeed solutions may not typically case some dynamic problems example strategy tree against computer
both optimal observation
paper point out simple examples necessary convergence classical method
questions does algorithm solve stochastic problems } selection within may not work without rather good estimation objective functional
selection possible answer
assume family does not contain all solutions
algorithm will stochastic approximation optimal solution
approximation best possible within family
our answer question not negative
but some usually will question
paper some questions
case stochastic optimization tests simple random examples order compare convergence various methods global next section principle method
section will consider case where optimal solution not sampling family
proposed studied
section stochastic problems considered
two simple investigated thus some convergence
different then compared method several random examples
particular method sample selection proposed possible alternative stochastic problems
