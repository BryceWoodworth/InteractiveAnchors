introduction
time series modeling long important history
systems over new methods account many natural
result now well known systems produce highly correlated time series not under statistical assumptions distributions
one novel methods hidden structure processes key modeling prediction
alternative modeling approaches computational introduced stochastic systems optimal predictor many system properties directly
notion state introduced
effective states those variables past its present information past predicts future
following here investigate problem learning predictive models time series particular attention hidden variables
do using information method together complexity control method discussed
necessary learning finite data

out relationship between computational information method
here make mathematical times series new method
time series prediction resulting method call optimal
since effect theory use general optimal between model complexity approximation accuracy
theory discussed

show important limit prediction model complexity not underlying previously defined within framework computational
shows effect hidden variables
result structural models
example one fundamental entropy rate original system
extended optimal estimation
when probabilities estimated finite data errors due statistical probability estimates must taken into account order
demonstrate how work number example stochastic processes known structure
