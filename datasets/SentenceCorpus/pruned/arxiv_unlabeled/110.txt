made recent sampling distributions
introduction
component analysis statistical technique dimension reduction
often used data analysis objective understanding structure data
represent high data points called variables used data etc
also used step before regression clustering
context however typically does not performance due analysis
original high data where
note used so vector
assume data so
one common taking linear combination components where
} where
take so linear
given optimal linear given
good representation original
thus aim
shown associated its called first component
define components respect total error where components
linear procedure since based linear combination components
several been proposed
most one statistical literature proposed
defined each point all data points whose point
thus defined through data points
although computational makes difficult approach higher
other approaches including neural networks kernel been proposed
probabilistic models probabilistic approach
advantage probabilistic modeling including mechanism density modeling degree new data point observations
model defined through observation } linear relationship between variable data points matrix not

note assume data observation model should parameter
mean prior likelihood over after over shown when noise level maximum likelihood will } where matrix value
thus natural
mixture used model structure data
after over distribution if data not
mixture models distribution mixture components each component observation model if observation mixture component
thus mixture each mixture component defined different linear while clustering defined original space
over still same using distribution
maximization over performed using algorithm taking mixture data
experiments showed model wide
also note when using data point must also mixture component more each mixture observation
information cannot variable
another approach probabilistic based processes been proposed
same observation model but instead over over independent prior resulting distribution where matrix variables
one another kernel matrix achieve
regression problem unknown need found optimization likelihood
computational complexity process approach number data points although approximation algorithm designed reduce complexity
propose novel bayesian approach both
model based observation model similar but two differences
first linear defined through matrix instead
second linear our model dependent corresponding variable
linear different space related markov random field prior over space matrices makes model
model estimated sampling distribution both space space
computational each sampling number data points
paper next section present model discuss sampling estimation procedure
since might not distribution some also provided
some experiments out section using both data data
section some possible model
