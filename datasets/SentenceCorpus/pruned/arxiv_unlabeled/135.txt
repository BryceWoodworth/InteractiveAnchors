study sets random sequences where family probability distributions depending real parameter
case when probability distribution consistent exists show set all random sequences positive if only if parameter real number
family show set where set all random sequences taken over all positive
introduction
use theory analyze sets sequences random respect probability distributions
let family probability distributions where real number given consistent exists family
family real parameter example family
theorem shows set all random sequences positive if only if parameter value real number
property sequences no if set all sequences property
respect model probability when real parameters empirical only their i e elements some sets
example random sequences generated bayesian mixture using prior
case set all sequences random respect mixture positive
give simple our previous result theorem set all binary sequences random sequences positive
particular sequences respect each probability distribution
use result prove theorem
theorem shows probabilistic machine probability close random sequence parameter not random respect each probability distribution
result bayesian statistical approach all possible cases random sequences
