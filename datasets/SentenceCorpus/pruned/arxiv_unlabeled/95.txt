recent clustering methods technique data clustering
methods need solve whose computational complexity where number data samples
paper based clustering method proposed clustering problem
its performance clustering algorithms but more efficient computational complexity
show distance observed property called our algorithm used data sets complex clusters noise
moreover no parameters number clusters need set our algorithm
introduction
data clustering important technique many applications data image processing pattern recognition computer
much effort been research
basic principle assumption design clustering algorithm consistency data within same each other while data different clusters relatively far
according principle approach clustering where every sample then most similar pairs clusters them into larger clusters
technique depends local structure data without global function
observed approach often when data set clusters
above consistency assumption methods like also assume data set some underlying structures distribution thus any two clusters
case distance clustering
introduction many recent methods like clustering consider clusters data set may more complex other than sample
general case techniques used achieve distance measure among samples
distance matrix play key role clustering
problems clusters proposed clustering local scale data structure distance matrix considered
results been demonstrated clustering most clustering technique
however most current kernel related clustering methods including clustering kernel framework need solve high computational cost when data set large
paper clustering problem where clusters complex
using distance measure observed property called show if consistency condition clusters arbitrary new space where clusters more algorithm
performance algorithms our algorithm does not need solve more efficient computational complexity than algorithms whose where number samples data set
paper follows
section discuss distance measure through graph model data set
section algorithm proposed its application our clustering algorithm
section our algorithm reduce computational complexity
section shows experimental results some data sets data sets together algorithm algorithms
given section
