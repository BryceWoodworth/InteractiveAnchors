prove existence average distance points convex set
corresponding existence result optimal algorithm learning when data target functions distribution
introduction
let measure metric let convex
will show function defined % its global minimum at unique point
while existence minimum seems difficult prove
similar problem been considered
define so integration finite
since problem rather likely above result exists literature just been able find
