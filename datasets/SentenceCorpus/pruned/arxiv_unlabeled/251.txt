paper present two classes bayesian approaches problem
our first class methods bayesian include all models family their
our second class methods uses process distributions over unknown distributions
examples real datasets show our tests best methods task even them average datasets
introduction
paper associated test called test
tests various life social studies one may find out if two classes patients show different response drug disease
analysis one may compare measurements different find out if they same distribution before them into one order increase sample size
one may compare measurements brain signals under different stimuli whether brain activity affected stimuli
social one may compare whether behavior group people eg when they different across
financial one could example compare set performed at during different find out if there change activity financial
while question been studied statistics data there less work data review section
only machine learning approach problem kernel method using means two samples universal kernel space its test statistics but interest subject studies
here approach problem bayesian perspective
bayesian problem would terms factor likelihood data were generated according hypothesis same distribution hypothesis different distributions
however how define two question many been given bayesian literature specific problem application one example bayesian used data analysis
our goal paper define two general classes tests represent problem but not specific application
they designed between general idea using factors testing problems studied literature
define class bayesian two sample tests based process mixture models
use process general unknown distributions long history statistics
however although problem depends testing whether data one two unknown distributions bayesian approaches based density models not been
here propose explore method using process mixture
best our knowledge only work related bayesian test versus model data
different but related question since hypothesis
also define bayesian test where model data family
test bayesian who assume samples
paper follows
section will review existing approaches problem data some differences between bayesian hypothesis testing
section common core our two bayesian test before test section test section
section will evaluate performance our tests comparing methods field
