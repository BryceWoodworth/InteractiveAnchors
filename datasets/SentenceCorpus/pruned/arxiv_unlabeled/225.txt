new data set over years
using level our algorithm probability predictions disease
estimate classification accuracy probability predictions into predictions
our algorithm makes errors than almost any linear combination level one taken scale
power our algorithm use test hypothesis do not contain useful information prediction disease at particular time before
our algorithm values better than those produced algorithm been previously applied data set
our proposed algorithm more prediction new data prediction algorithm cancer
introduction
early detection cancer important since do not appear disease
leads treatment
using significantly quality
however less at early too make use
our goal investigate whether existing methods online prediction improve quality detection disease demonstrate information useful cancer early disease
combination decision rule form where level taken sets described below
consider prediction each case sample two samples individuals chosen close possible case sample respect attributes conditions processing
given samples different individuals one sample predict cancer
framework was first described
authors analyze cancer data set show information help provide more predictions than itself some before
paper use same framework set decision rules combined derive algorithm better some sense than any rules
our research use different more recent cancer data set authors larger number items than
decision rules proposed using online prediction online prediction found } thus our own decision rule
paper use algorithm described because allows us output probability measure given best theoretical type prediction
order estimate classification accuracy probability predictions into predictions maximum rule weight 1 maximum predicted probability weight other samples then weights
show our algorithm more predictions than particular fact more experiments not described here show all particular
well different disease
when testing hypothesis do not contain useful information prediction disease at its early our algorithm better values comparison algorithm best addition our algorithm requires
our paper follows
section describe methods use give predictions
section short description data set work
show our experiments results section into description probability prediction algorithm detection at different before
section our paper
