introduction
recent years increases available computational power data interest dimension reduction methods
development over past several new algorithms designed structure data et al clustering et al
despite their different each algorithms requires positive kernel matrix
fact methods their long central place statistical data analysis
positive kernel matrix variety classical approaches components analysis most data analysis determine data classification used metric data
result their exact appropriate kernel matrix computational complexity methods scales turn either
if complexity exact large datasets computational problems both classical methods
one alternative construct kernel based directly set examples been selected
selection thus overall computational apply algorithms directly subset their original chosen their results at computational cost
while often simply sampling their data at random show article how one may improve upon approach manner at only higher computational cost
review linear methods introduce optimal selection problem
then provide analysis framework selection turn clear set between computational complexity quality approximation
finally case study applications field computer
