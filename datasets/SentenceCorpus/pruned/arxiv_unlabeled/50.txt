introduction
article introduction mathematical theory
present model optimal learning agent arbitrary unknown environment
may defined systems their analysis
natural system input output
more
many like problems pattern recognition classification learning optimization environment processing knowledge many more
every however seems difficult
most if not all known more some utility function
therefore sufficient study eg \ biological goal humans
goal systems should useful humans
problem special cases know utility function environment agent will
mathematical theory solve problems
assume computational
first important observation does not make problem
problems become but nature
because itself latter problems not algorithm
other problem not yet been well defined
one may view mathematical
universal theory sequential decision making universal theory
derived optimal way predicting future data given previous provided data probability distribution
approach optimal decision making agent unknown environment
main idea unknown environmental distribution universal distribution
state space space complete
universal theory without parameters making no assumptions about environment distribution
complexity perspective model optimal universal case active agents
perspective new algorithm may all computational problems previous learning algorithms
there strong most agent possible
number problem classes including sequence prediction games function learning how model solve them
major model
problem construct algorithm still more than any other time length agent
time order
other discussed order relation problem theory other approaches
article introduction model
treatment many see section at end particular
section also provides original information theory sequential decision theory
theory sequential decisions very general form called model actions may depend arbitrary past events
discuss parameters including size spaces agent their universal choice

how sense possible at all been subject long
principle multiple probability theory
all aspects into one theory inference based universal probability distribution related complexity length program
convergence unknown true environmental distribution loss bounds arbitrary loss functions finite shown
sense there no other predictor better all environments better at least one also shown
view results problem sequence prediction optimal solution
active case learning algorithms usually used if unknown
they if state space either small been made small generalization techniques
algorithms work only e g \ domains problems versus learning rate
solution proposed here universal prior include action conditions model resulting model optimal
investigate what optimal agent universal optimal etc
other discussed order relation problem
show how number problem classes into general model
they include sequence prediction games function learning
first each problem class its natural way known then construct within model show their
then consider
main goal understand sense problems
major more only makes
problem construct model still any other time length algorithm
time order
solution requires universal machine within theory system
finally discuss some general interest
various including actions choice spaces treatment information agents
further research including approximation knowledge training
also include some number
