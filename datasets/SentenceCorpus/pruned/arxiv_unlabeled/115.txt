what concept classes learned algorithm whose output does not depend too any one input specific training example
more investigate learning algorithms notion provides strong where information about database information about individuals present several basic results demonstrate general learning several models previously studied standard learning
our goal understanding required learning terms samples time interaction
demonstrate computational constraints possible learn any concept class using sample size concept class
therefore almost specifically if concept class algorithm sample complexity output size then learned using number samples
also present efficient class functions
result similarity between learning noise learning both must robust small changes since thought very learn given random classification noise
local response algorithms practical class algorithms
provide local learning algorithms
show concept class local algorithm if only if statistical model
therefore local learning algorithms similarity learning noise local learning learning algorithms include most known learning algorithms
finally present between power local learning algorithms
because learning result also adaptive learning

examine two basic computational learning correct learning model statistical model
concept function examples class if any distribution examples one given limited examples according some target concept find small hypothesis predicts high probability over future examples taken same distribution
model learning algorithm number examples
model instead examples directly some properties i e examples given estimate up small error probability random example chosen property
learning than learning
model statistical database vector where each been individual
when how well algorithm concept class assume database random examples generated \ underlying distribution target concept
how not
instance example might history whether individual had
algorithm learn predict whether individual had based history generated according
require algorithm examples not only
above not each history
more output should not significantly affected if particular example arbitrary all
contrast utility respect distribution notion
hence when analyze our do not make any assumptions underlying distribution
assumptions particular would presence knowledge also called knowledge information might knowledge distribution over examples might very different
