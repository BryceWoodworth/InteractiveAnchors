introduction
often discovery novel patterns
mathematical models physical
but new data sets
examples include experiments but range social
all data far what any human analyze directly hand
new pattern discovery model
understanding model making critical provide theoretical
show how basic provide method models achieve different
show appropriate method
without would only another approach statistical inference its own assumptions about natural pattern
our point observation natural systems process produce
theory then information structures its
any physical theory mechanism what part observed phenomenon due underlying structure what
considered noise typically
theory therefore depends what structure what often
what good theory though
information relevant
one answer question time series information about future time series relevant
forecasting though models often test how well they predict new data hence general importance model information prediction
typically there many models explain given data set between two models predictive one smaller less complex model
however more complex model achieve smaller prediction error than less complex model
between model complexity prediction error finding between structure noise
between mechanism event event being random long history but how one still very active
time series analysis take one example account produced not assumptions independent distributed data
requires directly notion structure pattern
essential prediction structure part underlying states
computational process communication information past future present
forecasting future two different if they result same prediction
general prediction probabilistic given future distribution
resulting relation groups all give same future } resulting space states
states model predictive means all information past time series contains about future
result state past future independent property call because states property they past future } where
related fact predictive
see note
furthermore note any states when past known then future distribution not } states thus
therefore fact states all information between past entropy predictive information
states unique sufficient statistics time series prediction all predictive information at maximum
statistical complexity compared all other predictive
measures amount information must order all entropy past future
states basis against alternative models should compared
