indeed consider family stochastic distributed dynamics prove sense convergence probabilistic processes towards their limit i

focus then class stochastic dynamics where out related dynamics
% studied evolutionary game theory
using known about convergence discuss convergence initial stochastic general games there might but when convergence considered stochastic algorithms towards
games functions call games stochastic dynamics
prove any potential game hence any potential game game function
games function prove function over stochastic dynamics
leads way provide bounds their time convergence
particular many classes games been considered literature including several game scenarios games
introduction
consider where agents learn their experiments small
might example about their about their
% will assume rational
% assume agents rational
understanding when whole towards rational situations i e sense game theory
natural dynamics stochastic distributed since agents their strategies based their local knowledge since agents often involved games where global hence local description whole global not possible
% also dynamics would global knowledge several dynamics been considered recently game theory literature
up our knowledge been dynamics based best response requires global description
stochastic global description been considered
however considered dynamics rather order efficient convergence time bounds still based
consider here more general dynamics discuss when one may convergence
could lead consider any dynamics respect utility relation evolutionary game theory literature
propose here dynamics lead dynamics related dynamics
game theory seen version classical game theory our long term aim better understand evolutionary game theory
could also dynamics seen strategies strategies long term objective learning methods could seen point methods find

strategy probability distribution over strategy chosen probability
let strategies
any strategy considered strategy where vector probability vector component hence
let space all strategies
strategy strategies all strategy
following classical often where vector strategies all other
allow games whose payoffs may only assume strategy known each random cost expected value
particular expected cost strategy
some classes games
several classes % games where based common set where each associated cost function been considered game theory literature
games called elements i e
hence strategy space having weight subset strategy some
cost task under strategies where machine % defined weights tasks
games called
hence strategy space subset strategy subset
cost under strategies where number % use number
games weights associated one instead
task games games called elements i e
each machine assumed function input set tasks cost each
cost under strategies then given
functions considered associated corresponding time task
example without order increasing weights processing times
games particular task games games particular games
game whose weights particular game
potential games
all classes games related potential games introduced game potential game if there exists some function strategies all strategies one
