learn multiple related tasks under relationship between tasks
domain adaptation classifier structure but learning structure
our model seen several previously proposed learning models well three distinct data sets
introduction
consider two related but distinct domain adaptation learning
both involve learning related multiple data sets
learn multiple same problem over data different distributions
learn multiple different problems over data same distribution
seen bayesian perspective natural solution model
however when there more than two learned i e more than two domains more than two tasks question all related
if not what their relationship
address two models one one models

derive algorithm makes use recently developed efficient inference algorithms
several problems show our model
our models common structure based unknown
key difference between model model what information across
consider case linear regression linear regression
extended processes
domain useful model assume there single classifier all domains
context bayesian modeling weight vector associated linear classifier generated according structure
other hand one does not same weight vector do well all problems
instead common assumption features similar ways between tasks
bayesian model structure associated linear generated according structure
