many real world applications data cannot represented vectors
those situations one possible solution rely measures comparison between observations
been data described only through their matrix
algorithm provides both linear clustering vector data
algorithm high cost makes difficult use data sets
paper propose new algorithm provides important reduction theoretical cost without its outcome results same ones obtained original algorithm
moreover introduce methods result very short times
theoretical cost model real world data clustering problem
also demonstrate proposed methods reduce factor up time fast algorithm over standard
introduction
available data analysis methods based vector model observations described fixed number real values i e vectors fixed finite vector space
many real world data strongly model
common instance variable size data
they natural example online recognition where representation length because conditions
other data instance strongly numerical complex they very difficult represent vector space
while work been classical data analysis methods data tree graph neural based processing data also } well data size there still strong need efficient data analysis methods applied any type data
way design methods rely one one comparison between observations
general possible define similarity measure between arbitrary data long comparing them
general data analysis algorithms based between observations more complex than their vector but they universal therefore applied any data
moreover they allow one rely specific rather than vector representation data general observations
many algorithms been use between data
clustering field algorithm been data under
more recently approaches based been used propose another class principle
following taken several adaptation data been proposed
proposed probabilistic used directly data
been also used
present paper focus adaptation proposed where was applied protein sequence clustering problem well clustering problems
generalization called also known considered method
were applied time series data data
major its time very high especially when compared standard vector
well known algorithm number input data
number see section
propose paper several basic algorithm allow much
nature algorithm cannot because data described number one one
standard algorithm cost where number observations number clusters algorithm produce whereas our lead cost
moreover specific strategy actual even more
important property all our obtained algorithm same results standard algorithm
paper follows
section adaptation data obtain theoretical cost
section describe our proposed new algorithm well techniques its time practice
finally evaluate algorithm section
evaluation theoretical cost model shows methods reduce time
evaluation data real world data clustering problem
