functions based test cases very common genetic
process learning task inference models limited number samples
paper two methods improve generalization 1 selection individuals using three data sets 2 application order reduce complexity solutions
results using binary classification show while accuracy test sets less compared results mean tree size obtained tested methods significantly reduced
introduction
particularly problems learning tasks error between obtained limited number test cases training data using
indeed classical examples regression only simple learning problems i e regression binary classification learning
early years problems were using single data set results same data set was used evaluate during evolution
was fact problems used only potential
given learning algorithm data used during training perform data same application domain
hence important report results set data was not used during learning
what call paper two data sets training set used learning algorithm test set used report performance algorithm data good generalization robustness
even though been widely applied long time still results data sets were used during evolution training phase
problem been see should less less common future
two data sets results learning algorithms training set
but does not itself training set
common approach third data set set learning algorithm measure its generalization
set useful learning algorithm when occurs learning machine generalization
third data set used neural networks applied learning
but approach important significant amount data training set learning process
indeed training set more real data distribution more learning algorithm expected robust solutions
objective paper investigate effect set individuals learning application
another develop learning algorithms generate simple solutions
principle states between solutions quality solutions must
another minimum description length principle states model one amount information needed model data given model
preference solutions more likely complex solution specific information training set thus training set compared solution
but should taken too much complexity discovery more complex yet more accurate solutions
there strong between complexity learning control growth program size
even though complexity not same phenomenon some generated no effect actual complexity solutions most mechanisms proposed control also used complexity solutions obtained learning
paper study learning algorithm
more specifically investigate two techniques increase generalization performance complexity 1 use set individuals well 2 use reduce complexity generated models
techniques tested using binary classification problems vectors taken learning sets mathematical vectors
approach tested different data sets
even if proposed techniques tested specific context argue they extended situations where used learning algorithm
