prediction also known universal prediction individual sequences learning theory making any stochastic assumptions about way observations generated
goal class prediction rules often function space popular various classes entropy provides framework known bounds metric entropy various sets function bounds performance prediction strategies
paper direct approach prediction via metric entropy including other approaches
introduction
result prediction given class prediction strategies there prediction strategy almost well best prediction strategies class
paper performance prediction strategy will measured distance between its predictions true observations assumed real complex numbers
different methods predictions following strong algorithms forecasting etc \ tend their each well classes specific but not classes different size
paper will apply simple general method based metric entropy classes wide range
typically method does not give optimal results but its results often not much than those given methods especially classes not too
since method almost new known results
another metric entropy method not clear how whereas many other methods very efficient
therefore results obtained method only first step should other prediction strategies both more efficient having better performance
simple result about existence universal prediction strategy class continuous prediction rules
performance universal strategy long good performance any continuous prediction rule but do not estimate rate at approaches latter
following section where general results about performance based metric entropy
example case where class set performance become metric entropy larger
core paper according types metric out
type i metric entropy order case classes
type order contains various classes functions
key most important case order eg classes
classes type considered metric entropy even
class always given
question how prediction strategies against various classes compare each other
previous section standard methods used results statistical learning theory section several further research
there no real i just apply known results about metric entropy prediction
i will useful
