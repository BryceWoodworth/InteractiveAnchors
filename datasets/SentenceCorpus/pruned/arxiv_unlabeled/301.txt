methods designed predictive accuracy predictions multiple machine learning models
recent work shown use additional each example performance methods but reported gains significant training time
here present linear technique linear accuracy while linear regression stability
model predictions using themselves linear functions
technique was key solution second place recently
significant increases accuracy over standard linear demonstrated
introduction
technique predictions models given learning algorithm
algorithm model predictions form set predictions
many machine learning had using related techniques prediction accuracy level obtained any individual models
some also will use terms here
since its introduction wide variety problems including large datasets machine learning
one recent example power model was
using different models
indeed solution was at multiple levels i e
suggests model may function conditions used
instance context where predict preferences various amount data may significantly depending under
model may more than model b who many but model b may model who only few
many researchers developed approaches improve accuracy regression basis information
additional source information like number number since was often will use here
linear regression most common learning algorithm used regression
many linear models well known
computational cost involved models via solution linear system usually always
they typically require minimum
functional form itself
at minimum linear models often initial against performance more complex models
linear models do not at first appear well
if simply models form one overall independent variables combined algorithm then resulting functional form does not appear relative given predictions various models should depend since associated each model constant values
previous work indeed suggested models needed make good use
complex many many use techniques
number number items particular predicted various parameters some models were all used within overall
almost all cases algorithms used were i e either neural network decision tree
system called additional models presented
tested but results showed most using number number were also two most used
linear regression model model used algorithms model best results
linear regression was least approaches
not only application area where use other dynamic approaches model been
classification problem context linear regression algorithm entropy predicted class probabilities although they found limited tasks machine learning
approach does not use per but does adaptive approach described
they present algorithm based changes models depending estimates models within particular input space
thus literature suggests approaches usually required order make good use when
method presented paper however while being via linear regression techniques
method does not simply additional against
associated models linear functions
thus technique all stability associated linear regression while still significant accuracy
approach was important part solution second place
