learning convex body mean finding set having at most relative difference input body
prove lower bound construct learn family convex
our family very simple based error
introduction
consider following given random points convex body would like learn body few samples possible
question paper number samples but not computational approximation
our main result will show about samples
problem special case statistical problem information about probability distribution samples
example one approximate body sample size linear
other hand sample size not approximate convex body within constant factor see section here
note known approximation algorithms e g do not work setting they need random points various chosen input body
our problem also work learning theory e g where one given samples generated according distribution each sample depending whether body
different distributions another difference between learning setting one only positive examples
give algorithm matching lower bound learning convex samples chosen according distribution
their algorithm time they also show lower bound
problem learning convex sets random samples them was
they time algorithm learning
another related direction work distributions
our lower bound result like also allows
note known convex requires number if algorithm learning requires number because if algorithm learn body then also estimate its
define notion learning need distance between
natural choice our setting consider total variation distance distribution each body see section
will use term random convex body when random point
lower bound constant
similar possible our particular
our compared
furthermore our learn family
our makes use error
our knowledge error new may find further applications
see section some further comparison } idea find large family convex two 1 any two family almost 2 yet they sense small sample random points any body one
since any two almost even body would allow one determine
will also approximate
first construct family although not almost large difference
will then able construct family almost taking first family
first family natural described
consider generalization convex vectors where vector
its base its other normal through its
if small then any subset will result convex
will show later choose so all
call family our different parameters but there does not any between problem studied there problem random point body family one if point one then present one
therefore if number at most then one about most so algorithm cannot body
but do not large difference small if two differ just one but them having difference at least large random
will do will more binary length each value if value
any two our family differ many their corresponding large distance
large sets good error
family obtain another family almost taking while property many random samples do not
also known been used many times before particular but not its use setting similar
our family also theory

useful
