introduction
paper discuss classical how approximate finite set relatively large finite subset object
application finite set problem many data dynamics
first hypothesis whether
if point


average distance component analysis
one most data analysis
now
generalization many been made answer
two them especially important our
algorithm take finite metric space metric into best initial structure image b best approximation
algorithm several variables between
some initial approximation
each step algorithm current approximation
define
next approximation } here step size function
there many ways whole algorithm
idea very applications but know what algorithm but no independent result algorithm work
define solution problem some energy functional were not very
known probability distribution were introduced through data distribution
was into mathematical notion every point all points into
should just data space usually domain finite only one typically into point
order introduce become essential part algorithms
give most popular take consider resulting approximation see example
several original algorithms finite datasets were developed during well many applications idea
about at method data approximation based energy was proposed see there
method based between membrane
following introduce two terms
allows one apply standard i e system linear sparse matrix
