algorithm selection typically based models algorithm performance learned during training sequence
recent work online approach performance model used selection sequence problem
resulting was represented problem using existing game but required setting arbitrary bound algorithm thus optimal regret
paper propose framework algorithm selection problem information unknown bound losses
existing game bound its expected regret also resulting algorithm selection technique
present experiments set
introduction
research machine learning us variety alternative algorithms many problems
algorithms often performance quality computational cost depending particular problem instance being other words there no single algorithm
while approach still most popular algorithm selection not new form consistent dynamic field research area
many selection methods learning large training set performance data different algorithms assumed
data used learn model problem algorithm pairs expected performance some probability distribution performance
model later used each new problem instance only algorithm expected give best results
while approach might actually computational cost initial training sample performance data via set training problem each instance at least each available algorithms more if algorithms
furthermore training assumed future ones model not after training
other words there between algorithm different problem at learning model best based predictions
typically algorithm selection size training set chosen
our previous work online view algorithm selection only input available set algorithms unknown performance sequence problem
rather than problem set into training test set model each time instance use algorithm selection next instance
problems theoretical framework online setting
one important application problem algorithm selection most existing assume bound losses available
issue bound
paper introduce existing problem allows unknown bound losses while bound expected regret
allows us propose version algorithm selection framework introduced
result online algorithm selection method first our knowledge bound regret
