present algorithm called learning make decisions situations where payoff only one choice observed rather than all choices
algorithm setting binary classification one any existing binary classification algorithm information setting
show tree optimal reduction binary classification
particular regret at most times regret binary classifier uses where number choices no reduction binary classification do better
reduction also optimal both at training test time just work example make prediction
experiments show generally better than several alternative approaches
introduction
paper about learning make decisions feedback settings where payoff only one choice observed rather than all choices
example consider site other based history search unique unique every decision
after either not
type feedback standard learning setting since whether not would had different instead
online version problem policy uses observed feedback improve its future choices
good solution problem must explore different choices feedback
problem site however more complex
they observed many interactions would like them initial policy may then further online
since decisions been made online solutions not
use data need methods learning feedback
paper about family algorithms learning feedback settings
since any solution policy form algorithm online learning setting algorithm proposed here also used online
indeed some our experiments online setting
