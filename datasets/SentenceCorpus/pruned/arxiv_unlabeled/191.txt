main objective work derive exact approximate robust estimates under large class statistical including entropy information
introduction
work estimates under model large class statistical
one \ process unknown outcome
prior uncertainty about set % typically chosen between 1 2
sets probability distributions often called probabilities hence model
term use robust instead
several fundamental problems other approaches uncertainty
instance representation principle principle bayesian treatment prior
form sufficient data size
statistical usually also depend chosen so set leads set
instance expected lead robust estimate
robust mean also been derived
bayesian like depend only through i e \
main objective work derive approximate exact general expected also called predictive entropy expected information particular
results key
suggests instance use inference problems decision problems where some function
one application inference robust structures based information
