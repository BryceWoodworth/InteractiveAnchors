introduction
there at least two similarity
similarity between attributes similarity between
when two words high degree similarity call them
when two pairs high degree similarity they
often form b c d example
over over

there high degree similarity between pair pair
fact basis several mathematical theories
section more at between similarity
seems similarity reduced similarity since similar
general reduction
consider
not similar
only similar
many algorithms been proposed similarity between two words
measures similarity been studied due their applications problems information sense
other hand since measures similarity not well developed measures similarity potential applications similarity not well known
many problems involve would algorithm similarity
discuss related problems natural processing information information more section
paper vector space model information
given search
order similarity between each
almost all search measure similarity using approach similarity
they used vector patterns represent relation between pair words
section approach similarity
section present algorithm similarity call analysis
algorithm large without
approach three 1 patterns derived instead using fixed set patterns 2 value used frequency data given pair pair generated one words
section our experimental evaluation questions

section evaluate performance set pairs
