introduction
given set observations
random vector fixed but unknown distribution question values random variable take given
predictive one often other characteristics distribution than eg one often more than its prediction
environmental one typically behavior i e value its related environmental variables
main classical see eg p information two random variables
classical result extended towards setting learning theory where random variables arbitrary fixed distribution
information probabilistic derived using classical
described relationship other results information eg using information matrix based assumptions eg distribution free context
i support derived extended setting its theoretical properties derived relation method convex made shown how estimate linear program
while studied literature eg regression argue question setting statistical learning theory pattern recognition support vector see
main difference existing literature classical regression other predictor methods no made underlying mean regression regression risk point prediction dependent variable pattern recognition
here target instead change distribution
one i what extent estimated support i e does actual support what probability actual support i e what probability new sample occur estimated } section main result relation convex
practical perspective section provides further how optimal estimate found linear program
