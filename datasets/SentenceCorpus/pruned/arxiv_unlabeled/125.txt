despite its same rule shown setting finite number solutions any maximum
experiments comparing tasks involving linear also reported
introduction
widely larger solution greater ability learning machine
online learning algorithm binary linear classification does not aim at any
problem instead finding optimal at core support vector
their efficient however fact they require problem
interest alternative large many based algorithm
algorithm long before standard however setting known able only up maximum
various algorithms larger maximum rules
algorithms include
different approach one most algorithms above was also developed loss through stochastic
there however between algorithms since their form constant learning rate
approach very recent
question answer present work whether possible achieve maximum larger than while original rule
end construct whole new family algorithms at least one convergence finite number solution any unknown maximum
family algorithms classical will
algorithms family being very will performance various classification tasks
