contrast most existing approaches only space objects through similarity
given two reference objects object reference object object
model behavior human making about similarity but not numerical values between objects
using best obtain every object database other objects according their distance
call position object rank respect
difficulty using depends underlying space
use two different underlying space property
first one rank average difference t
other objects more given section
second one framework notion approximate more given section
factor
develop search algorithm data structure allows us high probability questions
learning requires questions total need total
also provide approximate search algorithm
finally show lower bound average number questions search phase algorithms when all possible questions learning phase given
also introduce functions same value objects based objects obtained similarity
one application demonstrate one point function where only depends rank
introduction
consider situation where search database but do not know underlying relationships between objects
particular may difficult may not
situations common objects where human perception may involved
taken different
indeed between feature vectors might far similarity perceived humans
either approximate classification may able determine relative object respect small number other objects
humans ability compare objects make about most similar ones though they not numerical value similarity
question how design search algorithms based binary similarity decisions type more like b than
more aim design algorithm given object eg object similar object among objects database
do so similarity given two reference objects object two reference objects most similar object
measure performance all our algorithms terms number questions need
database during learning phase use resulting search process
do not make assumption space database objects metric space
using one every object database other objects according their distance
call position object rank respect
relationship i e general
several new questions any space described its relationships
how much does fact rank some object t
some other object rank t
us about rank t

paper introduce notion rank see section
rank how related average
framework introduced approximate another way relationships
those us how similarity relationship give us notion
if information use rank information estimate other
paper will first investigate case where use hidden space input our algorithms
develop existing bounds search based similarity see section
also prove far know first lower bound average number questions asked search see section
then section what if no hidden space known therefore cannot used input algorithms
case cannot estimate limit if rank information
develop algorithms space objects likely similar objects tendency together
notion our
introduce notion section
one point very
function itself does not require any space input
however value choose depends rank
general both rank use hidden space how space
less more difficult search
particular if rank relationship very some objects far every other object information about those objects matrix very sparse
apply idea search but might useful other scenarios well
