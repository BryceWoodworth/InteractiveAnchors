research learning produced algorithms optimal decision making under uncertainty within two main types
first bayesian framework where increased computational time
because resulting task form dynamic problem belief tree number states
second type relatively simple algorithm shown small regret within framework
paper lower bound high probability bound optimal value function nodes bayesian belief tree similar bounds
bounds then used more efficient strategies tree
resulting algorithms compared algorithm well algorithm problems
introduction
recent work bayesian methods markov decision processes known markov decision processes well latter case been proposed
all methods computational problems most domains interest
sources
there may no representation current belief
especially true
under uncertainty requires model form tree where current pair all possible pairs
tree large very fast particularly case continuous observations actions
work second problem consider algorithms tree
since bayesian methods require tree performed view whole problem
setting problems there exist optimal simple methods
methods recently been extended tree search
work take advantage special structure belief order design algorithms nodes
sense tree problem bayesian methods also optimal problem develop tree algorithms solve problem
furthermore able derive lower bounds value nodes help limit amount search
developed tested setting algorithms exist
