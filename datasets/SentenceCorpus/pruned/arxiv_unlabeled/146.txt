state problem within framework machine learning use notion learning reduction classical solve different classification task binary
introduction
you given unknown state possible states where each state after class
how well you predict class unknown state
general question often literature state been studied at least far work field detection estimation theory
answer will depend parameters structure knowledge states dimension space states number unknown state you
paper take machine learning view problem learning task called classification
our main goal so new help solve task some its
other include learning tasks terms amount information needed complete them measured instance number states development framework used compare tasks
approach learning states was taken defined where was algorithm task clustering where goal group clusters states similar using similarity measure while states different clusters
model learning states paper model proposed where training not states
model finite number unknown state goal state few produce high probability hypothesis accuracy training
paper follows
first model learning world introduced section along notion learning reduction allows us together different learning tasks
section task binary classification described task defined
finally section
