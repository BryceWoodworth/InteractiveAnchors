introduction
graphs used complex structures including dna sequences
particular they used field computer where many problems graph matching problem
here nodes graphs local features image aspects between features both nodes i e they feature vectors
graph matching then finding between nodes two graphs they most when according
typically problem problem finding objective function local linear term structural term
main body research graph matching then been focused more accurate algorithms solve problem since functions used graph matching typically
question if given two graphs should optimal determined
example assume first two now assume same instead two image should optimal same both situations
if algorithm into account graphs optimal solutions will same since graph pair same both cases
standard way graph matching
paper address what approach
argue if know under pair graphs been then should take into account how graphs those conditions typically
however do not take information conditions explicitly into account since would
instead approach problem statistical inference perspective
first graphs number under same conditions those solve means e g database
then provide what understand optimal between resulting graphs
information then used learning algorithm space pairs graphs space
terms problem learning algorithm functions expected optimal test pair graphs expected they would had had they been training set
learning problem convex program means procedure
provide experimental evidence learning standard graph matching algorithms significantly their performance
fact show learning upon results so linear learning algorithm
also learning itself obtain results improve both accuracy over best existing
