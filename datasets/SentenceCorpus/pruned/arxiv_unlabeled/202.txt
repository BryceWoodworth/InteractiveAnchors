observation leads efficient algorithm testing both local global unique
our analysis new matrix call matrix matrix
introduction
real matrix
matrix number ways arbitrary values
order question any value must matrix certain class matrices
popular class matrices matrices limited rank problem matrix subset its attention
problem up variety settings
one problem where only small subset one would like their preference
data matrix all may because only few factors preferences
problem also computer problem structure motion well many other data analysis machine learning control other problems factor model
algorithms been proposed over years see eg
many algorithms rank convex set positive matrices solve convex optimization problem using
recently using techniques if pattern random then convex norm norm values vector high probability exact most matrices rank long number observed where some function
even more recently bound also provided efficient algorithm
recent results do not provide however solution more practical case pattern
given specific pattern would algorithm determine rank matrix
prior any existing algorithms important know if indeed unique
theory see eg propose efficient algorithm whether not possible complete matrix matrix rank
our proposed algorithm does not complete matrix but only if unique possible
introduce new matrix call matrix matrix theory
rank matrix property call
matrix large sparse its rank determined using methods
theory will also make between local global
between many results theory
our algorithm testing local based similar algorithm testing local was suggested whereas our algorithm testing global based recent global testing algorithm who
due large body existing work theory some future
paper follows
section contains results theory our algorithms based
section analyze problem particular case positive matrices present algorithms testing local global matrices
section analysis more common problem general matrices corresponding algorithms provided
section patterns either
particular present simple matrices rank cases
section results numerical simulations tested performance our algorithms while theoretical bounds matrices random patterns
