introduction
using framework probability shown always possible using make sequential probability any set statistical tests
result work other authors among them et al who consider only tests
result lower bound
show result only when increasing degree accuracy
when some level fixed present version example forecasting test any given method example was presented
example use forecasting game presented binary forecasting game
discuss forecasting algorithms section
framework considered section
present section original result universal forecasting prove our result forecasting version example forecasting
