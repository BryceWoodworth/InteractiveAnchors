introduction
maximum entropy principle principle inference
been applied statistical machine learning problems protein modeling prediction
one its some would concentration
here version phenomenon words case prior distribution over domain at hand available related limit theorem
provide strong generalization both concentration phenomenon limit theorem
section results section used existing some would maximum entropy due
way provide results two most maximum entropy principle
