prediction complex notion different people computer probabilistic theories very different
paper i will review some popular prediction argue theory learning prediction now
standard goal predictor learning theory small loss given loss function between predictions actual outcomes
learning version predictor perform almost well best strategies given class prediction strategies
predictions decisions made decision i e one whose decisions do not affect future outcomes
predictions probability considered probability rather than loss function procedure testing
two main approaches probability developed now mathematical probability theory but latter better uses learning theory discussed paper
important probability was universal testing procedure there exists forecasting strategy
forecasting strategy however not
its more practical obtained results probability theory
wide class forecasting shown any probability there exists forecasting strategy far probability
choosing probability ways
probability known used making good most procedure decisions optimal under principle minimum expected loss
i will describe its use prediction algorithms property universal consistency its more practical
paper i will discuss some learning possible further research changes i made compared
still rather than main part paper
introduction
paper based at learning theory
recent years aim at between learning work other game theory statistics information theory optimization
following i will argue some probability applied learning
paper i will use following predictions 2 decisions
they true but good
their quality typically loss function about
they tested if found predictions between
they if they various observed events
learning theory general learning particular consider
i will section simple result about there exists consistent prediction algorithm if loss function not required convex prediction
section section
will see more fundamental than
section how so relevant
section i will prove result section about universal consistency well its version
