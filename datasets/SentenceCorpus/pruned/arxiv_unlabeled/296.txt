study problem online regression
do not make any assumptions about input vectors outcomes
prove theoretical bound loss regression
also show bayesian regression thought online algorithm all linear
then consider case prove relative loss bounds popular bayesian regression regression
our main theoretical form
introduction
online prediction framework provided some input at each step predict outcome using input information previous
simple case statistics assumed each outcome value noise linear function input
prediction his loss at each step loss any certain class instead making statistical assumptions about data process
may certain strategies
predict almost well best all sequences
our main result theorem next section
loss regression
applied
loss best linear predictor
power result best at range its
both known new
example question
asked several researchers see
whether regression relative loss bound
regret term order under loss function
where number outcomes assumed
well all other section
rather than result
theorem itself much

rather than
not outcomes
since lower bounds loss
all natural bounds loss regression
our give some examples next section
most previous research online prediction
presence noise observations
consider predicting
distribution outcomes
use
bayesian regression prove predict well best
our theorem
loss theoretical
loss
algorithm apply was first used

similar bounds were obtained
theorem later used theorem
regression predicts mean bayesian regression predictive distribution
loss bayesian regression close loss
regression
our main result case
functions
algorithm used
bayesian methods
theorem theorem relative loss bounds
loss bayesian regression
loss regression comparison loss any function
kernel space
both bounds form
there research prove lower relative loss bounds under different loss functions
if outcomes assumed known theoretical loss given algorithm call following
not since regression also special case algorithm corresponding loss function learning rate will call algorithm algorithm following
case when outcomes not any way like our main possible prove certain loss bounds
