introduction
future network involve nodes make decisions
new less important existing well studied policy based control i e based
specifically defined at network where new call set up high between source s d
when at all between pair some existing lower need reduce their class e g simply new call
decisions lower free new call at chosen
goal whether active so total under constraints new call available free at each been described prior
example allows new core networks eg networks
also
potential applications networks
example delay class than through
proposed their importance used well networks there two significant performance complexity
performance whether result new
complexity amount information needed decision
known
complexity results large number active core network decisions need made
example if each order there would per
addition generally through multiple nodes making decisions among nodes dependent thus difficult local information
thus may require amount information perform large network decisions information active their at
then active upon new call
therefore always optimal resulting
but amount information needed at
example let total number distinct per class at new call
each two states not
total number possible states making decision
when order
then amount information at each thus requires its local information i e active at their
information available at nodes
then other nodes
however may local decisions same multiple resulting more than necessary
other words decision spatial across multiple may perform
but amount information reduced compared
example let maximum number active per
total number states at each
since compared much smaller search space decisions
therefore most algorithms literature focus see there work studies distributed decisions take into account spatial among through local information
fact distributed considered generalization
one case distributed information whereas decisions another case where size
therefore communication complexity characterized terms size
there between complexity general been shown difficult problem develop distributed algorithm whose performance within i e given error bound optimal
hence open when distributed decisions result global b how model large number dependent decision variables obtain local decisions using distributed algorithms
apply machine learning study learning machine learning view distributed individual nodes make
if each complete information all active at new will able make correct decisions
however at any given time only information active its decisions
but i e learn make decisions based those its
learn would learn what nodes only delay
all nodes would make local decisions resulting at how would machine learning distributed
problem learning decision-making been interest machine learning adaptive control but just see applications
particular using markov random general model decision-making networks
model then applied networks
our prior work obtain probabilistic models networks network properties resulting probabilistic models turn out
work distributed decisions network
view machine learning framework large number decision variables
spatial among variables key high communication complexity not been prior
machine learning provides approaches problem below global model distributed first develop probabilistic model explicitly spatial distributed decisions over new
results active their
decisions made at each also random due local information distributed
first obtain cost function potential
local decisions constraints into single
constraints include new at each
then used obtain spatial probabilistic model distribution b markov random field sufficient spatial characterized through probabilistic graph models machine learning
probabilistic graph provides simple yet representation spatial among random variables
show if decision variables optimal decision obtained local decisions through information only nodes
probabilistic model known markov random field
general distributed decisions may not markov since spatial across multiple
hence identify patterns active result spatial markov
then define distributed decisions difference between distributed decisions measured obtain sufficient conditions difference within error bound c distributed decision distributed algorithm derived based markov random field
algorithms through either sampling d issue i e distributed achieve performance complexity
here performance measures distributed decision relative optimal decision
communication complexity distributed characterized amount information used distributed decision making
distributed decisions reduce complexity using information only but may optimal performance
