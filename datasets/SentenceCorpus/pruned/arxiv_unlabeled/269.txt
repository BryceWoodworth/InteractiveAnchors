present model classification context between learning computational
model only single over data
known terms minimum problem efficient algorithm based idea core sets exists
approximate set points approximate solution corresponding instance
however multiple over data
paper based minimum data
show case learn weight vector way similar using online stochastic
our algorithm at each example requires very small constant
experimental results show even settings learn just one other online
also give analysis algorithm discuss some open possible
introduction
learning model both terms time well
scenarios common example cases network data when data at very high rate
model also cases large datasets cannot memory
standard learning algorithms do not scale well cases
address scenarios propose model learning problems
model only one small number over data set per
framework algorithms been many different domains
many problems setting since many learning problems algorithms development efficient techniques learning problems
paper study application model problem classification context
since support vector machine widely used classification framework here will further research into other
known natural terms minimum problem high space
latter problem been studied computational literature natural algorithms
algorithms classification setting provide some some open
our experiments show learn just one classification real datasets
