novel algorithm structure graph presented clear known case structure dna

graph problem related maximum maximum matching problem
algorithm variety graph types including graphs graphs nodes
resulting structure could used representation classification graphs
introduction
growth data example data about genes drug molecules proteins their functions interactions efficient mathematical algorithms tools
there large body literature subject variety theoretical computer computational
however one issue so far
given network complex interaction network how its structure first
paper data processing
let us method through description dna molecular structure way most us learned class
dna made four t g each two one among all difference between all contain components further reduced individual
way description not unique may according level but description whole structure
after years discovery who applied their natural generalization
hence structural elements also make functional sense point view } properties description applied other domains computer
result process finite set elements into novel complex objects combined turn produce next level description
rules process determined process itself
case dna above elements
they into i e according some set rules defined properties
now alternative description same object any domain knowledge context simply objects binary objects corresponding
would human along any structure present
elements without any prior knowledge size frequency
make sense data up small like protein interaction networks regulatory metabolic pathways small networks etc
our goal able approach tasks
describe paper example
will use example paper more mathematical out
graph contains structure
let us human not graph find
thus would graph into graph
graph two
first graph single graph two nodes same type
second } description data known graphs while structures described graph
paper literature field graph g

field graphs i e graph according some known graph rather than data
work related presented here due d

their e g see several
their work however not structure given graph data
rather they not only but also bound generate objects not original data
thus their approach relation here
moreover authors present negative result their algorithm just biological data use paper
another similar work application hidden markov models
there many other structure data graphs but method considered here
our method between understanding
indeed understand some phenomenon data means find some pattern structure turn could data way
work graphs some well approaches inference previously applied only
two methods particularly context sequences
also take sequence algorithms often all computer form like
%
let us algorithms many
although different all algorithms common very similar computational complexity bounds
first one all algorithms bound heuristics since finding best related complexity
heuristics turn related minimum description length principle work way described } difference how statistics used will new
some cases strategy used see eg i e will reduce size at current step other cases simple principle used any see eg
methods graph structure out several
first up different graphs
second directly approach due interactions graph
