if their true values our problem problem thus version latter
particular both problems quality algorithm characterized regret difference social between algorithm always same
investigate how design algorithms affected resulting mechanism must
find mechanisms certain strong structural properties they must they much higher regret than optimal algorithms
moreover provide mechanism our lower bound regret
introduction
recent years there been much interest understanding behavior performance algorithms whose input distributed among agents
study was main large scale interaction agents
field mechanism design studies design mechanisms computational settings see recent
much attention been search e g every second
research search focus second most used practice e g design
all rely rates at different
rates do not consider process learned over time behavior
argue agents would take process into account their utility
while prior work focused influence methods learning agents
thus consider problem search when process learning part game
between online learning
issue consider following setting natural version problem
setting there agents
each agent single value every
mechanism online algorithm first agents then
each mechanism agent using observed past feedback if there was not
after
each agent own value
assume no information known about likelihood each agent particular there no bayesian
mechanisms every agent utility any others any would been
goal social since out total value derived where total value times number
call setting behavior problem standard algorithm one alternatives associated corresponding if
problems between more information using current information choose good agent
problems been studied past three
particular above terms regret relative always same alternative
notion regret setting above total payoff being social regret being loss social relative
thus one directly compare algorithms mechanisms terms loss regret
how design algorithms affected what difference between best algorithms best mechanisms
both terms structural properties performance terms regret
not any prior work online learning algorithms negative results their performance
