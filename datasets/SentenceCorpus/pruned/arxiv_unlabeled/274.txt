robust global data methods particularly variety data occurs domains
give about clustering its properties particular focus efficient large scale data analysis
introduction
growth information biological domains data analysis data tools towards key many application scenarios
clustering data one fundamental problem data way humans
domains based methods particularly well since they represent data terms values directly humans if additional present
popular include clustering neural etc
been applied various problems domain gene expression analysis data analysis data protein sequences image analysis etc \
many popular clustering algorithms however been derived data space
applications data including temporal signals signals functional data sequential data dna sequences complex graph structures biological networks etc
often metric not appropriate compare data rather problem dependent similarity measure should used alignment correlation graph functional general
various methods towards more general data structures exist data structures functional see eg \
very general approach matrix data
way any distance measure kernel generalization might positive including settings cannot space alignment sequences empirical measurements without underlying metric
several approaches popular clustering algorithms towards setting means approaches
methods they require specific properties matrix positive they represent data terms given training points thus they cannot directly
another general approach mean field techniques way criterion does not rely use
kernel approaches main those solutions reduced
alternative representation classes i e \ set given training data
way distance data points
resulting learning problem optimization problem given set data points find points data into classes average points their
problem general special form e g \ tree there exist constant factor specific settings e g \
popular clustering optimization setting turn data points
there does not exist form given fixed search used
results complexity one clustering instead being number data points
like clustering highly
various approaches cost function different methods local much possible corresponding linear program heuristics
past years simple but neural based clustering general been proposed seen clustering include data taken into account
more clustering been into popular its been demonstrated large scale experiment
later same idea been into neural clustering together convergence clustering
like clustering methods require search obtain given fixed complexity standard one reduced see section
local widely due fast methods result robust respect noise data
numerical stability methods further they given simple they very they rely underlying cost functions extended towards setting many situations algorithm obtained demonstrated example
present about neural based clustering
present principle methods based cost functions discuss applications properties
discuss several clustering algorithms including exact methods well single large data sets
