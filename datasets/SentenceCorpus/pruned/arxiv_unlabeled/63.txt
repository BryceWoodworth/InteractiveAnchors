while been wide variety applications there relatively few theoretical convergence general graphs may many short
even provide exact
paper investigate problem using find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph weights
first probability distribution whose optimal matching then
matching also program there
not always
paper show if then always too correct answer
if then does not
provides exact performance optimization technique
also since known graphs our results other recent results using find graphs
introduction
algorithms like belief its been shown very effective many problems wide range
algorithms were designed exact inference i e probability distributions
their application general graphs involves their local rules general graph
case however there no either convergence general
understanding performance algorithms general graphs remains active research area
show graphs at most one cycle
show problems algorithm correct means upon convergence but does not always find correct
show random graphs associated
shows if then optimal relatively large
paper consider problem using find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph arbitrary weights
problem program natural
paper prove following if then always too correct answer
if then does not
were first investigate matching problem
they showed if graph then always correct answer
recently result been extended graphs
since always graphs first part our results their results correct generalization arbitrary graphs since case function structure well weights
would like point out three features our provides necessary sufficient condition arbitrary problem
there very few classes problems there performance
data dependent based not only graph structure but also weights particular instance
classes problems making terms both understanding development new algorithms
between linear been several authors exact relationship general remains
particular would investigate results relationship between
