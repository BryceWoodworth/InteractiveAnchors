introduction
paper some aspects close relationship between optimization machine learning optimization
make four primary
first mathematical
potentially provides new application domain all techniques
our second introduction sampling
new version probability approach optimization
estimation distribution algorithms entropy method special cases
however more
means those other approaches
sampling version original problem into problem
our first means apply sampling
way techniques including active learning others applied optimization
our third experimentally explore power between
experiments demonstrate improve performance sampling optimization
particular experiments show used set optimization using sampling any
some cases show results better optimization performance than any finally relationship between sample point associated values only values at sample considered algorithms end ways use techniques information sample instance bayesian sample associated values
yet another way general therefore particular
