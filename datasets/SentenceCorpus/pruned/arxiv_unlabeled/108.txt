estimate
introduction
any expression function value true
let any fixed positive define space all samples size
consider sets wide samples i e sets
will sets functions may
any fixed parameter define } words all sets corresponding binary functions wide at least
aim paper complexity class
since domain then so hence one cannot simply measure its
instead apply standard measure complexity family sets general domain class
any subset let where
growth function see instance defined measures rate number obtained finite set increases function case also called
since simple sets above then consider finite samples instead finite sample above
will define its component sets i e any given finite let use possible value
measure complexity growth function i e
