bayesian framework framework hypothesis testing parameter estimation sequence prediction classification regression
but standard statistical model class prior not always available particular complex situations
bayesian framework unique universal choice model class prior
i discuss how sense universal \ sequence prediction various problems bayesian sequence prediction
i show model many strong total future bounds bounds contrast most classical continuous prior no problem \ universal problem
even well actually better environments
introduction
given past what probability
what correct answer test sequence
given one predict
years every how likely does not
important problem forecasting sequence prediction
finding prediction rules every particular new problem possible but
what general theory prediction
bayesian framework most consistent framework developed thus far
bayesian set true data probability distribution
prior belief environment observed data sequence rule confidence
setting one directly predictive probability next without step true good useful model
section paper prediction rather than model identification
goal make predictions sense loss
note classification regression special sequence prediction problems where sequence pairs given class function value predicted
bayesian framework open how choose model class prior
general should small but large contain true environment should prior subjective belief should objective if no prior knowledge available
but bayesian framework
unique universal solution problem consider single large universal class all problems
corresponding universal prior towards simple environments way all other
leads probability probability universal machine random input program most likely prediction
many important results been universal distribution
goal paper % provide how sense universal sequence prediction all problems bayesian sequence prediction % present some recent results
% many could further developed
i future more detailed
section i review predictive performance results bayesian sequence prediction \ continuous model classes
section classical objective universal prior terms complexity
section \ section universal i show various properties universal prior class universal no problem contrast most classical continuous prior
i also general total bounds section some universal some
specific future bounds
finally i show universal mixture better than classical continuous even environments
section contains
bounds good performance environments most prior universal evidence new new universal sequence prediction
mathematical new results loss bound bounds
