local rules considered global classification rules event
global optimization algorithm used optimization quality criterion
algorithm complexity case used find all local rules
other feature algorithm integration attributes levels selection attributes rules original rules strategy
algorithm was tested number data sets comparison other predicting techniques presented
introduction
structural information data problem interest both fundamental applied studies
paper will focus one specific example problem classification
goal predict class particular event
problem was number different including statistical data analysis machine learning research data
result variety learning techniques was developed
result learning represented number different
form set rules
should some other decision models many others set rules
set rules any other form often form knowledge representation because allows simple answer question was learned
specific set rules was learned data
algorithm only answer often understand what was learned why specific answer was produced two knowledge differ case result rule learned knowledge represented than one used describe case result value learned knowledge represented same one used describe techniques developed take training data input produce set rules rules any event
techniques developed result specific event
techniques events similar given one usually found first then prediction based found made
model based instance based learning was presented
approach classification was developed result was rule specific observation
while approach simple rule answer often much understand than complex rules set often classification single event every not find best rule because algorithm may not global maximum quality criterion rule may
work approach based was developed
was used finding knowledge data each rule high degree
contrast type algorithms search algorithms find best
our early work presented approach combined rule search approach learning
work were also knowledge but only those were instance
result was set rules were classification given event
one may about rules global classification rules set given instance event
current paper approach taken next level practical algorithm variety problems presented
number significant been made since early version
current algorithm following new 1
highly allows problems significant number attributes 2
integration levels selection procedure continuous attributes rule search
information about dependent attributes directly into tree search algorithm thus significantly computational
original rules strategy was especially work generated rules
practical algorithm three aspects statistical computational complexity need
section problem discuss represent rules finding
section discuss statistical quality criterion used evaluation rule quality use work
also present rules strategy generated rules
at end section algorithm presented
section discuss selection attributes should some attributes they section not independent fact known
section discuss computational complexity approach information about attributes into algorithm proposed
section discuss error estimation
section present data analysis results compare our results results
section presented
