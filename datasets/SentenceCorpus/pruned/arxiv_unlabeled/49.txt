bound future loss when predicting any stochastic sequence online
total his universal predictor true distribution complexity
here assume at time observed
bound future prediction performance new complexity given complexity
new complexity its condition sense complexity only if condition
also discuss potential bayesian model classes classification problems
introduction
consider problem predictions
assume sequences some but unknown probability distribution
class large prior over
considered large class contains all probability distributions
showed his universal distribution i e \ predicts well any environment long probability distribution all physical theories
where length description called complexity
since they practice
see eg
also useful about prediction quality at particular time simple classes like \ sequences data size where accuracy typically
bounds expected total loss e g \ number prediction errors derived often sufficient online setting
bounds terms complexity
instance number errors sense measures case information observed sequence
paper assume at time observed
hence future prediction performance since typically about past errors
if total loss finite future loss must small large
sense paper
if complexity bounds total loss natural like complexity given bounds future loss if contains even all information about should make no errors indeed prove two bounds but additional terms structural properties
additional terms appear since total loss only hence future loss small only
first bound theorem additional term complexity length estimation
second bound theorem additional term complexity
advantage small average contrast length
but case complexity out
so introduce new natural complexity function condition
require consistent sense if program some given then must generate same given any
new bounds also significantly improve upon previous total bounds
paper follows
some basic given
section prove discuss bound theorem
section show why new complexity necessary bound theorem
discuss basic properties new complexity section prove theorem section
discuss potential general model classes classification section
