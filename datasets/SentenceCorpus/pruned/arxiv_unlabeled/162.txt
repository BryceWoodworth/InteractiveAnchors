how likely useful application
because same different should features same
important because whether combined further processing at rate
three described paper
first present new heuristic feature detection using machine learning derive feature process using less than available processing time
comparison most other cannot even at rate
second little loss
third out comparison based above criterion applied
show despite being tests our heuristic significantly existing feature
finally comparison using machine learning significant both very fast very high quality
introduction
detection used first step many tasks image matching recognition
need development large number
however despite increase power since still true when processing at full rate existing feature little if any time further processing
applications described above typically into database thus important same points multiple
amount variation under condition should depends application
