introduction
techniques machine learning statistics numerical analysis signal processing
given matrix its associated most significant underlying data source
approximation further used number linear algorithms
many practical only sparse subset matrix
recently been if matrix rank too small random subset its allow
result was first convex introduced
analysis same convex was out
number solve convex optimization problem
alternative work same problem using combination techniques will their algorithm low complexity most complex being values corresponding vectors sparse matrix
performance information lower random needed here assume order
related approach was also developed although without performance matrix
above results rely assumption rank matrix
many applications interest assumption therefore important investigate their robustness
above approaches when underlying data rank matrix
question was within convex approach
present paper similar robustness result
obtain variety improve over results
