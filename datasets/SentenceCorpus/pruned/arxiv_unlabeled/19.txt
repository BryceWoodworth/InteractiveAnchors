recent et al obtained first algorithm under distribution
they showed random noise sensitivity models
their results several
first show natural class cannot learned noise sensitivity model using only statistical
contrast show version random model allows learn
also algorithm et al case natural generalization
introduction
learning normal form been central problem computational learning theory literature since paper learning
was shown learned using form active learning
algorithm also known uses combination two fundamental techniques learning analysis
use analysis study functions was introduced
was used basis learning algorithm
analysis used algorithm based algorithm was first applied learning problem
hypothesis technique reduce classification error learning algorithm was introduced
algorithm used actually due
recent et al obtained first learning algorithm
their algorithm based
called was first obtained
was used learn under distribution two natural learning models
first one random model where examples instead being random see also related work
second model related noise sensitivity model where time examples pairs second instance being version first one
results they give learning algorithm case where no control over examples provided
however problem learning under distribution when examples
still remains open
known cannot learned more statistical model introduced where one only about statistics over random examples
also showed class decision only increase size extended his algorithm case generalization where
whether those classes functions learned random noise sensitivity models was open
our
first show cannot learned noise sensitivity model using statistical
far know first example negative result statistical i e pairs examples
does not rule out learning random model although provides evidence techniques cannot extended case
other hand show simple random model where component fixed cycle allows learn
seems first model respect distribution
actually one perform random model also show model than active setting under standard assumption
finally techniques domain use learn noise sensitivity random models
result out rather case found
section introduce learning models give review analysis
negative result learning derived section
learning algorithms presented
