learning apply method recent global optimization algorithm
learned better than policy average human
argue learning because i policy space combination individual actions thus search towards low complexity solutions found if they exist
based new theoretical framework found
introduction
during two learning state been
large variety algorithms including based direct policy search methods
basic properties many algorithms relatively well e g conditions convergence complexity effect various parameters etc although there still important open questions
there also test problems like various tasks etc algorithms been demonstrated number applications also
however there still need more applications place major
games including set classical games games computer games etc test environments learning
games human therefore they means explore what still
furthermore most games well into they sequential decision problems where each decision effect
many cases hidden information random events unknown environment known unknown account part difficulty game
focus learning idea
they also testing new decision space most cases so finding good strategy task
there another advantage games test rules games fixed so task i e rules environment so they proposed algorithm reduced compared eg various tasks
been many classical games including
other hand computer games into only recently there not very many learn them tools
eg game strategy game
games also point view they different aspects human instead wide most computer games need strategies but many observations considered both observation space action space
investigate game
game its own but also several important questions will section
will show approach more than either learning strategy
will provide actions observations task learn how them into good policy
will apply because they include human
learning will apply method recently developed general optimization algorithm
next section game related literature
also investigate questions upon game learning task
give short description optimization method
section describe learning experiments section present our results
finally section discuss our approach its other problems
