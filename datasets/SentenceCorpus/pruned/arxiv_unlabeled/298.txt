introduction
detection involves significant test data distribution
applications distribution unknown generally cannot estimated training data due combination factors limited data size high
propose adaptive method detection based functions data samples
our function derived graph point data
test sample below error
our method upon its close
statistical hypothesis testing any feature space distribution data
when test samples smaller than error less than
develop novel notion based measures level sets likelihood functions
our notion provides optimal most level case when density mixture known density
show our function consistent our data length approaches
detection been studied
also detection detection classification classification literature
approaches detection into several
approaches assumed family likelihood tests used
difficult use approaches when distribution unknown data limited
detection approach presented
there distance test sample threshold
comparison our global information available graph
addition properties
learning approaches find decision regions based data their
include et
al
where basic idea training data into kernel space them maximum
other algorithms along research include support vector data description linear approach single class probability machine
while approaches provide efficient solutions real data generally difficult parameter choices probability
derive decision regions based minimum sets does provide type i type error control
they approximate appropriate function classes level sets unknown density training samples
related work based comparing test samples most subset points training sample
most set point minimum point data minimum entropy set also set
point data generally
computational heuristic algorithms based out graph while algorithm no optimal
our approach related latter techniques sets approach
develop functions turn out empirical estimates sets test point
real number sufficient optimal
way level set
yet our algorithms lead optimal solutions ability control error probabilities
main features our 1 like our algorithm scales dimension data size applied high feature spaces 2 like our algorithm optimal most level case density mixture any other density not do not require assumptions level sets
furthermore our algorithm structure local density like other learning approaches do not require complex parameters function approximation classes
