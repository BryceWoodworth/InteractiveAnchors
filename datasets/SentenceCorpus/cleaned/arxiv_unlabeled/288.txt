 
suppose signal realized driving sparse signal through arbitrary unknown stable discrete-linear time invariant system  namely  where impulse response operator
types processes arise naturally reflection seismology
paper interested several problems: blind-deconvolution: recover both filter sparse signal noisy measurements b compressive sensing: compressible conventional sense compressed sensing
namely reconstructed sparse set measurements
develop novel minimization methods solve both cases establish sufficient conditions exact recovery case when unknown system auto-regressive i e all pole known order
compressed sensing/sampling setting turns out both reconstructed measurements under certain technical conditions support structure
our main idea pass through linear time invariant system collect sequential measurements
filter chosen suitably namely its associated toeplitz matrix satisfies rip property
develop novel lp optimization algorithm show both unknown filter sparse input reliably estimated
