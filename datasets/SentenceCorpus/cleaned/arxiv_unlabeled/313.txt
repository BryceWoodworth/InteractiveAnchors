 introduction 
many enterprises employ chief information security officer~(ciso manage enterprise's information security risks
typically enterprise many more security vulnerabilities than realistically repair
instead declaring enterprise ``insecure'' until every last vulnerability plugged cisos typically perform cost-benefit analysis identify risks address but what constitutes effective ciso strategy
conventional wisdom cisos ought adopt ``forward-looking'' proactive approach mitigating security risk examining enterprise vulnerabilities might exploited future
advocates proactive security often equate reactive security myopic bug-chasing consider ineffective
establish sufficient conditions when reacting strategically attacks effective discouraging attackers
study efficacy reactive strategies economic model ciso's security cost-benefit trade-offs
unlike previously proposed economic models security see section do not assume attacker acts according fixed probability distribution
instead consider game-theoretic model strategic attacker who responds defender's strategy
standard security literature make worst-case assumptions about attacker
example grant attacker complete knowledge defender's strategy do not require attacker act rationally
further make conservative assumptions about reactive defender's knowledge do not assume defender knows all vulnerabilities system attacker's incentives
however do assume defender observe attacker's past actions example via intrusion detection system user metrics
our model find two properties sufficient reactive strategy perform well best proactive strategies
first no single attack catastrophic meaning defender survive number attacks
consistent situations where intrusions say steal credit card numbers regrettable but not business-ending
second defender's budget \term{liquid} meaning defender re-allocate resources without penalty
example ciso reassign members security team managing firewall rules improving database access controls at relatively low switching costs
because our model abstracts many vulnerabilities into single graph edge view act defense increasing attacker's \term{cost} mounting attack instead preventing attack e g  patching single bug
making assumption choose not study tactical patch-by-patch interaction attacker defender
instead model enterprise security at more level appropriate ciso
example ciso might allocate portion his her budget engage consultancy whitehat isec partners find fix cross-site scripting particular web application require employees use securid tokens during authentication
make technical assumption attacker costs linearly dependent defense investments locally
assumption does not reflect patch-by-patch interaction would better represented step function step placed at cost deploy patch
instead assumption reflects ciso's higher-level viewpoint where staircase summed step functions fades into slope
evaluate defender's strategy measuring attacker's cumulative return-on-investment \term{return-on-attack}~(roa been proposed previously
studying metric focus defenders who seek ``cut off attacker's oxygen,'' reduce attacker's incentives attacking enterprise
do not distinguish between ``successful'' ``unsuccessful'' attacks
instead compare payoff attacker receives his her nefarious deeds cost performing said deeds
imagine sufficiently disincentivized attackers will seek alternatives attacking different organization starting legitimate business
our main result show sufficient conditions learning-based reactive strategy competitive best fixed proactive defense sense competitive ratio between reactive roa proactive roa at most  all  provided game lasts sufficiently many rounds at least 
prove our theorems draw techniques online learning literature
extend techniques case where learner does not know all game matrix rows priori  letting us analyze situations where defender does not know all vulnerabilities advance
although our main results graph-based model single attacker our results generalize model based horn clauses multiple attackers
our results also robust switching roa attacker profit allowing proactive defender revise defense allocation fixed number times
although myopic bug chasing most likely ineffective reactive strategy find some situations strategic reactive strategy effective optimal fixed proactive defense
fact find natural strategy gradually reinforcing attacked edges shifting budget unattacked edges ``learns'' attacker's incentives constructs effective defense
strategic reactive strategy both easier implement than proactive strategy---because does not presume defender knows attacker's intent capabilities---and less wasteful than proactive strategy because defender does not expend budget attacks do not actually occur
