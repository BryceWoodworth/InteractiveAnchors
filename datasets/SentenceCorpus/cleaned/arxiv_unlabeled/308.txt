natural measure adaptation obtained kullback-leibler kl divergence between i/o distribution true world i/o distribution expected agent uncertain about possible worlds
case pure input streams bayesian mixture provides well-known solution problem

 introduction 
ability adapt unknown environments often considered hallmark intelligence
agent environment conceptualized two systems exchange symbols every time step : issued agent action whereas issued environment observation
thus both agent environment conceptualized probability distributions over sequences actions observations i/o streams
if environment perfectly known then i/o probability distribution agent tailored suit particular environment
however if environment unknown but known belong set possible environments then agent faces adaptation problem
consider example robot been endowed set behavioral primitives now faces problem how act while being ignorant correct primitive
since want model both agent environment probability distributions over i/o sequences natural way measure degree adaptation would measure `distance' probability space between i/o distribution represented agent i/o distribution conditioned true environment
suitable measure terms its information-theoretic interpretation readily provided kl-divergence
case passive prediction adaptation problem well-known solution
distribution minimizes kl-divergence bayesian mixture distribution over all possible environments
aim paper extend result distributions over both inputs outputs
main result paper extension only possible if consider special syntax actions probability theory been suggested proponents causal calculus
