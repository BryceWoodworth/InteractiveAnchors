 introduction 
problem calculating permanent non-negative matrix arises many contexts
statistics data analysis physics
example intrinsic parameter learning flow
used follow particles turbulence cross-correlate two subsequent images

however problem hard  meaning solving
time polynomial system size  unlikely
therefore when size matrix sufficiently large one naturally looks ways approximate
permanent
very significant breakthrough was achieved invention so-called
fully-polynomial-randomized algorithmic schemes fpras permanent problem :
permanent approximated polynomial time
high probability within arbitrarily small relative error
however complexity fpras  making impractical majority realistic applications
motivates task finding lighter deterministic probabilistic algorithm capable
evaluating permanent more efficiently
paper continues thread  where belief propagation bp algorithm was suggested efficient heuristic good but not absolute quality approximate permanent
bp family algorithms
originally introduced context error-correction codes artificial
intelligence  generally stated any graphical model

efficient heuristic evaluating partition function finding maximum

however
general loopy cases one would normally not expect bp work well thus making heuristic results somehow surprising
even though not completely unexpected view existence polynomially efficient algorithms ml version problem 
also realized via iterative bp algorithm
raises questions understanding performance bp: what
does well what misses
also motivates challenge improving bp
heuristics
