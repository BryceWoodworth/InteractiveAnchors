example counting th frequency moment  streaming signal where denotes time been active area research theoretical computer science databases data mining
when  task i e  counting sum accomplished using counter
when  however becomes non-trivial design small space i e  low memory counting system
compressed counting cc proposed efficiently computing th frequency moment data stream  where
cc applicable if streaming data follow turnstile model restriction at time evaluation  includes strict turnstile model special case
data streams practice restriction minor
underlying technique skewed stable random projections  captures intuition when simple counter suffices when small  sample complexity should low continuously function 
show sample complexity number projections {symbol } where {symbol } {symbol }
other words small  instead
case practically very important
now well-understood one obtain good approximations entropies data streams using th moments very small
statistical inference using method moments  sometimes reasonable use th moments very close 1
another example might ``decay rate'' ``interest rate,'' usually small
thus compressed counting will ideal tool estimating total value future taking account effect decaying interest accruement
finally our another contribution algorithm approximating logarithmic norm {symbol } logarithmic distance {symbol }
logarithmic norm arises statistical estimations
logarithmic distance useful machine learning practice heavy-tailed data
 introduction 
paper % } focuses counting  among most fundamental operations almost every field science engineering
computing sum {symbol } simplest counting  denotes time
counting {symbol th moment } more general
when {symbol  } counts total number non-zeros
when {symbol  } counts ``energy'' ``power'' signal
if actually outputs power underlying signal  counting sum {symbol } equivalent computing {symbol }
here denotes time-varying signal example data streams
literature th frequency moment data stream defined {} counting massive data streams practically important among many challenging issues data stream computations
fact general theme ``scaling up high dimensional data high speed data streams'' among ``ten challenging problems data mining research
''%} because elements  time-varying na\'ive counting mechanism requires system counters compute exactly
not always realistic when large only need approximate answer
example may if records arrivals ip addresses
total number checking/savings accounts
compressed counting cc new scheme approximating th frequency moments data streams where  using low memory
underlying technique based what call skewed stable random projections
