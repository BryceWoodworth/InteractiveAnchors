 introduction 
typical result competitive on-line prediction says given benchmark class prediction strategies there prediction strategy performs almost well best prediction strategies benchmark class
simplicity paper performance prediction strategy will measured cumulative squared distance between its predictions true observations assumed real occasionally complex numbers
different methods competitive on-line predictions gradient descent following perturbed leader strong weak aggregating algorithms defensive forecasting etc \ tend their narrow ``area expertise'': each works well benchmark classes specific ``size'' but not readily applicable classes different size
paper will apply simple general method based metric entropy benchmark classes wide range sizes
typically method does not give optimal results but its results often not much worse than those given specialized methods especially benchmark classes not too massive
since method almost universally applicable sheds new light known results
another disadvantage metric entropy method not clear how implement efficiently whereas many other methods computationally very efficient
therefore results obtained method only first step should looking other prediction strategies both computationally more efficient having better performance guarantees
start \s stating simple asymptotic result about existence universal prediction strategy class continuous prediction rules
performance universal strategy long run good performance any continuous prediction rule but do not attempt estimate rate at former approaches latter
topic following section \s where establish general results about performance guarantees based metric entropy
example simplest case where benchmark class compact set performance guarantees become weaker metric entropy becomes larger
core paper organized according types metric compacts pointed out kolmogorov tikhomirov \s3
type i compacts metric entropy order ; case corresponds finite-dimensional benchmark classes treated \s
type ii typical order  contains various classes analytic functions dealt \s
key deals perhaps most important case order ; includes eg  besov classes
classes type iv considered \s metric entropy grows even faster
\s\s benchmark class always given
ask question how prediction strategies competitive against various benchmark classes compare each other
previous section \s prepares ground \iffullin standard methods used deduce implications results preceding sections statistical learning theory \blueendthe concluding section \s lists several directions further research
there no real novelty paper; i just apply known results about metric entropy competitive on-line prediction
i hope will useful survey
