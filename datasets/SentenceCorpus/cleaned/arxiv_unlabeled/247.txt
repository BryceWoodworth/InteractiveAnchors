 introduction 
spectral techniques authentic workhorse machine learning statistics numerical analysis signal processing
given matrix  its largest singular values---and associated singular vectors---`explain' most significant correlations underlying data source
low-rank approximation further used low-complexity implementations number linear algebra algorithms
many practical circumstances access only sparse subset entries matrix
recently been discovered if matrix rank  unless too `structured' small random subset its entries allow reconstruct exactly
result was first proved analyzing convex relaxation introduced
tighter analysis same convex relaxation was carried out
number iterative schemes solve convex optimization problem appeared soon thereafter
alternative line work attacked same problem using combination spectral techniques manifold optimization: will refer their algorithm \optspace \optspace\ intrinsically low complexity most complex operation being computing singular values corresponding singular vectors sparse matrix
performance guarantees proved comparable information theoretic lower bound: roughly random entries needed reconstruct exactly here assume order 
related approach was also developed  although without performance guarantees matrix completion
above results crucially rely assumption exactly rank matrix
many applications interest assumption unrealistic therefore important investigate their robustness
above approaches generalized when underlying data `well approximated' rank matrix
question was addressed within convex relaxation approach
present paper proves similar robustness result \optspace
remarkably guarantees obtain order-optimal variety circumstances improve over analogous results
