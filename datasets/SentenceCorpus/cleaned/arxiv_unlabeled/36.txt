 
introduce simple framework learning aggressive maneuvers flight control uavs
having inspired biological environment dynamic movement primitives analyzed extended using nonlinear contraction theory
accordingly primitives observed movement stably combined concatenated
demonstrate our results experimentally quanser helicopter first imitate aggressive maneuvers then use them primitives achieve new maneuvers fly over obstacle
 introduction 
role uavs unmanned aerial vehicles gained significant importance last decades
they many advantages agility low surface area ability work constrained dangerous places over their conventional precedents
addition current uavs more biologically-inspired terms shape performance because improvements electronics propulsion
unfortunately still far away using their capacity at fullest
mostly related weakness current control algorithms against high-dimensional nonlinear environments
sense generating aggressive maneuvers interesting hard accomplish
paper our approach solve issue designed view experiments frogs monkeys suggest faced inverse-kinematics algorithm adapts environment changes sequence target points irrespective initial conditions
theory analyzed dynamic movement primitives dmps combined them using contraction theory
experiments obstacle avoidance dmp human-piloted flight data segmented into parts combined at different initial points achieve maneuvers against different obstacles different locations
background our work briefly detailed below
