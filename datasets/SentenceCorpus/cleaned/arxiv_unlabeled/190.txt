here consider minimal models two types learning algorithms: cross-situational learning individuals determine meaning word looking something common across all observed uses word supervised operant conditioning learning there strong feedback between individuals about intended meaning words

 introduction 
how coherent lexicon emerge group interacting agents major open issue language evolution acquisition research area hurford 1989; nowak \& krakauer 1999; steels 2002; kirby 2002; smith kirby \& brighton 2003
addition dynamics self-organization shared lexicons one issues computational mathematical modeling contribute most emergence lexicon scratch implies some type self-organization possibly threshold phenomenon
cannot completely understood without thorough exploration parameter space models baronchelli felici loreto caglioli \& steels 2006
there two main research avenues investigate emergence bootstrapping lexicon
first approach inspired seminal work pinker bloom 1990 who argued natural selection main design principle explain emergence complex structure language resorts evolutionary algorithms evolve shared lexicon
key element here improvement communication ability individual results average increase number offspring produces hurford 1989; nowak \& krakauer 1999; cangelosi 2001; fontanari \& perlovsky 2007 2008
second research avenue will follow paper argues culturally based view language evolution so assumes lexicons acquired modified solely through learning during individual's lifetime steels 2002; smith kirby \& brighton 2003
course if there fact about language uncontroversial lexicon must learned active passive interaction between children language-proficient adults
issue whether ability learn lexicon due some domain-general learning mechanism innate ability unique humans still table bates \& elman 1996
problem address here there simply no language-proficient individuals so not so far-fetched put forward biological rather than cultural explanation emergence self-organized lexicon
nevertheless contribution will use many insights produced research language acquisition children see eg  gleitman 1990; bloom 2000 study different learning strategies
developmental perspective there basically two competing schemes lexicon acquisition children rosenthal \& zimmerman 1978
first scheme termed cross-situational observational learning based intuitive idea one way learner determine meaning word find something common across all observed uses word pinker 1984; gleitman 1990; siskind 1996
hence learning takes place through statistical sampling contexts word appears
since learner receives no feedback about its inferences refer scheme unsupervised learning
second scheme known generally operant conditioning involves active participation agents learning process exchange non-linguistic cues provide feedback hearer inferences
supervised learning scheme been applied design system communication autonomous robots  so-called language game talking heads experiments steels 2003
despite technological appeal empirical evidence most part lexicon acquired children product unsupervised learning pinker 1984; gleitman 1990; bloom 2000
interestingly perspective evolving bootstrapping lexicon unsupervised scheme very attractive too since eliminates altogether issue honest signaling dawkins \& krebs 1978 no signaling involved learning process requires only observation some elements intuitive psychology e g theory mind
many different computational implementations variants two schemes bootstrapping lexicon been proposed literature
example smith 2003a 2003b smith smith blythe \& vogt 2006 de beule de vylder \& belpaeme 2006 addressed unsupervised learning scheme whereas steels \& kaplan 1999 ke minett au wang 2002 smith kirby \& brighton 2003 lenaerts jansen tuyls \& de vylder 2005 supervised scheme
however except extensive statistical analysis variant supervised learning algorithm reduces problem naming single object baronchelli felici loreto caglioli \& steels 2006 study effects changing parameters those models been usually limited display time evolution some measure communication accuracy population
although at first sight supervised learning scheme may seem clearly superior unsupervised one albeit less realistic context language acquisition children not aware any thorough comparison between performances two learning scenarios
fact contribution show realistic limit very large lexicon sizes supervised unsupervised learning performances essentially identical
paper study minimal models supervised unsupervised learning schemes preserve main ingredients two classical language acquisition paradigms
sake simplicity here interpret lexicon mapping between objects words sounds rather than mapping between meanings conceptual structures sounds
more complete scenario would involve first creation meanings i e  bootstrapping object-meaning mapping steels 1996; fontanari 2006 then emergence meaning-sound mapping see eg  smith 2003a 2003b; fontanari \& perlovsky 2006
