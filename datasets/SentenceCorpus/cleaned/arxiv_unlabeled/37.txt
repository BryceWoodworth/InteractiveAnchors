ce works rather good when dealing deterministic function optimization
now appears two conditions needed good convergence method

indirectly appears also function optimized should deterministic

 introduction 
cross-entropy method been developed r
rubinstein simulation rare events
algorithm iteratively builds near-optimal importance sampling rare event based family parameterized sampling laws
construction importance sampling obtained iteratively: tossing samples selecting samples approximating rare events relearning parameters sampling law minimizing its kulback-leiber distance cross-entropy selection computing importance weightings
considering optimal events related objective rare events method been extended optimization problems \\[5pt cross-entropy method been implemented successfully many combinatorial problems
however attempted proofs method make some assumptions preliminary requests
first proof been made deterministic context
secondly closure simulation law family should contain dirac optimum laws support optimums \\[5pt first condition cannot fulfilled properly case stochastic problem
second condition obvious requirement
but there some cases where not possible handle all solutions precisely law family
indeed solutions may not countable practically; typically case some dynamic problems example strategy tree against deterministic computer chess player
both difficulties encountered optimal planning partial observation
purpose paper point out simple examples hypotheses necessary convergence classical ce method
questions are: does \emph{classical ce algorithm solve stochastic problems properly } appears quantile selection within ce may not work properly without rather good estimation objective functional expectation
nevertheless smoother selection criteria seem possible answer difficulties
assume law family closure does not contain all deterministic solutions
ce algorithm will converge stochastic approximation optimal solution
approximation best possible within law family
our answer question not absolutely negative
but appears some extensions ce quite usually implemented will fail question
paper presents some counterexamples questions
case stochastic optimization tests done simple random examples order compare convergence various ce methods global optimum \\[5pt next section introduces shortly principle ce method
section will consider case where optimal solution not caught properly sampling family
counterexample proposed studied
section stochastic problems considered
two simple counterexamples investigated thus enlightening some typical convergence difficulties
different evolutions cross-entropy then compared basical method generating several random examples
particular method smooth sample selection proposed possible alternative stochastic problems
section concludes
