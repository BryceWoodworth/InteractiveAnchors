 
recent years spectral clustering become one most popular modern clustering algorithms
simple implement solved efficiently standard linear algebra software very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms k-means algorithm
first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious not obvious see why works at all what really does
goal tutorial give some intuition those questions
describe different graph laplacians their basic properties present most common spectral clustering algorithms derive those algorithms scratch several different approaches
advantages disadvantages different spectral clustering algorithms discussed
 introduction 
clustering one most widely used techniques exploratory data analysis applications ranging statistics computer science biology social sciences psychology
virtually every scientific field dealing empirical data people attempt get first impression their data trying identify groups ``similar behavior'' their data
article would like introduce reader family spectral clustering algorithms
compared ``traditional algorithms'' means single linkage spectral clustering many fundamental advantages
results obtained spectral clustering often outperform traditional approaches spectral clustering very simple implement solved efficiently standard linear algebra methods \\ tutorial set up self-contained introduction spectral clustering
derive spectral clustering scratch present different points view why spectral clustering works
apart basic linear algebra no particular mathematical background required reader
however do not attempt give concise review whole literature spectral clustering impossible due overwhelming amount literature subject
first two sections devoted step-by-step introduction mathematical objects used spectral clustering: similarity graphs section  graph laplacians section
spectral clustering algorithms themselves will presented section
next three sections then devoted explaining why those algorithms work
each section corresponds one explanation: section describes graph partitioning approach section random walk perspective section perturbation theory approach
section will study some practical issues related spectral clustering discuss various extensions literature related spectral clustering section
