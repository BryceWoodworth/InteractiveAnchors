our test statistic largest difference expectations over functions unit ball reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs
present two tests based large deviation bounds test statistic while third based asymptotic distribution statistic
test statistic computed quadratic time although efficient linear time approximations available
several classical metrics distributions recovered when function space used compute difference expectations allowed more general eg banach space
apply our two-sample tests variety problems including attribute matching databases using hungarian marriage method where they perform strongly
excellent performance also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs first tests
 introduction 
address problem comparing samples two probability distributions proposing statistical tests hypothesis distributions different called two-sample homogeneity problem
tests application variety areas
bioinformatics interest compare microarray data identical tissue types measured different laboratories detect whether data may analysed jointly whether differences experimental procedure caused systematic differences data distributions
equally interest comparisons between microarray data different tissue types either determine whether two subtypes cancer may treated statistically indistinguishable diagnosis perspective detect differences healthy cancerous tissue
database attribute matching desirable merge databases containing multiple fields where not known advance fields correspond: fields matched maximising similarity distributions their entries
test whether distributions different basis samples drawn each them finding well behaved e g \ smooth function large points drawn  small negative possible points
use our test statistic difference between mean function values two samples; when large samples likely different distributions
call statistic maximum mean discrepancy mmd
clearly quality mmd statistic depends class smooth functions define
one hand must ``rich enough'' so population mmd vanishes if only if
other hand test consistent needs ``restrictive'' enough empirical estimate mmd converge quickly its expectation sample size increases
shall use unit balls universal reproducing kernel hilbert spaces our function classes since will shown satisfy both foregoing properties also review classical metrics distributions namely kolmogorov-smirnov earth-mover's distances based different function classes
more practical note mmd reasonable computational cost when compared other two-sample tests: given points sampled  cost time
also propose less statistically efficient algorithm computational cost  yield superior performance at given computational cost looking at larger volume data
define three non-parametric statistical tests based mmd
first two use distribution-independent uniform convergence bounds provide finite sample guarantees test performance at expense being conservative detecting differences between
third test based asymptotic distribution mmd practice more sensitive differences distribution at small sample sizes
present work synthesizes expands results   who turn build earlier work
note latter addresses only third kind test approach employs more accurate approximation asymptotic distribution test statistic
begin our presentation section formal definition mmd proof population mmd zero if only if when unit ball universal rkhs
also review alternative function classes mmd defines metric probability distributions
section  give overview hypothesis testing applies two-sample problem review other approaches problem
present our first two hypothesis tests section  based two different bounds deviation between population empirical
take different approach section  where use asymptotic distribution empirical estimate basis third test
when large volumes data available cost computing mmd quadratic sample size may excessive: therefore propose section modified version mmd statistic linear cost number samples associated asymptotic test
section  provide overview methods related mmd statistics machine learning literature
finally section  demonstrate performance mmd-based two-sample tests problems neuroscience bioinformatics attribute matching using hungarian marriage method
our approach performs well high dimensional data low sample size; addition able successfully distinguish distributions graph data ours first proposed test
