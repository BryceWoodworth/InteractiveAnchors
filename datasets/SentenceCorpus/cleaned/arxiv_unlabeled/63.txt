while been successfully employed wide variety applications there relatively few theoretical guarantees convergence correctness general loopy graphs may many short cycles
even fewer provide exact ``necessary sufficient'' characterizations
paper investigate problem using max-product find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph edge weights
done first constructing probability distribution whose mode corresponds optimal matching then running max-product
weighted matching also posed integer program there lp relaxation
relaxation not always tight
paper show if lp relaxation tight then max-product always converges too correct answer
if lp relaxation loose then max-product does not converge
provides exact data-dependent characterization max-product performance precise connection lp relaxation well-studied optimization technique
also since lp relaxation known tight bipartite graphs our results generalize other recent results using max-product find weighted matchings bipartite graphs
 introduction 
message-passing algorithms like belief propagation its variants generalizations been shown empirically very effective solving many instances hard/computationally intensive problems wide range fields
algorithms were originally designed exact inference i e calculation marginals/max-marginals tree-structured probability distributions
their application general graphs involves replicating their iterative local update rules general graph
case however there no guarantees either convergence correctness general
understanding characterizing performance message-passing algorithms general graphs remains active research area
show correctness graphs at most one cycle
show gaussian problems sum-product algorithm finds correct means upon convergence but does not always find correct variances
show asymptotic correctness random graphs associated decoding
shows if max-product converges then optimal relatively large ``local'' neighborhood
paper consider problem using max-product find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph arbitrary edge weights
problem formulated integer program natural lp relaxation
paper prove following if lp relaxation tight then max-product always converges too correct answer
if lp relaxation loose then max-product does not converge
bayati shah sharma were first investigate max-product weighted matching problem
they showed if graph bipartite then max-product always converges correct answer
recently result been extended matchings bipartite graphs
since lp relaxation always tight bipartite graphs first part our results recover their results viewed correct generalization arbitrary graphs since case tightness function structure well weights
would like point out three features our work: provides necessary sufficient condition convergnce max-product arbitrary problem instances
there very few non-trivial classes problems there tight characterization message-passing performance
characterization data dependent : decided based not only graph structure but also weights particular instance
tightness lp relaxations well-studied broad classes problems making chracterization promising terms both understanding development new algorithms
relations similarities comparisons between max-product linear programming been used/mentioned several authors  exact characterization relationship general remains interesting endeavor
particular would interesting investigate implications results regards elucidating relationship between iterative decoding channel codes lp decoding
