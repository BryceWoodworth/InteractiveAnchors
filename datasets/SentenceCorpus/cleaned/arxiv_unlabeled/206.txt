 
collecting large labeled data sets laborious expensive task whose scaling up requires division labeling workload between many teachers
when number classes large miscorrespondences between labels given different teachers likely occur extreme case may reach total inconsistency
study describe how globally consistent labels obtained despite absence teacher coordination discuss possible efficiency process terms human labor
define notion label efficiency measuring ratio between number globally consistent labels obtained number labels provided distributed teachers
show efficiency depends critically ratio between number data instances seen single teacher number classes
suggest several algorithms distributed labeling problem analyze their efficiency function
addition provide upper bound label efficiency case completely uncoordinated teachers show efficiency approaches ratio between number labels each teacher provides number classes drops i e 
 introduction 
applications machine learning mature larger training sets required both terms number training instances number classes considered
recent years witnessed trend example vision related tasks object class recognition detection
specifically object class recognition current data sets caltech-256 include tens thousands images hundreds classes
collecting consistent data sets size intensive expensive task
scaling up naturally leads distributed labeling scenario labels provided large number weakly coordinated teachers
example label-me system labels contributed dozens researchers while esp game labels supplied thousands uncoordinated players
turn toward distributed labeling several practical considerations emerge may disrupt data integrity
general while reasonable believe single teacher relatively self-consistent though not completely error-free not case multiple uncoordinated teachers
different teachers may differences their labeling systems due several causes
first different teachers may use different words describe same item class
example one teacher may use word ``truck'' while other uses ``lorry'' describe same class
conversely same word may used two teachers describe two totally different classes hence one teacher may use ``greyhound'' describe breed dog while other uses describe c-2 navy aircraft
similar problems occur when different teachers label data different abstraction levels so one generalizes over all dogs while other discriminates between poodle labrador etc
finally teachers often do not agree exact demarcation concepts so chair carved stone may labeled ``chair'' one teacher while other describes ``a rock''
all phenomena become increasingly pronounced number classes increased thus their neglect essentially leads severe decrease label purity consequently learning performance
paper study cost obtaining globally consistent labels while focusing specific distributed labeling scenario only some difficulties described above present
enforce distributed nature problem assume large data set examples labeled set uncoordinated teachers where each teacher agrees label at most data points
while there one-to-one correspondence between classes used different teachers assume their labeling systems entirely uncoordinated so class labeled ``duck'' one teacher may labeled ``goat'' another
later stages paper relax assumption consider case partial consistency exists between different teachers
both scenarios realistic various problem domains
consider example security system label large set face images including thousands different people
since teachers not familiar persons labeled names they give classes entirely un-coordinated
case partial consistency exemplified distributed labeling flower images: layman easily distinguish between many different kinds flowers but name only few
difficulties ``one-to-many'' label correspondence between teachers concept demarcation disagreements not met our current analysis focuses preliminary difficulties distributed labeling
another related scenario our analysis extended relatively easily case initial data labeled uncoordinated teachers right start
consider example task unifying images labeled site like flickr% into meaningful large training data set
our suggested algorithms analysis apply case minor modifications
