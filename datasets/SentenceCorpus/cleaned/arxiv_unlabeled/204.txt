 introduction 
support vector machines svm now routinely used many classification problems machine learning due their ease use ability generalize
basic case input data corresponding two groups mapped into higher dimensional space where maximum-margin hyperplane computed separate them
``kernel trick'' used ensure mapping into higher dimensional space never explicitly calculated
formulated non-negative quadratic programming nqp problem there efficient algorithms solve
svm trained using variants gradient descent method applied nqp
although methods quite efficient  their drawback requirement setting learning rate
subset selection methods alternative approach solving svm nqp problem
at high level they work splitting arguments quadratic function at each iteration into two sets: fixed set where arguments held constant working set variables being optimized current iteration
methods  though efficient space time still require heuristic exchange arguments between working fixed sets
alternative algorithm solving general nqp problem been applied svm
algorithm called m\textsuperscript{3} uses multiplicative updates iteratively converge solution
does not require any heuristics setting learning rate choosing how split argument set
paper reformulate dual svm problem demonstrate connection non-negative matrix factorization nmf algorithm
nmf employs multiplicative updates very successful practice due its independence learning rate parameter low computational complexity ease implementation
new formulation allows us devise multiplicative updates solving svm non-negative kernels output value kernel function greater equal zero
requirement non-negative kernel not very restrictive since their set includes many popular kernels gaussian polynomial even degree etc
new updates possess all good properties nmf algorithm independence hyper-parameters low computational complexity ease implementation
furthermore new algorithm converges faster than previous multiplicative solution svm problem both asymptotically proof provided practice
also show how solve svm problem soft margin using new algorithm
