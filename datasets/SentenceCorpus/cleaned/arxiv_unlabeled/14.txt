our aim investigate conditions existence function class algorithms examplified initial "k-means" kohonen algorithms
results presented here supplement previous studies including   
our work shows energy function not always potential but at least uniform limit series potential functions call pseudo-potential
also shows large number existing vector quantization algorithms developed artificial neural networks community fall into category
framework define opens way study convergence all corresponding adaptation rules at once theorem gives promising insights direction
also demonstrate "k-means" energy function pseudo-potential but not potential general
consequently energy function associated "neural-gas" not potential general
 introduction 
vector quantization theory  set prototypes placed manifold  order minimize following integral function called "energy function": } where indicates probability density defined
focus stochastic iterative approaches where at each time step datum drawn probability density function pdf  prototypes adapted according using adaptation rule: } where adaptation step tuned using parameter generally decreasing over time  taken thereafter equal 1 without restricting general results "neighborhood" function particular each vector quantization algorithm
here focus discontinuous functions
main concern field vector quantization decide whether adaptation rule  corresponds not stochastic gradient descent along energy function  i e whether energy function not potential onto entire manifold
one hand if energy function potential then convergence prototypes obeying their adaptation rule toward minimum energy function well established particular stochastic optimization framework paper concerned
example energy function associated k-means algorithm  stochastic version lbg algorithm linde et al  potential long pdf continuous
other hand if energy function not potential then very few known about convergence corresponding adaptation rule
example several results already shown continuous density  corresponding vector adaptation rule kohonen self-organizing map som algorithm does not correspond stochastic gradient descent along global energy function convergence although being observed practice turns out very difficult prove not mention most efforts been carried out kohonen rule
all vector quantization algorithms study paper variants k-means algorithm will see section
know algorithms converge practice toward acceptable value their energy functions whenever they proved associated not potentials
however theoretical study their convergence not available so they remain largely heuristics
among all algorithms neural-gas deserves particular attention
been claimed its authors associated global potential general hence converging adaptation rule
propose counter-example discontinuous pdf demonstrates claim not true
shows study convergence all algorithms still its infancy motivates present work
paper propose framework encompasses all algorithms
study framework demonstrate energy function associated algorithms not potential general
also demonstrate energy function belongs broad class functions includes potential functions special case
energy functions within class called "pseudo-potentials"
results obtain do not depend continuity probability density function  give first step toward explanation why all algorithms shown belong framework succeed practice minimizing their associated energy function whether they potentials not
framework should open up further avenues general study convergence properties all algorithms contains at once
section 2 present framework study
section 3 define "pseudo-potential" function approximated series potential functions: define concept cellular manifold series potentials
section 4 give main theorem states energy function framework necessarily pseudo-potential
consider k-means show pseudo-potentials not always potentials
discuss consequence convergence corresponding adaptation rule
section 5 show most common vector quantization algorithms belong framework
at last conclude section 6
