 introduction 
paper uncovers explores some aspects close relationship between monte carlo optimization parametrized integral mco parametric machine learning pl `blackbox' `oracle-based' optimization bo
make four primary contributions
first establish mathematical identity equating mco pl
identity potentially provides new application domain all broadly-applicable pl techniques viz  mco
our second contribution introduction immediate sampling
new version probability collectives pc approach blackbox optimization
pc encompasses estimation distribution algorithms edas cross entropy ce method special cases
however pc broader more fully motivated
means uncovers overcomes formal shortcomings those other approaches
immediate sampling version pc original bo problem transformed into mco problem
light our first contribution means apply pl immediate sampling
way pl techniques  including cross-validation bagging boosting active learning stacking others  applied blackbox optimization
our third contribution experimentally explore power identity between mco pl
experiments demonstrate cross-validation bagging improve performance immediate sampling blackbox optimization
particular experiments show cross-validation used adaptively set `annealing schedule' blackbox optimization using immediate sampling {\it{without any extra calls oracle}}
some cases show adaptively formed annealing schedule results better optimization performance than any exponential annealing schedule {} finally conventional mc mco procedures ignore relationship between sample point locations associated values integrand only values integrand at sample locations considered algorithms  end exploring ways use pl techniques exploit information sample locations instance bayesian fitting surface sample locations associated values integrand
constitutes yet another way applying pl mco general therefore bo particular
