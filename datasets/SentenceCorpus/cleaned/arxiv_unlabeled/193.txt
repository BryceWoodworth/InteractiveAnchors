 
grammar inference deals determining preferable simple models/grammars consistent set observations
there large body research grammar inference within theory formal languages
however there surprisingly little known grammar inference graph grammars
paper take further step direction work within framework node label controlled nlc graph grammars
specifically characterize given set disjoint isomorphic subgraphs graph  whether not there nlc graph grammar rule generate subgraphs obtain
generalizes previous results assuming set isomorphic subgraphs disjoint instead non-touching
leads naturally consider more involved ``non-confluent'' graph grammar rules
 introduction 
grammar inference also called grammar induction general line research where one concerned determining ``simple'' grammar consistent given set possible impossible outcomes
hence one ``goes back'' derivation: instead determining generative power grammar one determines grammar given generated output
topic well-studied formal languages especially respect context-free languages see eg  however relatively little known graph grammars
topic inference graph grammars considered uses their so-called subdue scheme developed
rigorous approach grammar inference within framework node label controlled nlc graph grammars  natural well-studied class graph grammars initiated
there characterized given set non-touching isomorphic graphs graph  whether not there graph grammar consisting one rule able generate graphs obtain
continue research generalize result case where graphs disjoint instead non-touching
generalization requires one deal number issues
most notably one deal non-confluency issues: generated graph depends order touching subgraphs generated \addconf{due space constraints proofs results omitted but found extended version
