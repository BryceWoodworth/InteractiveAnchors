 
images segmented first using classifier predict affinity graph reflects degree image pixels must grouped together then partitioning graph yield segmentation
machine learning been applied affinity classifier produce affinity graphs good sense minimizing edge misclassification rates
however error measure only indirectly related quality segmentations produced ultimately partitioning affinity graph
present first machine learning algorithm training classifier produce affinity graphs good sense producing segmentations directly minimize rand index well known segmentation performance measure
rand index measures segmentation performance quantifying classification connectivity image pixel pairs after segmentation
using simple graph partitioning algorithm finding connected components thresholded affinity graph able train affinity classifier directly minimize rand index segmentations resulting graph partitioning
our learning algorithm corresponds learning maximin affinities between image pixel pairs predictive pixel-pair connectivity
 introduction 
supervised learning emerged serious contender field image segmentation ever since creation training sets images {}``ground truth'' segmentations provided humans berkeley segmentation dataset
supervised learning requires 1 parametrized algorithm map images segmentations 2 objective function quantifies performance segmentation algorithm relative ground truth 3 means searching parameter space segmentation algorithm optimum objective function
supervised learning method presented here segmentation algorithm consists parametrized classifier predicts weights nearest neighbor affinity graph over image pixels followed graph partitioner thresholds affinity graph finds its connected components
our objective function rand index  recently been proposed quantitative measure segmentation performance
{}``soften'' thresholding classifier output adjust parameters classifier gradient learning based rand index
because maximin edges affinity graph play key role our learning method call maximin affinity learning image segmentation  malis
minimax path edge standard concepts graph theory maximin opposite-sign sibling minimax
hence our work viewed machine learning application graph theoretic concepts
malis focuses improving classifier output at maximin edges because classifying edges incorrectly leads genuine segmentation errors splitting merging segments
best our knowledge malis first supervised learning method based optimizing genuine measure segmentation performance
idea training classifier predict weights affinity graph not novel
affinity classifiers were previously trained minimize number misclassified affinity edges
not same optimizing segmentations produced partitioning affinity graph
there been attempts train affinity classifiers produce good segmentations when partitioned normalized cuts
but approaches do not optimize genuine measure segmentation performance rand index
work bach jordan closest our work
however they only minimize upper bound renormalized version rand index
both approaches require many approximations make learning tractable
other related work classifiers been trained optimize performance at detecting image pixels belong object boundaries
our classifier also viewed boundary detector since nearest neighbor affinity graph essentially same boundary map up sign inversion
however combine our classifier graph partitioner produce segmentations
classifier parameters not trained optimize performance at boundary detection but optimize performance at segmentation measured rand index
there also methods supervised learning image labeling using markov conditional random fields
but image labeling more similar multi-class pixel classification rather than image segmentation latter task may require distinguishing between multiple objects single image all same label
cases where probabilistic random field models been used image parsing segmentation models either been simplistic tractability reasons been trained piecemeal
instance tu et al separately train low-level discriminative modules based boosting classifier train high-level modules their algorithm model joint distribution image labeling
models never been trained minimize rand index
