evaluate model one artificial task three real-world tasks comparing against both unsupervised state-of-the-art supervised algorithms
our results show our model able outperform other models across variety tasks performance metrics
 introduction 
supervised clustering general characterization problem occurs frequently strikingly different communities
like standard clustering problem involves breaking finite set into way partition unknown
distinction between supervised clustering standard clustering supervised form given training examples
training examples enable learning algorithm determine what aspects relevant creating appropriate clustering
training examples subsets paired their correct partitioning
end supervised clustering task prediction problem: new presented system must produce partition
supervised clustering problem goes under many names depending goals interested community
relational learning community typically referred identity uncertainty primary task augment reasoning system so does not implicitly even explicitly assume there one-to-one correspondence between elements knowledge base entities real world
database community task arises context merging databases overlapping fields known record linkage
information extraction particularly context extracting citations scholarly publications task identify citations same publication
here task known reference matching
natural language processing problem arises context coreference resolution  wherein one wishes identify entities mentioned document same person organization real life
machine learning community additionally been referred learning under equivalence constraints learning cluster examples
paper propose generative model solving supervised clustering problem
our model takes advantage dirichlet process prior  non-parametric bayesian prior over discrete distributions
prior plays two crucial roles: first allows us estimate number clusters principled manner; second allows us control complexity solutions learned
present inference methods our model based markov chain monte carlo methods
compare our model against other methods large real-world data sets where show able outperform most other systems according several metrics performance
