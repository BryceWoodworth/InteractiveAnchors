 
fundamental problem artificial intelligence nobody really knows what intelligence
problem especially acute when need consider artificial systems significantly different humans
paper approach problem following way: take number well known informal definitions human intelligence been given experts extract their essential features
then mathematically formalised produce general measure intelligence arbitrary machines
believe measure formally captures concept machine intelligence broadest reasonable sense
 introduction 
most us think recognise intelligence when see but not really sure how precisely define measure
informally judge intelligence others relying our past experiences dealing people
naturally naive approach highly subjective imprecise
more principled approach would use one many standard intelligence tests available
contrary popular wisdom tests when correctly applied professional deliver statistically consistent results considerable power predict future performance individuals many mentally demanding tasks
however while tests work well humans if wish measure intelligence other things perhaps monkey new machine learning algorithm they clearly inappropriate
one response problem might develop specific kinds tests specific kinds entities; just intelligence tests children differ intelligence tests adults
while works well when testing humans different ages comes undone when need measure intelligence entities profoundly different each other terms their cognitive capacities speed senses environments they operate so
measure intelligence diverse systems meaningful way must step back specifics particular systems establish underlying fundamentals what really trying measure
need establish notion intelligence goes beyond specifics particular kinds systems
difficulty doing readily apparent
consider example memory numerical computation tasks appear some intelligence tests were once regarded defining hallmarks human intelligence
now know tasks absolutely trivial machine thus do not test machine's intelligence
indeed even mentally demanding task playing chess been largely reduced brute force search
technology advances our concept what intelligence continues evolve
how then develop concept intelligence applicable all kinds systems
any proposed definition must encompass essence human intelligence well other possibilities consistent way
should not limited any particular set senses environments goals nor should limited any specific kind hardware silicon biological neurons
should based principles sufficiently fundamental so unlikely alter over time
furthermore intelligence measure should ideally formally expressed objective practically realisable
paper approaches problem following way
section consider range definitions human intelligence been put forward well known psychologists
extract most common essential features use them create informal definition intelligence
section then introduces framework use construct our formal measure intelligence
framework formally defined section
section use our developed formalism produce formal definition intelligence
section closes short summary
preliminary sketch ideas paper appeared poster
shown intelligence measure presented here fact variant intelligence order relation appears theory aixi provably optimal universal agent
long journal version paper being written give proposed measure machine intelligence its relation other tests much more comprehensive treatment
naturally expect bold initiative met resistance
however hope reader will appreciate value our approach: formally precise definition put forward aim better our understanding what notoriously subjective slippery concept
