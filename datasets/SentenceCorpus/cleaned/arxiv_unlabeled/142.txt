 introduction 
fuzzy learning methods unlike ``black-box'' models neural networks likely give interpretable results provided some constraints respected
while ability somewhat meaningless some applications stock market prediction becomes essential when human experts want gain insight into complex problem e g industrial biological processes climate evolution 
considerations explain why interpretability issues fuzzy modeling become important research topic shown recent literature
even so meaning given interpretability fuzzy modeling not always same
interpretability some authors mean mathematical interpretability where structure developed takagi-sugeno systems leads interpretation every consequent polynomial taylor series expansion about rule center
others mean linguistic interpretability 
present paper focused latter approach
commonly admitted requirements interpretability small number consistent membership functions reasonable number rules fuzzy system
orthogonal transformation methods provide set tools building rules data selecting limited subset rules
those methods were originally designed linear optimization but subject some conditions they used fuzzy models
instance zero order takagi sugeno model written set r fuzzy rules rule being: } where fuzzy sets associated variables given rule corresponding crisp rule conclusion
let input-output pairs data set where
pair above takagi sugeno model output calculated follows: } equation  conjunction operator used combine elements rule premise represents within rule membership function value
let us introduce rule firing strength
thus equation rewritten as: } once fuzzy partitions been set provided given data set computed all data set
then equation allows reformulate fuzzy model linear regression problem written matrix form as:
matrix form y sample output vector p firing strength matrix rule consequent vector e error term
orthogonal transformation methods then used determine kept assign them optimal values order design zero order takagi sugeno model data set
thorough review use orthogonal transformation methods svd qr ols select fuzzy rules found
they divided into two main families: methods select rules using matrix decomposition only others also use output do best fit
first family methods rank revealing techniques particularly interesting when input fuzzy partitions include redundant quasi redundant fuzzy sets
orthogonal least squares ols technique belongs second family allows rule selection based rule respective contribution output inertia variance
respect criterion gives good summary system modeled explains why been widely used statistics also why particularly suited rule induction shown instance
aim present paper establish using ols method example orthogonal transformation results made interpretable without suffering too much loss accuracy
achieved building interpretable fuzzy partitions reducing number rule conclusions
turns orthogonal transformations into useful tools modeling regression problems extracting knowledge data
thus they worth careful study there few available techniques achieving double objective contrary knowledge induction classification problems
