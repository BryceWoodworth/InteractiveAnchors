method boils down statistical estimation task various estimators been proposed based geometric mean  harmonic mean  fractional power etc
study proposes optimal quantile estimator whose main operation selecting  considerably less expensive than taking fractional power main operation previous estimators
our experiments report optimal quantile estimator nearly one order magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators
large-scale learning tasks storing computing pairwise distances serious bottleneck estimator should desirable
addition its computational advantages optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties
more accurate than previous estimators when {symbol }
derive its theoretical error bounds establish explicit i e  no hidden constants sample complexity bound
 introduction 
method stable random projections  efficient tool computing pairwise distances massive high-dimensional data provides promising mechanism tackle some challenges modern machine learning
paper provide easy-to-implement algorithm stable random projections both statistically accurate computationally efficient
