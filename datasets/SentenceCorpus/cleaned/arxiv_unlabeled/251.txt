our first class methods extends bayesian t-test include all parametric models exponential family their conjugate priors
our second class methods uses dirichlet process mixtures dpm conjugate-exponential distributions flexible nonparametric priors over unknown distributions
%on synthetic examples real medical datasets show our tests competitive best state-of-the-art methods task even outperforming them average medical datasets
 introduction 
paper tackle so-called two-sample problem: associated test called two-sample test
tests encountered various disciplines life sciences social sciences: medical studies one may want find out if two classes patients show different behaviour response drug susceptibility disease
microarray analysis one may compare measurements different weeks labs platforms find out if they follow same distribution before integrating them into one dataset order increase sample size
neurosciences one may want compare measurements brain signals under different external stimuli check whether brain activity affected stimuli
social sciences one may want compare whether behavior group people eg when they graduate marry die different across countries generations
financial sciences one could example compare set transactions performed at stock exchange during different weeks find out if there change activity financial markets
while question been studied detail classic statistics univariate data there less work multivariate data review section 
only machine learning approach problem kernel method  using means two samples universal reproducing kernel hilbert space its test statistics but created lots interest subject follow-on studies
here approach two-sample problem bayesian perspective
classic bayesian formulation problem would terms bayes factor represents likelihood ratio data were generated according hypothesis same distribution hypothesis different distributions
however how exactly define two hypotheses crucial question many answers been given bayesian literature hypotheses tailored specific problem application domain; one example bayesian t-tests used microarray data analysis
our goal paper define two general classes two-sample tests represent precise formulation two-sample problem but not tailored specific application
they designed offer attractive middle ground between general idea using bayes factors specialised hypotheses testing problems studied literature
detail define class nonparametric bayesian two sample tests based dirichlet process mixture models
use dirichlet process mixtures flexible nonparametric modelling general unknown distributions long history statistics
however although two-sample problem depends crucially testing whether data come one two unknown distributions bayesian approaches based nonparametric density models not been explored date
here propose explore non-parametric method using classic dirichlet process mixture
best our knowledge only work remotely related bayesian test parametric versus nonparametric model data berger guglielmi
addresses different but related question since assumes parametric null hypothesis
also define parametric bayesian two-sample test where model data member exponential family
test generalizes bayesian t-test  who assume samples gaussian
paper structured follows
section will review existing approaches two-sample problem multivariate data highlight some differences between frequentist bayesian hypothesis testing
section outline common core our two bayesian two-sample test before providing details parametric test section non-parametric test section
%in section will evaluate performance our tests comparing state-of-the-art methods field
