 introduction 
using game-theoretic framework probability  vovk shafer shown always possible using randomization make sequential probability forecasts pass any countable set well-behaved statistical tests
result generalizes work other authors among them foster vohra  kakade foster  lehrer  sandrony et al   who consider only tests calibration
complement result lower bound
show vovk shafer's result valid only when forecasts computed unrestrictedly increasing degree accuracy
when some level discreteness fixed present game-theoretic version oakes' example randomized forecasting test failing any given method deterministic forecasting; originally example was presented deterministic calibration
formulate example use forecasting game presented vovk shafer  namely binary forecasting game ii
discuss details randomized forecasting algorithms section
shafer vovk's game-theoretic framework considered section
present section original vovk shafer's result universal randomized forecasting prove our result gives limits forecasting  game-theoretic version oakes' example randomized forecasting
