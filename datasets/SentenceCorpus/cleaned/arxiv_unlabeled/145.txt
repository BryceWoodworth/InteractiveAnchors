past four tasks been treated independently using wide variety algorithms
four semantic classes however tiny sample full range semantic phenomena cannot afford create ad hoc algorithms each semantic phenomenon; need seek unified approach
propose subsume broad range phenomena under analogies
limit scope paper restrict our attention subsumption synonyms antonyms associations
introduce supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm classifying analogous word pairs show solve multiple-choice sat analogy questions toefl synonym questions esl synonym-antonym questions similar-associated-both questions cognitive psychology
 introduction 
pair words petrify:stone analogous another pair vaporize:gas when semantic relations between words first pair highly similar relations second pair
two words levied imposed synonymous context levied tax when they interchanged imposed tax they antonymous when they opposite meanings black white they associated when they tend co-occur doctor hospital
surface appears four distinct semantic classes requiring distinct nlp algorithms but propose uniform approach all four
subsume synonyms antonyms associations under analogies
essence say antonyms when pair : analogous pair black:white synonyms when they analogous pair levied:imposed associated when they analogous pair doctor:hospital
there past work recognizing analogies  synonyms  antonyms  associations  but each four tasks been examined separately isolation others
far know algorithm proposed here first attempt deal all four tasks using uniform approach
believe important seek nlp algorithms handle broad range semantic phenomena because developing specialized algorithm each phenomenon very inefficient research strategy
might seem lexicon wordnet  contains all information need handle four tasks
however prefer take corpus-based approach semantics
veale \shortcite{veale04} used wordnet answer 374 multiple-choice sat analogy questions achieving accuracy 43\% but best corpus-based approach attains accuracy 56\%
another reason prefer corpus-based approach lexicon-based approach former requires less human labour thus easier extend other languages
section describe our algorithm recognizing analogies
use standard supervised machine learning approach feature vectors based frequencies patterns large corpus
use support vector machine svm learn how classify feature vectors
section presents four sets experiments
apply our algorithm recognizing analogies multiple-choice analogy questions sat college entrance test multiple-choice synonym questions toefl test english foreign language esl english second language practice questions distinguishing synonyms antonyms set word pairs labeled similar  associated  both  developed experiments cognitive psychology
discuss results experiments section
accuracy algorithm competitive other systems but strength algorithm able handle all four tasks no tuning learning parameters particular task
performs well although competing against specialized algorithms developed single tasks
