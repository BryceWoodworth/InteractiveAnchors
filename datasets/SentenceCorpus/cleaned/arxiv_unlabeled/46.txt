 
approximation optimal two-part mdl code given data through successive monotonically length-decreasing two-part mdl codes following properties: i computation each step may take arbitrarily long; ii may not know when reach optimum whether will reach optimum at all; iii sequence models generated may not monotonically improve goodness fit; but iv model associated optimum almost best goodness fit
express practically interesting goodness fit individual models individual data sets rely kolmogorov complexity
 introduction 
machine learning pure applications mdl rare partially because difficulties one encounters trying define adequate model code data-to-model code partially because operational difficulties poorly understood
analyze aspects both power perils mdl precisely formally
let us first resurrect familiar problem our childhood illustrate some issues involved
process solving jigsaw puzzle involves incremental reduction entropy  serves illustrate analogous features learning problems main issues work
initially when pieces come out box they completely random ordering
gradually combine pieces thus reducing entropy increasing order until puzzle solved
last stage found maximal ordering
suppose alice bob both start solve two versions same puzzle but they follow different strategies
initially alice sorts all pieces according color bob starts sorting pieces according shape sake argument assume puzzle no recognizable edge pieces  crucial insight shared experienced puzzle aficionados alice's strategy efficient whereas bob's strategy not fact even worse than random strategy
alice's strategy efficient since probability pieces about same color match much greater than unconditional probability match
other hand information about shape pieces only used relatively late stage puzzle process
bob's effort beginning waste time because he must reorder pieces before he proceed solve puzzle
example shows if solution problem depends finding maximal reduction entropy does not mean every reduction entropy brings us closer solution
consequently reduction entropy not all cases good strategy
