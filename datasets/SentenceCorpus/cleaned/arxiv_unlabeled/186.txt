if fisher information matrix at true distribution singular then been left unknown what estimate about true distribution random samples
paper study singular regression problem prove limit theorem shows relation between singular regression problem two birational invariants real log canonical threshold singular fluctuation
obtained theorem important application statistics because enables us estimate generalization error training error without any knowledge true probability distribution
 introduction 
let natural numbers dimensional real euclidean spaces respectively
assume probability space valued random variable subject simultaneous probability density function where probability density function  constant measurable function  euclidean norm
function called regression function
assume set random variables independently subject same probability distribution
let subset
let function
square error real function  expectation operator defined } where measurable function probability density function  constant called inverse temperature
note not constant but random variable because depends random variables
two random variables defined *} random variables called generalization training errors respectively
since  expected some natural conditions both converge when tends infinity if there exists
paper ask how fast convergences other words our study concerns limit theorem shows convergences  when
if fisher information matrix where  positive definite arbitrary  then problem well known regular regression problem
fact regular regression problem convergences hold
however if singular say if  then problem called singular regression problem convergences been left unknown
general been difficult study limit theorem case when fisher information matrix singular
however recently shown limit theorem established based resolution singularities there mathematical relations between limit theorem two birational invariants singular density estimation
paper prove new limit theorem singular regression problem enables us estimate birational invariants random samples
limit theorem proved paper important application statistics because expectation value generalization error estimated training error without any knowledge true probability distribution \vskip3mm {example} let   
if function defined  then set not one point fisher information matrix at singular
lot functions used statistics information science brain informatics bio-informatics singular example artificial neural networks radial basis functions wavelet functions
