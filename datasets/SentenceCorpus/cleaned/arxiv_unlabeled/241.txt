 introduction 
several studies related machine learning quantum mechanics recently been conducted
main idea behind been based generalization probability distribution obtained using density matrix self-adjoint positive-semidefinite matrix trace one
connects basic probability rule quantum mechanics called ``born rule'' formulates generalized probability using density matrix spectral clustering other machine learning algorithms based spectral theory
combined margin maximization scheme probabilistic modeling approach incorporating concepts quantum detection estimation theory
proposed quantum markov random field using density matrix quantum mechanics applied image restoration
generalizing bayesian framework based density matrix also been proposed
proposed ``quantum bayes rule'' conditional density between two probability spaces
warmuth et al generalized bayes rule treat case where prior was density matrix unified bayesian probability calculus density matrices rules translation between joints conditionals
typically formulas derived quantum mechanics generalization retained conventional theory special case when density matrices been diagonal
computing full posterior distributions over model parameters probabilistic graphical models eg latent dirichlet allocation  remains difficult quantum bayesian frameworks well classical bayesian frameworks
paper generalize variational bayes inference  widely used framework probabilistic graphical models based ideas been used quantum mechanics
variational bayes vb inference been widely used approximation bayesian inference probabilistic models discrete latent variables
example probabilistic mixture model mixture gaussians each data point assigned latent class latent variable corresponding data point indicates latent class
vb optimization algorithm minimizes cost function
cost function called negative variational free energy function latent variables
called cost function ``energy'' paper
since vb gradient algorithm similar expectation maximization em algorithm suffers local optimal problem practice
deterministic annealing da algorithms been proposed em algorithm vb based simulated annealing sa overcome issue local optima
called simulated annealing based vb savb
sa one most well known physics based approaches machine learning
sa based concept statistical mechanics called ``temperature''
decrease parameter ``temperature'' gradually sa
because energy landscape becomes flat at high temperature easy change state see fig
however state trapped at low temperature because valley energy barrier transition probability becomes very low
therefore sa does not necessarily find global optimum practical cooling schedule temperature
physics quantum annealing qa attracted attention alternative annealing method optimization problems process analogous quantum fluctuations
qa expected help states avoid being trapped poor local optima at low temperatures
main point paper explain novel da algorithm vb based qa qavb derived present effects qavb obtained through experiments
qavb generalization vb savb attained using density matrix
describe our motivation deriving qavb terms density matrix section
here overview qavb derived
interestingly although qavb generalized formulated density matrix algorithm qavb finally derived does not need operations density matrix eigenvalue decomposition only simple changes savb algorithm
since savb does not necessarily find global optimum still need run multiple savbs independently different random initializations where denote number savbs
here let us consider running dependently not independently multiple savbs where ``dependently'' means run multiple savbs introducing interaction among neighboring savbs randomly numbered  see fig b
fig  indicates latent class states data points th savb
independent savbs very low transition probability among states i e  they been trapped at high temperature shown fig c while dependent qavbs changes state situation
because interaction starts zero i e  ``independent'' gradually increases makes approach each other state will then moved into
if there better state around sub-optimal states independent savbs find dependent savbs expected work well
dependent savbs just qavb where interaction above scheme derived qa mechanisms will explained following section
