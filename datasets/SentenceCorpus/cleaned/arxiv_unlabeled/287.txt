 
sampling-based methods previously been proposed problem finding interesting associations data even low-support items
while methods do not guarantee precise results they vastly more efficient than approaches rely exact counting
however many similarity measures no methods been known
paper show how wide variety measures supported simple biased\/ sampling method
method also extends find high-confidence association rules
demonstrate theoretically our method superior exact methods when threshold ``interesting similarity/confidence'' above average pairwise similarity/confidence average support not too low
our method particularly good when transactions contain many items
confirm experiments standard association mining benchmarks gives significant speedup real data sets sometimes much larger than theoretical guarantees
reductions computation time over order magnitude significant savings space observed
 introduction 
central task data mining finding associations binary relation
typically phrased ``market basket'' setup where there sequence baskets now ``transactions'' each set items
goal find patterns ``customers who buy diapers more likely also buy beer''
there no canonical way defining whether association interesting  indeed seems depend problem-specific factors not captured formulation
result number measures exist: paper deal some most common measures including jaccard   lift   cosine  all\_confidence 
addition interested high-confidence association rules closely related overlap coefficient\/ similarity measure
refer general background discussion similarity measures
discussion limit ourselves problem binary associations i e  patterns involving pairs items
there large literature considering challenges finding patterns involving larger item sets taking into account aspect time multiple-level rules etc
while some our results extended cover larger item sets will simplicity concentrate binary case
previous methods rely one following approaches: identifying item pairs ``occur frequently together'' transactions  particular means counting number co-occurrences each pair  computing ``signature'' each item similarity every pair items estimated partially comparing item signatures
our approach different both approaches generally offers improved performance and/or flexibility
some sense go directly desired result set pairs items similarity measure above some user-defined threshold
our method sampling\/ based means output may contain false positives there may false negatives
however errors rigorously understood reduced any desired level at some cost efficiency  our experimental results false negative probability less than 2\%
method doing sampling main novelty paper radically different previous approaches involve sampling
main focus many previous association mining papers been space usage\/ number passes\/ over data set since been recognized main bottlenecks
believe time come also carefully consider cpu time
transaction items contains item pairs if not small effort considering all pairs non-negligible compared cost reading item set
true particular if data resides ram modern ssd able deliver data at rate more than gigabyte per second
one remedy been used reduce space but also time require high support  i e  define ``occur frequently together'' most items thrown away initially simply because they do not occur frequently enough they below support threshold\/ 
however observed means potentially interesting useful associations e g correlations between genes rare diseases not reported
paper consider problem finding associations without\/ support pruning
course support pruning still used reduce size data set before our algorithms applied
following sections first discuss need focusing cpu time data mining then elaborate relationship between our contribution related works
