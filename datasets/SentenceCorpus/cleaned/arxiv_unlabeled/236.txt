problem viewed information--theoretic variant well--studied matrix completion problem main objective design efficient algorithm reconstruct matrix inspecting only small number its entries
although impossible task general cand\`{e}s co--authors recently shown under so--called incoherence assumption rank matrix reconstructed using semidefinite programming sdp after one inspects its entries
paper propose alternative approach much more efficient reconstruct larger class matrices inspecting significantly smaller number entries
specifically first introduce class so--called stable matrices show includes all those satisfy incoherence assumption
then propose randomized basis pursuit rbp algorithm show reconstruct stable rank matrix after inspecting its entries
our sampling bound only logarithmic factor away information--theoretic limit essentially optimal
moreover runtime rbp algorithm bounded  compares very favorably runtime sdp--based algorithm
perhaps more importantly our algorithm will provide exact reconstruction input matrix polynomial time
contrast sdp--based algorithm only provide approximate one polynomial time
 introduction 
fundamental problem arises frequently many disciplines reconstructing matrix certain properties some partial information
typically problem motivated desire deduce global structure small number local observations
instance consider following applications: {covariance estimation } areas statistics machine learning wireless communications often interest find maximum likelihood estimate covariance matrix random vector
estimate used study relationship among variables  give some indication performance certain systems
usually extra information available facilitate estimation
instance may number independent samples drawn according distribution  well some structural constraints e g  certain entries prescribed values  matrix toeplitz structure some its entries prescribed values  etc 
thus estimation problem becomes completing partially specified matrix so completion satisfies structural constraints maximizes certain likelihood function {graph realization } trivial matter see given coordinates points  distance between any two points computed efficiently
however inverse problem  given subset interpoint distances find coordinates points called realization  where fixed fit those distances  turns out anything but trivial see eg  
problem arises many different contexts sensor network localization see eg   molecular conformation see e
g  equivalent problem completing partially specified matrix euclidean distance matrix certain rank cf   {recovering structure motion } fundamental problem computer vision reconstruct structure object analyzing its motion over time
problem known structure motion sfm problem literature formulated finding low--rank approximation certain measurement matrix see eg  
however due presence occlusion tracking failures measurement matrix often missing entries
when one takes into account difficulties reconstruction problem becomes completing partially specified matrix one certain rank see eg   {recommendation systems } although electronic commerce offered great convenience customers merchants alike complicated task tracking predicting customers' preferences
cope problem various recommendation systems been developed over years see eg  
roughly speaking those systems maintain matrix preferences where rows correspond users columns correspond items
when user purchases browses subset items she specify her preferences those items those preferences will then recorded corresponding entries matrix
naturally if user not considered particular item then corresponding entry matrix will remain unspecified
now order predict users' preferences unseen items one will complete partially specified matrix so completion maximizes certain performance measure each individual's utility 
note all examples above forced take whatever information given us
particular cannot instance specify entries unknown matrix examine
result reconstruction problem ill--posed e g  there may not unique even any solution satisfies given criteria
indeed important issue
however shall not address paper see eg  related work
instead take different approach consider information--theoretic aspects reconstruction problem
specifically let rank matrix wish reconstruct
sake simplicity suppose known
initially no information about other than its rank available
however allowed inspect any entry inspect many entries desire order complete reconstruction
course if inspect all entries  then will able reconstruct exactly
thus natural ask whether inspect only small number entries still able reconstruct efficient manner
besides being theoretical curiosity problem does arise practical applications
instance sensor network localization setting  aforementioned problem tantamount asking pairwise distances needed order guarantee successful reconstruction network topology
turns out if number required pairwise distances small then will able efficiently reconstruct network topology performing just few distance measurements solving small semidefinite program sdp
get idea what should aim let us first determine degrees freedom available specifying rank matrix
will give us lower bound number entries need inspect order guarantee exact reconstruction
towards end consider singular value decomposition svd  where orthonormal columns diagonal matrix
clearly there degrees freedom specifying
now observe  th column must orthogonal all previous columns must unit length
thus there degrees freedom specifying th column  implies there degrees freedom specifying
same argument there degrees freedom specifying
hence have: \theta(\delta nn a=e_1e_1^t e_1=(1,0,\ldots,0)\in\r^n \theta(\delta a$
