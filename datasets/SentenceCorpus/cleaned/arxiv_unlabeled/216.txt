 
consider problem estimating conditional probability label time  where number possible labels
analyze natural reduction problem set binary regression problems organized tree structure proving regret bound scales depth tree
motivated analysis propose first online algorithm provably constructs logarithmic depth tree set labels solve problem
test algorithm empirically showing works succesfully dataset roughly labels
 introduction 
central question paper how efficiently estimate conditional probability label given observation
virtually all approaches solving problem require time
commonly used one-against-all approach tries predict probability label versus all other labels each  requires time per training example
another common approach learn scoring function convert into conditional probability estimate according  where normalization factor
motivation dealing computational difficulty usual one---we want capability solve otherwise unsolvable problems
example one our experiments involves probabilistic prediction problem roughly labels examples where any solution intractable
