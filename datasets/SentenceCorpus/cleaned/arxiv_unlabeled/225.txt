working new data set collected over period 7 years
using level ca125 mass-spectrometry peaks our algorithm gives probability predictions disease
estimate classification accuracy convert probability predictions into strict predictions
our algorithm makes fewer errors than almost any linear combination ca125 level one peak's intensity taken log scale
check power our algorithm use test hypothesis ca125 peaks do not contain useful information prediction disease at particular time before diagnosis
our algorithm produces values better than those produced algorithm been previously applied data set

 introduction 
early detection ovarian cancer important since clinical symptoms sometimes do not appear until late stage disease
leads difficulties treatment patient
using antigen ca125 significantly improves quality diagnosis
however ca125 becomes less reliable at early stages sometimes elevates too late make use
our goal investigate whether existing methods online prediction improve quality detection disease demonstrate information contained mass spectra useful ovarian cancer diagnosis early stages disease
refer combination ca125 peak intensity meaning decision rule form *} where level ca125 intensity th peak taken sets described below
consider prediction triplets : each case sample accompanied two samples healthy individuals matched controls  chosen close possible case sample respect attributes age storage conditions serum processing
given triplet samples different individuals detect one sample predict cancer
framework was first described
authors analyze ovarian cancer data set show information contained mass-spectrometry peaks help provide more precise reliable predictions diseased patient than ca125 criteria itself some months before moment diagnosis
paper use same framework set decision rules ca125 combined peak intensity derive algorithm performs better some sense than any rules
our research use different more recent ovarian cancer data set processed authors larger number items than
combine decision rules proposed using online prediction algorithm\footnote[1]{a survey online prediction found } thus get our own decision rule
paper use combining algorithm described  because allows us output probability measure given triplet best theoretical guarantees type prediction
order estimate classification accuracy convert probability predictions into strict predictions maximum rule : assign weight 1 labels maximum predicted probability weight 0 labels other samples then normalize assigned weights
show our algorithm gives more reliable predictions than vast majority particular combinations fact more thorough experiments not described here show outperforms all particular combinations
performs well different stages disease
when testing hypothesis ca125 peaks do not contain useful information prediction disease at its early stages our algorithm gives better values comparison algorithm chooses best combination; addition our algorithm requires fewer adjustments
our paper organized follows
section describe methods use give predictions
section gives short description data set work
show our experiments results section separated into description probability prediction algorithm subsection detection at different stages before diagnosis subsection
section concludes our paper
