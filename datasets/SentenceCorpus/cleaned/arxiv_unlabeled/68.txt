conformal prediction designed on-line setting labels predicted successively each one being revealed before next predicted
most novel valuable feature conformal prediction if successive examples sampled independently same distribution then successive predictions will right time even though they based accumulating dataset rather than independent datasets

 introduction 
how good your prediction
if you predicting label new object how confident you
if label number how close do you think
machine learning questions usually answered fairly rough way past experience
expect new predictions fare about well past predictions
conformal prediction uses past experience determine precise levels confidence predictions
given method making prediction  conformal prediction produces prediction region set contains probability at least
typically also contains prediction
call point prediction  call region prediction
case regression where number typically interval around
case classification where limited number possible values may consist few values ideal case just one
conformal prediction used any method point prediction classification regression including support-vector machines decision trees boosting neural networks bayesian prediction
starting method point prediction construct nonconformity measure  measures how unusual example looks relative previous examples conformal algorithm turns nonconformity measure into prediction regions
given nonconformity measure conformal algorithm produces prediction region every probability error
region  prediction region ; contains probability at least
regions different nested: when  so lower level confidence than 
if contains only single label ideal outcome case classification may ask how small made before must enlarge adding second label; corresponding value confidence assert predicted label
explain in~\s conformal algorithm designed on-line setting predict labels objects successively seeing each label after predicted before predict next one
our prediction th label may use observed features th object preceding examples
size prediction region may also depend details
readers most interested implementing conformal algorithm may wish turn directly elementary examples and~and then turn back earlier more general material needed
explain \s on-line picture leads new concept validity prediction confidence
classically method finding prediction regions was considered valid if had probability containing label predicted because law large numbers would then correct time when repeatedly applied independent datasets
but on-line picture repeatedly apply method not independent datasets but accumulating dataset
after using predict  use predict  so
on-line method valid predictions must correct
under minimal assumptions conformal prediction valid new powerful sense
one setting where conformal prediction valid new on-line sense one examples sampled independently constant population---i e  fixed but unknown probability distribution
also valid under slightly weaker assumption examples probabilistically exchangeable see \s under other on-line compression models including widely used gaussian linear model see \s
validity conformal prediction under models demonstrated appendix
addition validity method producing prediction regions also interested its efficiency
efficient if prediction region usually relatively small therefore informative
classification would like see 95\% prediction region so small contains only single predicted label
regression would like see very narrow interval around predicted number
claim 95\% confidence 95\% conformal prediction region valid under exchangeability no matter what probability distribution examples follow no matter what nonconformity measure used construct conformal prediction region
but efficiency conformal prediction will depend nonconformity measure
if think know  may choose nonconformity measure will efficient if right
if prior probabilities  may use prior probabilities construct point predictor nonconformity measure
regression case might use mean posterior distribution given first examples ; classification case might use label greatest posterior probability
strategy first guaranteeing validity under relatively weak assumption then seeking efficiency under stronger assumptions conforms advice long given john tukey others
