 introduction 
pattern recognition learning data mining one obtains information objects containing information
involves objective definition information single object information go one object another object pair objects information go one object any other object multiple objects shared information between objects
classical notion kolmogorov complexity objective measure information single object information distance measures information between pair objects
last notion spawned research theoretical direction among others
research practical direction focused normalized information distance similarity metric arises normalizing information distance proper manner approximating kolmogorov complexity through real-world compressors  normalized information distance parameter-free feature-free alignment-free similarity measure had great impact applications
variant compression distance been tested all time sequence databases used last decade major data mining conferences sigkdd sigmod icdm icde ssdb vldb pkdd pakdd
conclusion method competitive all 51 other methods used superior heterogenous data clustering anomaly detection
was shown method resistant noise
theory found many applications pattern recognition phylogeny clustering classification
objects represented computer files applications range weather forecasting software earthquake prediction music literature ocr bioinformatics internet
objects only represented name objects like `red,' `einstein,' `three,' normalized information distance uses background information provided google any search engine produces aggregate page counts
discovers `meaning' words phrases sense producing relative semantics
applications run ontology semantics tourism web taxonomy multilingual questions question-answer systems
more references either subject see textbook google scholar references
however many applications interested shared information between many objects instead just pair objects
example customer reviews gadgets blogs about public happenings newspaper articles about same occurrence interested most comprehensive one most specialized one
thus want extend information distance measure pairs multiples
