 introduction 
probabilistic grammatical inference data often arise form finite sequence words over some predefined alphabet
words assumed independently drawn according fixed but unknown probability distribution over
probability distributions over free monoids called stochastic languages
usual goal grammatical inference try infer approximation distribution some class probabilistic models probabilistic automata
probabilistic automaton pa composed structure  finite automaton nfa parameters associated states transitions represent probability state initial terminal probability transition chosen
easily shown probabilistic automata same expressivity hidden markov models hmm heavily used statistical inference
given structure probabilistic automaton sequence words  computing parameters maximize likelihood np-hard
practical cases however algorithms based e m  expectation-maximization  method used compute approximate values
other hand inferring probabilistic automaton structure parameters sequence words widely open field research
most results obtained so far only deal restricted subclasses pa probabilistic deterministic automata pda i e probabilistic automata whose structure deterministic dfa probabilistic residual automata pra i e probabilistic automata whose structure residual finite state automaton rfsa
other respects noticed stochastic languages particular cases formal power series probabilistic automata also particular cases multiplicity automata  notions been extensively studied field formal language theory
therefore stochastic languages generated multiplicity automata special cases rational languages
call them rational stochastic languages
goal present paper provide systematic comprehensive study rational stochastic languages so bring out properties could useful grammatical inference purpose
indeed considering objects infer special cases rational languages makes possible use powerful theoretical tools been developed field hence give answers many questions naturally arise when working them: possible decide within polynomial time whether two probabilistic automata generate same stochastic language
does allowing negative coefficients probabilistic automata extend class generated stochastic languages
rational stochastic language takes all its values always generated multiplicity automata coefficients
so forth
also studying rational stochastic languages themselves considered objects language theory helps bring out notions properties important grammatical inference pespective: example show notion residual language derivative so important grammatical inference  natural counterpart stochastic languages  used express many properties classes stochastic languages
formal power series take their values semiring : let us denote set all formal power series
here only consider semirings  
any semiring  define set rational stochastic languages set stochastic languages over rational languages over
any two distinct semirings  corresponding sets rational stochastic languages distinct
show fatou extension stochastic languages means any rational stochastic language over takes its values also rational over
however not fatou extension stochastic languages: there exists rational stochastic language over takes its values not rational over
any stochastic language over any word  let us define residual language respect : residual languages clearly stochastic languages
show residual languages rational stochastic language over also rational over
residual subsemimodule spanned residual languages any stochastic language may used express rationality : rational iff included finitely generated subsemimodule
but when positive i e  may happen itself not finitely generated
study properties two subclasses : set composed rational stochastic languages over whose residual subsemimodule finitely generated set composed rational stochastic languages over finitely many residual languages
show any two classes fatou extension : any stochastic language resp
 takes its values element resp

also show any element  there exists unique minimal subset residual languages generates
then study representation rational stochastic languages means multiplicity automata
first show set multiplicity automata parameters generate stochastic languages not recursive
moreover contains no recursively enumerable subset capable generate whole set rational stochastic languages over
stochastic language formal series two properties: i any word  ii
show undecidability comes first requirement since second one decided within polynomial time
show set stochastic languages generated probabilistic automata parameters resp
 exactly coincides resp

probabilistic automaton called probabilistic residual automaton pra if stochastic languages associated its states residual languages stochastic languages generated
show set stochastic languages generated probabilistic residual automata parameters resp
 exactly coincides resp

do not know whether class pra decidable
however describe two decidable subclasses pra capable generating when : class reduced pra class prefixial pra
first one provides minimal representation class pra but show membership problem pspace-complete
second one produces more cumbersome representation but membership problem polynomial
finally show set stochastic languages generated probabilistic deterministic automata parameters resp
 exactly coincides  also equal resp
 also equal
