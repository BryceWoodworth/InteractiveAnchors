 introduction 
many common data sets modeled mixtures flats i e  affine subspaces
example feature vectors different moving objects video sequence lie different affine subspaces see eg   similarly images different faces under different illuminating conditions different linear subspaces each subspace corresponding distinct face
data give rise problem hybrid linear modeling i e  modeling data mixture flats
different kinds algorithms been suggested problem utilizing different mathematical theories
example generalized principal component analysis gpca based algebraic geometry agglomerative lossy compression alc uses information theory spectral curvature clustering scc uses multi-way clustering methods well multiscale geometric analysis
other hand there also some heuristic approaches eg  subspace separation local subspace affinity lsa
probably most straightforward method all flats kf algorithm any its variants
flats algorithm aims partition given data set into subsets  each well approximated its best fit flat
more formally given parameters  algorithm tries minimize objective function \sum_{i=1}^k \min_{d-\text{flats } l_i} \sum_{\bx_j \cx_i} \dist^2(\bx_j,l_i)\
practice minimization function performed iteratively means algorithm
after initialization flats example they may chosen randomly one repeats following two steps until convergence: 1 assign clusters according minimal distances flats determined at previous stage 2 compute least squares flats newly obtained clusters principal component analysis pca
procedure very fast guaranteed converge at least local minimum
however practice local minimum converges often significantly worse than global minimum
result flats algorithm not accurate more recent hybrid linear modeling algorithms even case underlying linear subspaces opposed general affine subspaces often fails when either sufficiently large e g   there large component outliers
paper two goals
first one show order significantly improve robustness outliers noise flats algorithm sufficient replace its objective function eq \eqref{eq:objective_kflats} \sum_{i=1}^k \min_{d-\text{flats } l_i} \sum_{\bx_j \cx_i} \dist(\bx_j,l_i)\ replacing average average
second goal establish online algorithm purpose so data supplied incrementally one point at time incrementally produce corresponding output
believe online procedure very different than flats also beneficial standard settings moderate-size data not streaming
indeed possible strategy will converge more often global minimum error than straightforward generalization flats assuming accurate algorithm computing best flats
order address those goals propose median flats mkf algorithm
chose name since special case where well-known medians algorithm see eg   approximates minimum same energy function
mkf algorithm employs stochastic gradient descent strategy order provide online approximation best flats
its current implementation only applies setting underlying linear subspaces not general affine ones
numerical experiments synthetic real data indicate superior performance mkf algorithm various instances
particular outperforms some standard algorithms cases large outlier component relatively large intrinsic dimension flats
even hopkins 155 database motion segmentation  requires small intrinsic dimensions little noise few outliers mkf performs very well particular better than flats
speculate because iterative process mkf converges more often global minimum than flats
rest paper organized follows

section carefully tests algorithm both artificial data synthetic hybrid linear models real data motion segmentation video sequences
