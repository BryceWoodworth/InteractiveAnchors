 introduction 
vast majority currently available data analysis methods based vector model observations described fixed number real values i e  vectors fixed finite dimensional vector space
unfortunately many real world data depart strongly model
quite common instance variable size data
they natural example online handwriting recognition where representation character drawn user vary length because drawing conditions
other data texts instance strongly non numerical complex internal structure: they very difficult represent accurately vector space
while lot work been done adapt classical data analysis methods structured data tree graph neural based unsupervised processing structured data also } well data varying size there still strong need efficient flexible data analysis methods applied any type data
way design methods rely one one comparison between observations
general possible define similarity dissimilarity measure between arbitrary data long comparing them meaningful
general data analysis algorithms based solely dis)similarities between observations more complex than their vector counterparts but they universal therefore applied any kind data
moreover they allow one rely specific dis)similarities constructed experts rather than vector representation data induces general unwanted distortion observations
many algorithms been adapted use solely dissimilarities between data
clustering field k-means algorithm been adapted dissimilarity data under name partitioning around medoids
more recently approaches based deterministic annealing been used propose another class extensions k-means principle
following path taken k-means several adaptation kohonen's self-organizing map dissimilarity data been proposed
proposed probabilistic formulation som used directly dissimilarity data
deterministic annealing schemes been also used som
present paper focus adaptation proposed  where was applied successfully protein sequence clustering visualization problem well string clustering problems
generalization called dissimilarity som dsom also known median som considered som formulation pam method
variants dsom were applied temperature time series  spectrometric data web usage data
major drawback dsom its running time very high especially when compared standard vector som
well known som algorithm behaves linearly number input data
contrary dsom behaves quadratically number see section 
propose paper several modifications basic algorithm allow much faster implementation
quadratic nature algorithm cannot avoided essentially because dissimilarity data intrinsically described quadratic number one one dissimilarities
nevertheless standard dsom algorithm cost proportional  where number observations number clusters algorithm produce whereas our modifications lead cost proportional
moreover specific implementation strategy reduces actual computation burden even more
important property all our modifications obtained algorithm produces exactly same results standard dsom algorithm
paper organized follows
section recall som adaptation dissimilarity data obtain theoretical cost dsom
section  describe our proposed new algorithm well implementation techniques decrease its running time practice
finally evaluate algorithm section
evaluation validates theoretical cost model shows implementation methods reduce running time
