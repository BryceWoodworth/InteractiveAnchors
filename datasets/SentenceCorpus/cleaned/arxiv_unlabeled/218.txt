 
wide variety regularization methods algorithms computing entire solution path been developed recently
solution path algorithms do not only compute solution one particular value regularization parameter but entire path solutions making selection optimal parameter much easier
most currently used algorithms not robust sense they cannot deal general degenerate input
here present new robust generic method parametric quadratic programming
our algorithm directly applies nearly all machine learning applications where so far every application required its own different algorithm
illustrate usefulness our method applying very low rank problem could not solved existing path tracking methods namely compute part-worth values choice based conjoint analysis popular technique market research estimate consumers preferences class parameterized options
 introduction 
study combinatorial algorithm solve parameterized quadratic programs i e  compute whole solution path
unlike other methods employed machine learning our algorithm deal singular objective function matrices without perturbing input
regularization methods resulting parametrized quadratic programs successfully been applied many optimization classification regression tasks variety areas example signal processing statistics biology surface reconstruction information retrieval
will briefly review some applications here will also study another application namely choice based conjoint analysis more detail
conjoint analysis comprises popular family techniques mostly used market research assess consumers' preferences set options specified multiple parameters see overview recent developments
will show regularization approach analysis preference data leads parameterized quadratic program sparse low rank positive semi-definite matrix describing quadratic term objective function
