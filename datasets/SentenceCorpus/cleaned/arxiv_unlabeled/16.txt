 
solomonoff completed bayesian framework providing rigorous unique formal universal choice model class prior
discuss breadth how sense universal non iid \ sequence prediction solves various philosophical problems traditional bayesian sequence prediction
show solomonoff's model possesses many desirable properties: fast convergence strong bounds contrast most classical continuous prior densities no zero p(oste)rior problem ie \ confirm universal hypotheses reparametrization regrouping invariant avoids old-evidence updating problem
even performs well actually better non-computable environments
 introduction 
given weather past what probability rain tomorrow
what correct answer iq test asking continue sequence 1,4,9,16
given historic stock-charts one predict quotes tomorrow
assuming sun rose 5000 years every day how likely doomsday sun does not rise tomorrow
instances important problem inductive inference time-series forecasting sequence prediction
finding prediction rules every particular new problem possible but cumbersome prone disagreement contradiction
what interested formal general theory prediction
bayesian framework most consistent successful framework developed thus far
bayesian considers set environments=\-hypotheses=\-models includes true data generating probability distribution
one's prior belief environment observed data sequence  bayes' rule yields one's posterior confidence
predictive setting one directly determines predictive probability next without intermediate step identifying true good causal useful model
note classification regression regarded special sequence prediction problems where sequence pairs given class label function value shall predicted
bayesian framework leaves open how choose model class prior
general guidelines should small but large enough contain true environment  should reflect one's prior subjective belief should non-informative neutral objective if no prior knowledge available
but informal ambiguous considerations outside formal bayesian framework
solomonoff's rigorous essentially unique formal universal solution problem consider single large universal class suitable all induction problems
corresponding universal prior biased towards simple environments way dominates=\-superior all other priors
leads priori probability equivalent probability universal turing machine random input tape outputs
many interesting important deep results been proven solomonoff's universal distribution
motivation goal paper provide broad discussion how sense universal sequence prediction solves all kinds philosophical problems bayesian sequence prediction present some recent results
many arguments ideas could further developed
i hope exposition stimulates future more detailed investigation
section review excellent predictive performance bayesian sequence prediction generic non iid \ countable continuous model classes
section critically reviews classical principles indifference symmetry minimax obtaining objective priors introduces universal prior inspired occam's razor quantified terms kolmogorov complexity
section iid \  section universal  show various desirable properties universal prior class non-zero p(oste)rior confirmation universal hypotheses reparametrization regrouping invariance no old-evidence updating problem contrast most classical continuous prior densities
finally show universal mixture performs better than classical continuous mixtures even uncomputable environments
