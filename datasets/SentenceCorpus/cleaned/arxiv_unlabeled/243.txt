 
problem classifying sonar signals rocks mines first studied gorman sejnowski become benchmark against many learning algorithms been tested
discovered both training set test set benchmark linearly separable although different hyperplanes
moreover complete set learning test patterns together also linearly separable
give weights separate sets may used compare results found other algorithms
 introduction 
become current practice test performance learning algorithms \textsl{realistic} benchmark problems
underlying difficulty tests general problems not well caracterized making thus impossible decide whether better solution one already found exists
sonar signals classification benchmark introduced gorman et al widely used test machine learning algorithms
problem classifier discriminate if given sonar return was produced metal cylinder cylindrically shaped rock same environment
benchmark contains 208 preprocessed sonar spectra defined real values their corresponding class
among patterns usually used determine classifier parameters through procedure called learning
then classifier used class remaining patterns fraction misclassified patterns used estimate generalization error produced learning algorithm
applied monoplane neural incremental learning algorithm benchmark
algorithm hidden units included one after other until number training errors vanishes
each hidden unit simple binary perceptron trained learning algorithm minimerror
