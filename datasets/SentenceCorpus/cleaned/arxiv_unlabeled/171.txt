 
many databases store data relational format different types entities information about links between entities
field statistical-relational learning srl developed number new statistical models data
paper focus learning class-level first-order dependencies model general database statistics over attributes linked objects links e g  percentage grades given computer science classes
class-level statistical relationships important themselves they support applications like policy making strategic planning query optimization
most current srl methods find class-level dependencies but their main task support instance-level predictions about attributes links specific entities
focus only class-level prediction describe algorithms learning class-level models orders magnitude faster task
our algorithms learn bayes nets relational structure leveraging efficiency single-table nonrelational bayes net learners
evaluation our methods three data sets shows they computationally feasible realistic table sizes learned structures represent statistical information databases well
after learning compiles database statistics into bayes net querying statistics via bayes net inference faster than sql queries does not depend size database
 introduction 
many real-world applications store data relational format different tables entities their links
standard machine learning techniques applied data stored single table nonrelational propositional ``flat" format
field statistical-relational learning srl aims extend machine learning algorithms relational data
one major machine learning tasks use data build generative statistical model variables application domain
single-table learning setting goal often represent predictive dependencies between attributes single individual e g  between intelligence ranking student
srl setting goal often represent addition dependencies between attributes different individuals related linked each other e g  between intelligence student difficulty course given student registered course
