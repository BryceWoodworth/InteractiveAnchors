 introduction 
hidden markov models hmm's workhorse modern statistics machine learning applications ranging speech recognition biological sequence alignment pattern classification
hmm defines joint distribution over sequence states   observations  whereby states form markov chain observations conditionally independent given sequence states
formulae } most fundamental algorithmic task related hmm's arguably problem inferring sequence states observations
conditional distribution state sequence given observations bayes theorem } where thought normalization constant
state sequence then estimated sequence most likely states maximum posteriori probability map estimation } reduces inference problem problem computing marginals
statistical physics point view  conditional distribution  regarded boltzmann distribution one dimensional system variables energy function } at temperature
sequence observations thus act quenched external field
suggested analogy marginals computed efficiently using transfer matrix algorithm
present context also known bahl-cocke-jelinek-raviv bcjr algorithm
bcjr algorithm complexity linear sequence length quadratic number states
more precisely complexity same multiplying matrix times vector
while easy simple models few states becomes intractable complex models
simple mechanism leading state space explosion presence memory underlying markov chain dependence each observation multiple states
all cases model reduced standard hmm via state space augmentation but augmented state space becomes exponential memory length
leads severe limitations tractable memory length
paper proposes several new algorithms addressing problem
our basic intuition when memory length gets large transfer matrix accurately approximated using mean field ideas
study proposed method concrete model used dna pyrosequencing
case one interested inferring underlying dna sequence absorption signal carries traces base type at several positions
effective memory length scales roughly square root sequence length thus making plain transfer matrix impractical
paper organized follows
next section will define concrete model study section describes connection dna pyrosequencing motivate
section describes transfer matrix algorithm several low complexity approximation schemes
after describing few bounds  numerical analytical results collected section \\
