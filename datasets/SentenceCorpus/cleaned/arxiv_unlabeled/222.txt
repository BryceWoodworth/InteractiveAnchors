 introduction 
sensory devices often receive signals multiple physical stimuli evolve simultaneously but unrelated one another
many situations necessary create separate representations one more stimuli blindly processing observed signals i e  processing them without prior knowledge nature stimuli
recent years there considerable progress solution ``blind source separation" bss problem special case signals source variables linearly related
however although nonlinear bss often performed effortlessly humans computational methods doing quite limited
consider time series data  where multiplet measurements  
usual objectives nonlinear bss are: 1 determine if data instantaneous mixtures statistically independent source components } where possibly nonlinear invertible mixing function; 2 if case compute mixing function
other words problem find coordinate transformation transforms observed data measurement-defined coordinate system   state space special source coordinate system   components transformed data statistically independent
let state space probability density function pdf source coordinate system defined so fraction total time source trajectory located within volume element at location
usual formulation bss problem source components required statistically independent sense their state space pdf product density functions individual components } every formulation bss multiple solutions created permutations component-wise transformations any one solution
however well known criterion  so weak suffers much worse non-uniqueness problem: namely form bss problem multiple solutions created transformations mix source variables see references therein
issue non-uniqueness circumvented considering data's trajectory   instead i e  state space
first let pdf space defined so fraction total time location velocity source trajectory within volume element at location
earlier paper described formulation bss problem pdf was required product density functions individual components } separability stronger requirement than separability state space
see note  recovered integrating both sides  over all velocities but latter equation cannot deduced former one
fact shown  strong enough guarantee bss problem unique solution up permutations component-wise transformations
furthermore type statistical independence virtue being satisfied almost all classical physical systems composed non-interacting subsystems generators most signals interest
author previously demonstrated pdf time series induces riemannian geometry state space metric equal local second-order correlation matrix data's velocity
nonlinear bss performed computing metric coordinate system i e  computing second-order correlation at each point  well its first second derivatives respect
however although mathematically correct complete method solving nonlinear bss problem suffers practical difficulty: namely if dimensionality state space high great deal data required cover densely enough order calculate derivatives accurately
current paper shows how perform nonlinear bss computing higher-order local correlations data's velocity instead computing derivatives its second-order correlation
approach advantageous because requires much less data accurate computation
example synthetic speech separation experiment section iii new method separate two synthetic utterances recorded single microphone after minutes observation rather than hours observation required differential geometric method
method described paper differs significantly methods proposed other investigators because uses criterion statistical independence  instead state space
addition there technical differences between proposed method conventional ones
first all technique paper exploits statistical constraints data locally defined state space contrast usual criteria statistical independence global conditions data time series its time derivatives
furthermore unlike many other methods  mixing function derived constructive deterministic non-parametric manner without employing iterative algorithms without using probabilistic learning methods without parameterizing neural network architecture other means
addition proposed method handle any differentiable mixing function unlike some other techniques only apply restricted class mixing functions
next section describes how separate two-dimensional data into two one-dimensional source variables
section iii illustrates method using separate two simultaneous speech-like sounds recorded single microphone
implications work discussed last section
appendix describes how method generalized separate data arbitrary dimensionality into possibly multidimensional source variables
