 introduction 
suppose you given unknown quantum state drawn ensemble possible pure states where each state labeled after class originated
how well you predict class unknown state
general question often referred literature quantum state discrimination  been studied at least far back seminal work helstrom seventies field quantum detection estimation theory 
course answer will depend parameters structure your knowledge ensemble pure states dimension hilbert space quantum states live number copies unknown state you received
paper take machine learning ml view problem recasting learning task called quantum classification
our main goal doing so bring new ideas insights ml help solve task some its variants
other motivations include characterization learning tasks terms amount information needed complete them measured instance number copies quantum states development framework used relate compare tasks
approach performing learning quantum states was originally taken defined  where was illustrated giving explicit algorithm task quantum clustering  where goal group clusters quantum states similar using fidelity similarity measure while putting states dissimilar different clusters
model learning quantum states put forward paper complementary model proposed aaronson  where training dataset composed povm's  positive-operator valued measurement  not quantum states
aaronson's model receive finite number copies unknown quantum state goal ``training'' state few povm's produce high probability hypothesis generalize reasonable accuracy unobserved povm's belonging training dataset
outline paper follows
first model performing learning quantum world introduced section along notion learning reduction allows us relate together different learning tasks
afterwards section task binary classification described weighted multiclass versions task defined respectively sections
finally section concludes discussion
