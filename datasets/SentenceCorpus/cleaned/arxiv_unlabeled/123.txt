implies corresponding existence uniqueness result optimal algorithm halfspace learning when data target functions drawn uniform distribution
 introduction 
let unit sphere normalized uniform measure geodesic metric  let proper convex cone nonempty interior
will show function defined by% % attains its global minimum at unique point
while existence minimum straightforward uniqueness seems surprisingly difficult prove
similar problem been considered
works intention define centroid so integration replaced finite summation replaced
since problem rather obvious appears likely proof above result exists somewhere literature just haven't been able find
