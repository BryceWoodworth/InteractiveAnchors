 
consider design cognitive medium access control mac protocols enabling unlicensed secondary transmitter-receiver pair communicate over idle periods set licensed channels ie  primary network
objective maximize data throughput while maintaining synchronization between secondary users avoiding interference licensed primary users
no statistical information about primary traffic assumed available a-priori secondary user
investigate two distinct sensing scenarios
first secondary transmitter capable sensing all primary channels whereas senses one channel only second scenario
both cases propose mac protocols efficiently learn statistics primary traffic on-line
our simulation results demonstrate proposed blind protocols asymptotically achieve throughput obtained when prior knowledge primary traffic statistics available
 introduction 
most licensed spectrum resources under-utilized
observation encouraged emergence dynamic opportunistic spectrum access concepts where unlicensed secondary users equipped cognitive radios allowed opportunistically access spectrum long they do not interfere licensed primary users
achieve goal secondary users must monitor primary traffic order identify spectrum holes opportunities exploited transfer data
main goal cognitive mac protocol sense radio spectrum detect occupancy state different primary spectrum channels then opportunistically communicate over unused channels spectrum holes minimal interference primary users
specifically cognitive mac protocol should continuously make efficient decisions channels sense access order obtain most benefit available spectrum opportunities
several cognitive mac protocols been proposed previous studies
example  mac protocols were constructed assuming each secondary user equipped two transceivers control transceiver tuned dedicated control channel software defined radio sdr-based transceiver tuned any available channels sense receive transmit signals/packets
other hand proposed sensing-period optimization mechanism optimal channel-sequencing algorithm well environment adaptive channel-usage pattern estimation method
slotted markovian structure primary network traffic adopted here was also considered where optimal policy was characterized simple greedy policy secondary users was constructed
authors  however assumed primary traffic statistics i e  markov chain transition probabilities were available a-priori secondary users
here our focus blind scenario where cognitive mac protocol must learn transition probabilities on-line
work differentiate between two scenarios
first assumes secondary transmitter sense all available primary channels before making decision one access
secondary receiver however does not participate sensing process wait decode only one channel
model adopted
sequel propose efficient algorithm optimizes on-line learning capabilities secondary transmitter ensures perfect synchronization between secondary pair
proposed protocol does not assume separate control channel hence piggybacks synchronization information same data packet
our numerical results demonstrate superiority proposed protocol over one where primary transmitter receiver assumed access channel predetermined sequence they agreed upon a-priori
second scenario assumes both secondary transmitter receiver sense only one primary channel each time slot
problem re-casted restless multi-armed bandit problem where optimal algorithm must strike balance between exploration exploitation
unfortunately finding optimal solution problem remains elusive task
inspired recent results  efficient mac protocol constructed viewed whittle index strategy augmented similar learning phase one proposed multi-armed bandit scenario
our numerical results show performance protocol converges whittle index strategy known transition probabilities
