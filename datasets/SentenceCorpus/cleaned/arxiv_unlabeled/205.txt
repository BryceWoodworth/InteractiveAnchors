 introduction 
while expanding universe products available via internet commerce provides consumers valuable options sifting through numerous alternatives identify desirable choices challenging
collaborative filtering cf systems aid process recommending users products desired similar individuals
at heart cf system algorithm predicts whether given user will like various products based his past behavior other users
nearest neighbor nn algorithms example enjoyed wide use commercial cf systems including those amazon netflix youtube
prototypical nn algorithm stores each user's history may include instance his product ratings purchase decisions
predict whether particular user will like particular product algorithm identifies number other users similar histories
prediction then generated based how so-called neighbors responded product
prediction could example weighted average past ratings supplied neighbors
because purchase decisions influenced cf systems they become targets manipulation unscrupulous vendors
instance vendor create multiple online identities use each rate his own product highly competitors' products poorly
example amazon's cf system was manipulated so users who viewed spiritual guide written well-known christian evangelist were subsequently recommended sex manual gay men
although incident may not been driven commercial motives highlights vulnerability cf systems
research literature offers further empirical evidence nn algorithms susceptible manipulation
order curb manipulation one might consider authenticating each user asking say credit card number limit number fake identities
may effective some situations
however web services do not facilitate financial transactions youtube requiring authentication would intrude privacy drive users away
one might also consider using only customer purchase data when they available basis recommendations because they likely generated honest users
recommendation quality may improved however if higher-volume data page views also properly utilized
paper seek understand extent manipulators hurt performance cf systems how cf algorithms should designed abate their influence
find while nn algorithms quite sensitive manipulation cf algorithms carry out predictions based particular class probabilistic models surprisingly robust
reasons will explain paper will refer algorithms kind linear cf algorithms
find user rates increasing number products average accuracy predictions made linear cf algorithm becomes insensitive manipulated data
instance even if half all ratings provided manipulators who try promote half products predictions users long histories will barely distorted average
provide some intuition why our results should hold now offer informal argument
robust cf algorithm should learn its mistakes
particular differences between its predictions actual ratings should help improve predictions future ratings
linear cf algorithm generates predictions based probability distribution convex combination two distributions: one would learn given only data generated honest users one would learn given only manipulated data
user whose ratings wish predict provides more ratings becomes increasingly clear two distributions better represents his preferences
result weight placed manipulated data diminishes distortion vanishes
main theoretical result paper formalizes above argument
particular will define notion distortion induced manipulators establish upper bound distortion takes particularly simple form: r n n 80\% 10\% 75\% 21$ products before receiving recommendations
broaden scope our analysis will also study cf algorithms behave like linear cf algorithms asymptotically size training set grows
class algorithms refer asymptotically linear  more flexible accommodating modeling assumptions may improve prediction accuracy
will establish relaxed version our distortion bound linear cf algorithms applies asymptotically linear cf algorithms
will also show our distortion bound does not generally hold nn algorithms
intuitively because prediction errors do not always improve selection neighbors
particular user provides more ratings manipulated data contribute inaccurate predictions his future ratings may remain set neighbors while data generated honest users may eliminated
result distortion predictions may not decrease
will later provide example illustrate
addition theoretical results paper provides empirical analysis using publicly available set movie ratings generated users netflix's recommendation system
produce distorted version data set injecting manipulated ratings generated using manipulation technique studied prior literature
then compare results application three cf algorithms: nn algorithm linear cf algorithm called kernel density estimation algorithm asymptotically linear cf algorithm called naive bayes algorithm
results demonstrate while performance nn algorithm highly susceptible manipulation those kernel density estimation naive bayes algorithms relatively robust
particular latter two experience distortion lower than theoretical bound provide whereas distortion former exceeds far
one might also wonder whether manipulation robustness cf algorithm comes at expense its prediction accuracy
example consider algorithm fixes predictions all ratings constant without regard training data
algorithm uninfluenced manipulation but likely yield poor predictions therefore not useful
our experiments accuracy demonstrated three algorithms all seems reasonable
suggests accuracy cf algorithm may achieved alongside robustness
our theoretical empirical results together suggest commercial recommendation systems using nn algorithms made more robust adopting approaches describe
note not proposing real-world systems should implement specific algorithms present paper
rather our analysis highlights properties cf algorithms lead robustness practitioners may benefit taking properties into consideration when designing cf systems
