using opinion spreading process similarity between any users obtained
algorithm remarkably higher accuracy than standard collaborative filtering cf using pearson correlation
furthermore introduce free parameter regulate contributions objects user-user correlations
numerical results indicate decreasing influence popular objects further improve algorithmic accuracy personality
argue better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation generate higher accuracy
accordingly further propose algorithm involving only top similar neighbors each target user both less computational complexity higher algorithmic accuracy \keywords{recommendation systems; bipartite network; collaborative filtering }
 introduction 
advent internet exponential growth world-wide-web routers confront people information overload
facing too much data able effectively filter out pieces information most appropriate us
promising way provide personal recommendations filter out information
recommendation systems use opinions users help them more effectively identify content interest potentially overwhelming set choices
motivated practical significance e-commerce society various kinds algorithms been proposed correlation-based methods  content-based methods  spectral analysis  principle component analysis  network-based methods  so
review current progress see ref
references therein
one most successful technologies recommendation systems called collaborative filtering cf been developed extensively investigated over past decade
when predicting potential interests given user approach first identifies set similar users past records then makes prediction based weighted combination those similar users' opinions
despite its wide applications collaborative filtering suffers several major limitations including system scalability accuracy
recently some physical dynamics including mass diffusion  heat conduction trust-based model  found their applications personal recommendations
physical approaches been demonstrated both high accuracy low computational complexity
however algorithmic accuracy computational complexity may very sensitive statistics data sets
example algorithm presented ref
runs much faster than standard cf if number users much larger than objects while when number objects huge advantage algorithm vanishes because its complexity mainly determined number objects see ref

order increase system scalability accuracy standard cf introduce network-based recommendation algorithm spreading activation namely sa-cf
addition two free parameters presented increase accuracy personality
