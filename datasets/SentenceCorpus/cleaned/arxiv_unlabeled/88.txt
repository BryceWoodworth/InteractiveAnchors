resulting prediction algorithm applied predict results football tennis matches
theoretical performance guarantee turns out rather tight data sets especially case more extensive tennis data
 introduction 
paradigm prediction expert advice was introduced late 1980s see eg     been applied various loss functions; see recent book-length review
especially important class loss functions ``mixable'' ones learner's loss made small best expert's loss plus constant depending number experts
known optimal additive constant attained ``strong aggregating algorithm'' proposed use adjective ``strong'' distinguish ``weak aggregating algorithm'' 
there several important loss functions been shown mixable optimal additive constant been found
prime examples case binary observations log loss function square loss function
log loss function whose mixability obvious been explored extensively along its important generalizations kullback--leibler divergence cover's loss function
paper concentrate square loss function
binary case its mixability was demonstrated
there two natural directions result could generalized: regression: observations real numbers square-loss regression standard problem statistics classification: observations take values finite set leads ``brier game'' defined below standard way measuring quality predictions meteorology other applied fields: see eg  
mixability square loss function case observations belonging bounded interval real numbers was demonstrated ; haussler et al 's algorithm was simplified
surprisingly case square-loss non-binary classification never been analysed framework prediction expert advice
purpose paper fill gap
