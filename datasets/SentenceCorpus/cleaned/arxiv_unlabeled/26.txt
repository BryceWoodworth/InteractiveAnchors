 introduction 
probabilistic grammatical inference often consider stochastic languages define distributions over  set all possible words over alphabet
general consider unknown distribution goal find good approximation given finite sample words independently drawn
class probabilistic automata pa often used modeling distributions
class same expressiveness hidden markov models identifiable limit
however there exists no efficient algorithm identifying pa
explained fact there exists no canonical representation automata makes difficult correctly identify structure target
one solution focus subclasses pa probabilistic deterministic automata but important lack expressiveness
another solution consists considering class multiplicity automata ma
models admit canonical representation offers good opportunities machine learning point view
ma define functions compute rational series values 
ma strict generalization pa stochastic languages generated pa special cases rational stochastic languages
let us denote class rational stochastic languages computed ma parameters where
 exactly class stochastic languages generated pa parameters
but when  obtain strictly greater classes
provides several advantages: elements minimal normal representation thus elements may significantly smaller representation ; parameters minimal representations directly related probabilities some natural events form  efficiently estimated stochastic samples; lastly when field rational series over form vector space efficient linear algebra techniques used deal rational stochastic languages
however class presents serious drawback: there exists no recursively enumerable subset class ma exactly generates
consequence no proper identification algorithm exist: indeed applying proper identification algorithm enumeration samples would provide enumeration class rational stochastic languages over
spite result there exists efficient algorithm dees able identify limit
but before reaching target dees produce ma do not define stochastic languages
however been shown probability one any rational stochastic language  if dees given input sufficiently large sample drawn according  dees outputs rational series converges absolutely 1
moreover converges 0 size increases
show ma belong broader class rational series call pseudo-stochastic rational languages
pseudo-stochastic rational language property defined any word
stochastic language associated way when sum absolutely convergent
first consequence when stochastic language
second consequence any rational stochastic language  if dees given input increasing samples drawn according  dees outputs pseudo-stochastic rational languages converges 0 size increases
aim paper twofold: provide theoretical study class pseudo-stochastic rational languages series experiments order compare performance dees two classical inference algorithms: alergia mdi
show class pseudo-stochastic rational languages decidable within polynomial time
provide algorithm used compute any ma computes
also show how possible simulate using automaton
show there exist pseudo-stochastic rational languages not rational
finally show undecidable whether two pseudo-stochastic rational languages define same stochastic language
carried out lot experiments show dees outperforms alergia mdi most cases
results were expected since alergia mdi not same theoretical expressiveness since dees aims at producing minimal representation target set ma significantly smaller than smaller equivalent pda if exists
paper organized follows
section 2 introduce some background about multiplicity automata rational series stochastic languages present algorithm dees
section 3 deals our study pseudo-rational stochastic languages
our experiments detailed section 4
