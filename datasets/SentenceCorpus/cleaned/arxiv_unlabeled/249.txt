proposed "entropy message passing"  emp  algorithm may viewed sum-product message passing over entropy semiring previously appeared automata theory
primary use emp compute entropy model
however emp also used compute expressions appear expectation maximization gradient descent algorithms
 introduction 
efficient marginalization multivariate function important many areas including signal processing artificial intelligence digital communications
when cycle-free factor graph representation function available then exact marginals computed sum-product message passing factor graph 
fact number well-known algorithms special cases sum-product message passing
"sum" "product" sum-product message passing may belong arbitrary commutative semiring 
paper propose use entropy semiring resulting algorithm will called "entropy message passing"  emp 
entropy semiring was introduced cortes et al compute relative entropy between probabilistic automata
paper translate ideas into language factor graphs message passing algorithms
primary use emp compute entropy model cycle-free factor graph fixed observations
main prior work subject hernando et al ; again main point present paper clarify generalize prior work reformulating terms sum-product message passing
however emp also used compute expressions appear expectation maximization gradient ascent algorithms  ; connection appears new
paper structured follows
section ii review sum-product message passing over commutative semiring
section iii introduce entropy semiring
emp algorithm described section iv mentioned applications described section v
