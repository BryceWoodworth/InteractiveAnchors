 introduction 
given set points  minimum enclosing ball meb ball smallest radius contains all points
problem finding meb arises application areas diverse data mining learning statistics computer graphics computational geometry
therefore efficient algorithms problem not only theoretical interest but also wide practical applicability
exact algorithms finding meb typically exponential dependence
example algorithm runs time makes inadmissible many practical applications; case linear svms data may million more dimensions
therefore there been significant interest finding approximation algorithms problem
state art approximation algorithms meb problem extensively use concept coresets
given  coreset property if smallest enclosing ball containing expanded factor  then resulting ball also contains
therefore locating coreset equivalent finding approximation algorithm meb problem
approximation guarantees algorithms multiplicative
briefly coreset built incrementally greedy fashion
at every iteration meb current candidate coreset built
if every point lies ball current solution then algorithm stops otherwise most violated point point furthest away current meb included candidate coreset iterations continue
best known algorithms family running time
contrast present new algorithm derived casting problem finding meb convex but non-smooth optimization problem
specializing general framework  our algorithm able achieve running time where upper bound norm points
also approximation guarantees our algorithm additive  given tolerance denoting optimal radius  our algorithm produces function whose value lies between
although two types approximation guarantees seem different simple argument section  show our algorithm also yields traditional scale-invariant multiplicative approximation effort
extend our analysis closely related minimum enclosing convex polytope mecp problem present new algorithm
before given set points  task here find smallest polytope given fixed shape encloses points
our setting translations magnifications allowed but rotations not allowed
present approximation algorithm where denotes number faces polytope
apply our algorithms two problems interest machine learning namely finding maximum margin hyperplane computing distance polytope origin
coreset algorithm first problem was proposed while second one was studied
both cases our algorithms require fewer number iterations yield better computational complexity bounds
our paper structured follows: section introduce notation briefly review some results convex duality present general framework
