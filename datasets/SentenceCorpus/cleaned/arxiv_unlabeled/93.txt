 introduction 
during last decade increasing attention been paid ontologies their role knowledge engineering
philosophical sense may refer ontology particular system categories accounting certain vision world
system does not depend particular language: aristotle's ontology always same independently language used describe
other hand its most prevalent use artificial intelligence ontology refers engineering artifact more precisely produced according principles ontological engineering  constituted specific vocabulary used describe certain reality plus set explicit assumptions regarding intended meaning vocabulary words
set assumptions usually form first-order logical theory where vocabulary words appear unary binary predicate names respectively called concepts relations
simplest case ontology describes hierarchy concepts related subsumption relationships; more sophisticated cases suitable axioms added order express other relationships between concepts constrain their intended interpretation
two readings ontology described above indeed related each other but order solve terminological impasse word conceptualization used refer philosophical reading appear following definition based : ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization domain interest
among other things definition emphasizes fact ontology specified language comes formal semantics
only using formal approach ontologies provide machine interpretable meaning concepts relations expected when using ontology-based approach
among formalisms proposed ontological engineering most currently used description logics dls
note dls decidable fragments first order logic fol incomparable horn clausal logic hcl regards expressive power semantics } ontology engineering notably its dl-based approach playing relevant role definition semantic web
semantic web vision world wide web enriched machine-processable information supports user his tasks
architecture semantic web shown figure
consists several layers each equipped ad-hoc mark-up language
particular design mark-up language ontological layer  owl} been based very expressive dl
whereas owl already undergoing standardization process at w3c debate around unified language rules still ongoing
proposals like swrl} extend owl constructs inspired horn clauses order meet primary requirement logical layer : 'to build rules top ontologies'
swrl intended bridge notorious gaps between dls hcl way similar spirit hybridization knowledge representation reasoning kr\&r systems log
generally speaking hybrid systems kr\&r systems constituted two more subsystems dealing distinct portions single knowledge base performing specific reasoning procedures
motivation investigating developing systems improve two basic features kr\&r formalisms namely representational adequacy deductive power  preserving other crucial feature i e decidability
particular combining dls hcl easily yield undecidability if interface between them not reduced
hybrid system log integrates \textsc{datalog} using concept assertions essentially type constraints variables
been very recently mentioned blueprint well-founded semantic web rule mark-up languages because its underlying form integration called safe  assures semantic computational advantages swrl  though more expressive than log  currently not assure
defining rules including ones semantic web been usually considered demanding task viewpoint knowledge engineering
often supported machine learning algorithms vary approaches
approach known under name inductive logic programming ilp seems promising case at hand due common roots logic programming
ilp been historically concerned rule induction examples background knowledge within representation framework hcl aim prediction
more recently ilp moved towards either different fol fragments e g  dls new learning goals e g  description
paper resort methodological apparatus ilp define general framework learning rules top ontologies semantic web within kr\&r framework log
framework proposed general sense valid whatever scope induction description vs prediction
sake illustration concentrate instantiation framework case description
paper organized follows
section introduces basic notions log
section defines framework learning rules log
section illustrates instantiation framework
section concludes paper final remarks
clarifies links between owl dls
