many cases witnessed pioneering works cobb douglas functions were information quantities tailored economic theories ie they were built fit economic phenomena
paper look at functions complementary side: information
use recent toolbox built top vast class distortions coined bregman whose application field rivals metrics' various subfields mathematics
toolbox makes possible find quality aggregator consumptions prices labor capital wages etc  standpoint information carries
prove rather striking result
informational standpoint well-known economic aggregators do belong optimal set
common economic assumptions enter analysis large set shrinks essentially ends up exactly fitting either ces cobb-douglas both
summarize relevant economic contexts one could not crafted better some aggregator information standpoint
also discuss global economic behaviors optimal information aggregators general present brief panorama links between economic information aggregators \\ keywords : economic aggregators ces cobb-douglas bregman divergences
 introduction 
since end xix century birth ``neo-classical'' school mathematics played growing role economics
works l\'eon walras question aggregation behavior many individuals risen become central economic theory
order represent well possible evolution aggregate variables some mathematical functions been proposed become very famous economic literature
one most famous neo-classical function cobb-douglas
function particular interest since allows perfect substitutability between different inputs depends
another well-known ``linear'' function was later formulated leontief  inputs conversely complementary
choice function describe production process very strong implications at macroeconomic level illustrated many results found keynesians economics literature growth theory
but beyond different aggregate functions one most recently built well-known one constant elasticity substitution ces function elaborated arrow et al
indeed cobb-douglas production function elasticity substitution capital labor fixed unity
implies one percent increase capital stock implies equal one percent fall labor inputs order maintain constant production level given structure relative prices
contrary ces function allows elasticity lie between zero infinity but stay fixed at number along across isoquants whatever quantities inputs used production process
main advantage exhibited ces function encompasses cobb-douglas leontief linear production functions fact limit thus particular cases
nevertheless one reasons economists kept using simpler functions cobb-douglas one heavy calculus ces function often leads especially at point where models closed
seminal work douglas highlights importance progresses field statistical information genesis his essay
pioneering works cobb douglas  arrow et al  underline inductive nature inception their respective functions purpose was fit best possible information quantities aggregators observed economic phenomena
paper take deductive route paved rigorous information material derive fundamental quantities based two assumptions: aggregator should always informative possible respect data summarizes prices consumptions wages capital labor etc ; aggregator might require satisfy standard economic assumptions relying aggregator dualities prices / consumptions wages / labor etc  elasticities marginal rates substitutions returns scale etc
starting point our work class distortions coined sixties bregman  context convex programming
though they were born four decades ago was only much later distortions literally spread out other fields including statistics signal processing classification  fields where they had become undeniably central
was even later was discovered their broad applicability axiomatization makes possible relate them metrics their spawns
very roughly bregman divergences non-negative functions meet same identity indiscernibles condition metrics rely third assumption about existence particular aggregator minimizes total distortion set
last condition rephrased maximum likelihood condition makes aggregator most informative quantity about data call low distortion aggregator lda
paper our contribution threefold
first make clear partition economic aggregators respect information show some ldas ces cobb-douglas some limit cases ldas leontief some neither mitscherlich-spillman-von th{\"u}nen
without more assumptions set all ldas huge yet show global trends economic relevance easily shown all marginal rates substitution set quite easily drilled down aggregators general behaviors concavity convexity
fact our last contribution
our main contribution show when plug various standard economic assumptions see above set all ldas reduces particular subset precisely matches ces cobb-douglas both sets
novel advocacy use popular aggregators brings very strong information-theoretic rationale their ``economic'' existence
remaining paper structured follows
section 2 presents ldas their main properties
section 3 relate common economic aggregators ldas
section 4 discusses additional properties ldas
last section concludes paper avenues future research
order not laden paper's body all proofs been postponed appendix
