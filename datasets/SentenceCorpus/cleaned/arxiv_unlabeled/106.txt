 introduction 
let set symmetric function satisfies any any : k \inph{\cdot,\cdot}{\hcal} \phi:\xcal\rightarrowsymbol x,x'\insymbol k$ through  because they only access data through inner products hence through kernel
``kernel trick'' allows example perform supervised classification regression strings graphs state-of-the-art statistical methods soon positive definite kernel strings graphs defined
unsurprisingly triggered lot activity focused design specific positive definite kernels specific data strings graphs applications bioinformatics natural language processing
motivated applications computational chemistry proposed recently kernel labeled graphs more generally structured data decomposed into subparts
kernel called optimal assignment kernel  measures similarity between two data points performing optimal matching between subparts both points
translates natural notion similarity between graphs efficiently computed hungarian algorithm
however show below general not positive definite suggests special care may needed before using kernel methods
should pointed out not being positive definite not necessarily big issue use kernel practice
first may fact positive definite when restricted particular set data used practical experiment
second other non positive definite kernels sigmoid kernel been shown very useful efficient combination kernel methods
third practitioners kernel methods developed variety strategies limit possible dysfunction kernel methods when non positive definite kernels used projecting gram matrix pairwise kernel values set positive semidefinite matrices before processing
good results reported several chemoinformatics benchmark indeed confirm usefulness method
hence our message note certainly not criticize use optimal assignment kernel context kernel methods
instead wish warn some cases negative eigenvalues may appear gram matrix specific care may needed simultaneously contribute limitation error propagation scientific litterature
