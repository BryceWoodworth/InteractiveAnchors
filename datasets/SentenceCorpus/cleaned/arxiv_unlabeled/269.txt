 introduction 
learning streaming model poses restriction constrained both terms time well storage
scenarios quite common example cases analyzing network traffic data when data arrives streamed fashion at very high rate
streaming model also applies cases disk-resident large datasets cannot stored memory
unfortunately standard learning algorithms do not scale well cases
address scenarios propose applying stream model computation supervised learning problems
stream model allowed only one pass small number passes over ordered data set polylogarithmic storage polylogarithmic computation per element
