 introduction 
asset pricing models often describe arrival novel information jump process but characteristics underlying jump process only coarsely if at all related underlying source information
similarly time series models arch garch been developed forecast volatility using asset returns data but methods also ignore one key source market volatility: financial news
our objective here show text classification techniques allow much more refined analysis impact news asset prices
empirical studies examine stock return predictability traced back among others who showed there no significant autocorrelation daily returns thirty stocks dow-jones industrial average
similar studies were conducted  who find significant autocorrelation squared absolute returns i e volatility
effects also observed intraday volatility patterns demonstrated absolute returns
findings tend demonstrate given solely historical stock returns future stock returns not predictable while volatility
impact news articles also been studied extensively
example studied price fluctuations interest rate foreign exchange futures markets following macroeconomic announcements showed prices mostly adjusted within one minute major announcements
aggregated daily announcements dow jones \& company into single variable found no correlation market absolute returns weak correlation firm-specific absolute returns
however aggregated intraday news concerning companies listed australian stock exchange into exogenous variable garch model found significant predictive power
findings attributed conditioning volatility news
results were further improved restricting type news articles included
most common techniques forecasting volatility often based autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity arch generalized arch garch models mentioned above
example intraday volatility foreign exchange equity markets modeled ma-garch arch
see survey arch garch models various other applications
machine learning techniques neural networks support vector machines also been used forecast volatility
neural networks used forecast implied volatility options sp100 index support vector machines used forecast volatility sp500 index using daily returns
here show information press releases used predict intraday abnormal returns relatively high accuracy
consistent  however direction returns not found predictable
form text classification problem where press releases labeled positive if absolute return jumps at some fixed time after news made public
support vector machines svm used solve classification problem using both equity returns word frequencies press releases
furthermore use multiple kernel learning mkl optimally combine equity returns text predictive features increase classification performance
text classification well-studied problem machine learning  among many others show svm significantly outperform classic methods naive bayes
initially naive bayes classifiers were used do three-class classification index using daily returns labels
news taken several sources reuters wall street journal
five-class classification naive bayes classifiers used classify intraday price trends when articles published at yahoo
finance website
support vector machines were also used classify intraday price trends using reuters articles do four-class classification stock returns using press releases prnewswire
text classification also been used directly predict volatility see survey trading systems use text
recently used svm predict if articles bloomberg service followed abnormally large volatility; articles deemed important then aggregated into variable used garch model similar
use support vector regression svr forecast stock return volatility based text sec mandated 10-k reports
they found reports published after sarbanes-oxley act 2002 improved forecasts over baseline methods did not use text
generating trading rules genetic programming gp another way incorporate text financial trading systems
trading rules created using gp foreign exchange markets based technical indicators extended combine technical indicators non-publicly available information
ensemble methods were used top gp create rules based headlines posted yahoo internet message boards
our contribution here twofold
first abnormal returns predicted using text classification techniques similar
given press release predict whether not abnormal return will occur next minutes using text past absolute returns
algorithm uses text predict whether returns jump up 3\% down 3\% remain within bounds ``unclear'' within 15 minutes press release
they consider nine months subset eight years press releases used here
our experiments analyze predictability absolute returns at many horizons demonstrate significant initial intraday predictability decreases throughout trading day
second optimally combine text information asset price time series significantly enhance classification performance using multiple kernel learning mkl
use analytic center cutting plane method accpm solve resulting mkl problem
accpm particularly efficient problems where objective function gradient hard evaluate but whose feasible set simple enough so analytic centers computed efficiently
furthermore because does not suffer conditioning issues accpm achieve higher precision targets than other first-order methods
rest paper organized follows
section details text classification problem solve here provides predictability results using using either text absolute returns features
section describes multiple kernel learning framework details analytic center cutting plane algorithm used solve resulting optimization problem
finally use mkl enhance prediction performance
