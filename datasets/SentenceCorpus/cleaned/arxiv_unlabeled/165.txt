paper proposes method construct adaptive agent universal respect given class experts where each expert agent been designed specifically particular environment
adaptive control problem formalized problem minimizing relative entropy adaptive agent expert most suitable unknown environment
if agent passive observer then optimal solution well-known bayesian predictor
however if agent active then its past actions need treated causal interventions i/o stream rather than normal probability conditions
here shown solution new variational problem given stochastic controller called bayesian control rule implements adaptive behavior mixture experts
furthermore shown under mild assumptions bayesian control rule converges control law most suitable expert
 introduction 
when behavior environment under any control signal fully known then designer choose agent produces desired dynamics
instances problem include hitting target cannon under known weather conditions solving maze having its map controlling robotic arm manufacturing plant
however when behavior plant unknown then designer faces problem adaptive control
example shooting cannon lacking appropriate measurement equipment finding way out unknown maze designing autonomous robot martian exploration
adaptive control turns out far more difficult than its non-adaptive counterpart
because any good policy carefully trade off explorative versus exploitative actions i e actions identification environment's dynamics versus actions control desired way
even when environment's dynamics known belong particular class optimal agents available constructing corresponding optimal adaptive agent general computationally intractable even simple toy problems
thus finding tractable approximations been major focus research
recently been proposed reformulate problem statement some classes control problems based minimization relative entropy criterion
example large class optimal control problems solved very efficiently if problem statement reformulated minimization deviation dynamics controlled system uncontrolled system
work similar approach introduced
if class agents given where each agent solves different environment then adaptive controllers derived minimum relative entropy principle
particular one construct adaptive agent universal respect class minimizing average relative entropy environment-specific agent
however extension not straightforward
there syntactical difference between actions observations taken into account when formulating variational problem
more specifically actions treated interventions obeying rules causality
if distinction made variational problem unique solution given stochastic control rule called bayesian control rule
control rule particularly interesting because translates adaptive control problem into on-line inference problem applied forward time
furthermore work shows under mild assumptions adaptive agent converges environment-specific agent
paper organized follows
section introduces notation sets up adaptive control problem

after initial na\"{\i}ve approach need causal considerations motivated
then bayesian control rule derived revised relative entropy criterion
section conditions convergence examined proof given
section illustrates usage bayesian control rule multi-armed bandit problem undiscounted markov decision problem
section discusses properties bayesian control rule relates previous work literature
section concludes
