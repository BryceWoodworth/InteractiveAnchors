sty file sample compression conjecture littlestone \& warmuth remained unsolved over two decades
while maximum classes concept classes meeting sauer's lemma equality compressed compression general concept classes reduces compressing maximal classes classes cannot expanded without increasing vc-dimension
two promising ways forward are: embedding maximal classes into maximum classes at most polynomial increase vc dimension compression via operating geometric representations
paper presents positive results latter approach first negative result former through systematic investigation finite maximum classes
simple arrangements hyperplanes hyperbolic space shown represent maximum classes generalizing corresponding euclidean result
show sweeping generic hyperplane across arrangements forms unlabeled compression scheme size vc dimension corresponds special case peeling one-inclusion graph resolving recent conjecture kuzmin \& warmuth
bijection between finite maximum classes certain arrangements piecewise-linear pl hyperplanes either ball euclidean space established
finally show maximum classes corresponding pl hyperplane arrangements cubical complexes homeomorphic ball equivalently complexes manifolds boundary
main result pl arrangements swept moving hyperplane unlabeled compress any finite maximum class forming peeling scheme conjectured kuzmin \& warmuth
corollary some maximal classes cannot embedded into any maximum class vc dimension  any constant
construction pl sweeping involves pachner moves one-inclusion graph corresponding moves hyperplane across intersection other hyperplanes
extends well known pachner moves triangulations cubical complexes
 introduction 
\term{maximum} concept classes largest cardinality possible their given vc dimension
classes particular interest their special recursive structure underlies all general sample compression schemes known to-date
structure admits many elegant geometric algebraic topological representations upon paper focuses
introduced study \term{sample compression schemes} defined pair mappings given concept class : \term{compression function} mapping labeled sample subsequence labeled examples \term{reconstruction} \term{function} mapping subsequence concept consistent entire sample
compression scheme bounded size---the maximum cardinality subsequence image---was shown imply learnability
converse---that classes vc dimension admit compression schemes size become one oldest unsolved problems actively pursued within learning theory
interest conjecture been motivated its interpretation converse existence compression bounds pac learnable classes  basis practical machine learning methods compression schemes  conjecture's connection deeper understanding combinatorial properties concept classes
recently achieved compression maximum classes without use labels
they also conjectured their elegant min-peeling algorithm constitutes unlabeled compression scheme maximum classes
discussed our previous work  maximum classes fruitfully viewed \term{cubical complexes}
also topological spaces each cube equipped natural topology open sets its standard embedding into euclidean space
proved maximum classes correspond \term{ contractible complexes}---topological spaces identity map homotopic constant map---extending result maximum classes trees one-inclusion graphs
peeling viewed special form contractibility maximum classes
however there many non-maximum contractible cubical complexes cannot peeled demonstrates peelability reflects more detailed structure maximum classes than given contractibility alone
paper approach peeling direction simple hyperplane arrangement representations maximum classes
predicted maximum classes corresponding simple linear hyperplane arrangements could unlabeled compressed sweeping generic hyperplane across arrangement concepts min-peeled their corresponding cell swept away
positively resolve first part conjecture show sweeping arrangements corresponds new form \term{corner-peeling} prove distinct min-peeling
while \term{min-peeling} removes minimum degree concepts one-inclusion graph corner-peeling peels vertices contained unique cubes maximum dimension
explore simple hyperplane arrangements hyperbolic geometry show correspond set maximum classes properly containing those represented simple linear euclidean arrangements
classes again corner-peeled sweeping
citing proof existence maximum unlabeled compression schemes due  ask whether unlabeled compression schemes infinite classes positive half spaces constructed explicitly
present constructions illustrative but simpler classes suggesting there many interesting infinite maximum classes admitting explicit compression schemes under appropriate conditions sweeping infinite euclidean hyperbolic pl arrangements corresponds compression corner-peeling
next prove all maximum classes represented simple arrangements piecewise-linear pl hyperplanes ball
extends previous work viewing simple pl hyperplane arrangements maximum classes
close relationship between arrangements their hyperbolic versions suggests they could equivalent
resolving main problem left open preliminary version paper  show sweeping contractible pl arrangements does compress all finite maximum classes corner-peeling completing
show one-inclusion graph represented contractible pl hyperplane arrangement if only if strongly contractible cubical complex
motivates nomenclature contractible class arrangements pl hyperplanes
note then one-inclusion graphs admit corner-peeling scheme same size largest dimension cube
moreover if graph admits corner-peeling scheme then contractible cubical complex
give simple example show there one-inclusion graphs admit corner-peeling schemes but not strongly contractible so not represented contractible pl hyperplane arrangement
compressing \term{maximal classes}---classes cannot grown without increase their vc dimension---is sufficient compressing all classes embedded classes trivially inherit compression schemes their super-classes
reasoning motivates attempt embed maximal classes into maximum classes
present non-embeddability results following our earlier counter-examples kuzmin \& warmuth's minimum degree conjecture  our new results corner-peeling
explore examples maximal classes compressed but not peeled classes not strongly contractible but compressed
finally investigate algebraic topological properties maximum classes
most notably characterize maximum classes corresponding simple linear euclidean arrangements cubical complexes homeomorphic ball
result classes' boundaries homeomorphic sphere begins study boundaries maximum classes closely related peeling
conclude several open problems
