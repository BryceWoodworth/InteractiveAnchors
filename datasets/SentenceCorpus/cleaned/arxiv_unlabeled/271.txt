 introduction 
estimation time delay  delay between arrival times two signals originate same source but travel along different paths observer real-world problem astronomy
time series analysed could instance represent repeated measurement over many months years flux radiation optical light radio waves very distant quasar very bright source light usually few billion light-years away
some quasars appear set multiple nearby images sky due fact trajectory light coming source gets bent passes massive galaxy way ``lens'' result observer receives light various directions resulting detection several images
phenomenon called gravitational lensing natural consequence prediction general theory relativity postulates massive objects distort space-time thus cause bending trajectories light rays passing near them
quasars variable sources same sequence variations detected at different times different images according travel time along various paths
time delay between signals depends mass lens thus most direct method measure distribution matter universe often dark
scenario underlying pattern time emitted flux intensities quasar gets delayed corrupted all kinds noise processes
example astronomical time series not only corrupted observational noise but they also typically irregularly sampled possibly large observational gaps missing data
due practical limitations observation equipment availability weather conditions brightness moon among many other factors
over hundred systems lensed quasars currently known about 10 been monitored long periods some cases measurement time delay been claimed
here focus q0957+561 first multiply-imaged quasar discovered
source pair images here referred b been monitored over twenty years despite numerous claims universally agreed value time delay system not emerged
earlier paper presented analysis repeated radio observations along simulated data generated according properties observations  show kernel-based approach improve upon currently popular methods estimating time delays real astronomical data
more common form observations however employs optical telescopes monitoring known multiply-imaged sources observations inherent problems require modification our previous approach
here present largely modified approach outperforms optical datasets our previous appraoch well alternative approaches use astrophysics
here introduce novel evolutionary algorithm ea estimate parameters model-based method time delay estimation
ea uses fitness function mean squared error mse  given cross-validation observed data also performs novel regularisation procedure based singular value decomposition svd
our population also represented mixed types integers reals
contribution paper several directions: i evolutionary algorithm been introduced form novel hybridisation our kernel method ii principled automatic method been proposed estimate time delay kernel width svd regularisation parameters iii application ea driven model based formulation real-world problem iv carefully study statistical significance results different data
our ea evolutionary optimisation technique presence uncertainties missing data mixed representation  through two linked populations each devoted one particular data type
parameters optimise come kernel machine
do parameter optimisation model selection at same time
approach applied other problems not only time series gravitational lensing
instance missing data problems cover those cases where instrumental equipment fails observations incorrectly recorded sociological factors involved etc
therefore data unevenly sampled restricts use fourier analysis \s13 8
problems noisy missing data occur almost all sciences where data availability influenced what easy feasible collect e g  see 
compare performance our ea several ways: performance our method assessed against two most popular methods astrophysical literature  i e  {(a)} dispersion spectra method {(b)} scheme based structure function intrinsic variability source here referred prh method
because true time delay observed fluxes quasars not known assess performance algorithms controlled series experiments where artificially generated data known delays used
employ three kinds artificial data sets: large scale data  prh data wiener data outlined 
justify our ea analogous non-evolutionary model-based approach k-v also employed paper
our statistical analysis shows results our ea more accurate significant than state-of-the-art methods
use our ea well 1+1)-es algorithm actual astronomical observations where twin images were observed over several years optical telescopes
