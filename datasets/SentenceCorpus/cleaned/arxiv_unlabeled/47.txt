 introduction 
time series forecasting problem encountered many fields applications finance returns stock markets hydrology river floods engineering electrical consumption etc
many methods designed time series forecasting perform well depending complexity problem rather short-term horizon but rather poor longer-term one
due fact methods usually designed optimize performance at short term their use at longer term being not optimized
furthermore they generally carry out prediction single value while real problem sometimes requires predicting vector future values one step
example case some priori known periodicity could interesting predict all values period whole
but forecasting vector requires either more complex models potential loss performance some vector components many distinct single value predicting models potential loss correlation information between various values
methods able forecast whole vector same precision each its components thus great interest
while enlarging prediction horizon course primary interest practitioners there course some limit accuracy expected long-term forecast
limitation due availability information itself not possible limitations forecasting methods
indeed there no doubt whatever forecasting method used predicting at long term i e many time steps advance more difficult predicting at short term because missing information unknown future time steps those between last known value one predict
at some term all prediction methods will thus fail
purpose method presented paper not enlarge time horizon accurate predictions could expected but rather enlarge horizon insights about future evolution series
insights mean some information interest practitioner even if does not mean accurate predictions
example there bounds future values
what expect average
confidence intervals future values large narrow
predicting many steps advance could realized straightforward way subsampling known sequence then using any short-term prediction method
however case loss information used forecast obviously even higher due lower resolution known sequence
furthermore solution does not allow general way introduce stochastic aspect method key issue proposed method
indeed get insights about future evolution series through some statistics expected mean variance confidence intervals quartiles etc  several predictions should made order extract statistics
predictions should differ; stochastic prediction method able generate several forecasts repeated monte-carlo runs
method presented paper stochastic character method results use random draws probability law
another attractive aspect method presented paper used predict scalar values vectors same expected precision each component case vector prediction
having at disposal time series values  prediction vector defined follows : } where size vector predicted data generating process number past values influence future values centred noise vector
past values gathered dimensional vector called regressor
knowledge values time series  means relation  known many   time steps past
modeling problem then becomes estimate function models correctly time series whole set past regressors
idea method segment space dimensional regressors
segmentation seen way make possible local modeling each segment
part method achieved using self-organizing map som
prototypes obtained each class model locally regressors corresponding class
furthermore order take into account temporal dependences series deformation regressors built
those vectors constructed differences between two consecutive regressors
set regressor deformations also segmented using som
once those two spaces segmented their dependences characterized simulations performed
using kind monte-carlo procedure repeat simulations then possible estimate distribution simulations forecast global trends time series at long term
though could chosen some other classical vector quantization vq method only clustering property interest here choice som tool perform segmentation two spaces justified fact som efficient fast compared other vq methods limited complexity they provide intuitive helpful graphical representation
following paper first recall some basic concepts about som classification tool
then introduce proposed forecasting method double vector quantization scalar time series then vector ones
next present some experimental results both scalar vector forecastings
proof method stability given appendix
