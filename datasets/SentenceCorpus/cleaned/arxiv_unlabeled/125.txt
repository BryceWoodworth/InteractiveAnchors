 
identify classical perceptron algorithm margin member broader family large margin classifiers collectively call margitron
margitron despite its sharing same update rule perceptron shown incremental setting converge finite number updates solutions possessing any desirable fraction maximum margin
experiments comparing margitron decomposition svms tasks involving linear kernels 2-norm soft margin also reported
 introduction 
widely accepted larger margin solution hyperplane greater generalisation ability learning machine
simplest online learning algorithm binary linear classification perceptron  does not aim at any margin
problem instead finding optimal margin hyperplane lies at core support vector machines svms
their efficient implementation however somewhat hindered fact they require solving quadratic programming problem
complications encountered implementing svms respurred interest alternative large margin classifiers many based perceptron algorithm
oldest algorithm appeared long before advent svms standard perceptron margin  straightforward extension perceptron however incremental setting known able guarantee achieving only up maximum margin dataset possesses
subsequently various algorithms succeeded achieving larger fractions maximum margin employing modified perceptron-like update rules
algorithms include romma  alma  cramma micra
somewhat different approach hard margin one adopted most algorithms above was also developed focuses minimisation 1-norm soft margin loss through stochastic gradient descent
there connection however between algorithms perceptron since their unregularised form constant learning rate identical perceptron margin
notable representatives approach pioneer norma very recent pegasos
question arises naturally attempt answer present work whether possible achieve guaranteed fraction maximum margin larger than while retaining original perceptron update rule
end construct whole new family algorithms at least one member guaranteed convergence finite number steps solution hyperplane possessing any desirable fraction unknown maximum margin
family algorithms classical perceptron margin naturally embedded will termed margitron
hopefully algorithms belonging margitron family virtue being generalisations very successful perceptron will respectable performance various classification tasks
section 2 contains some preliminaries description margitron algorithm
section 3 devoted theoretical analysis
section 4 contains our experimental results while section 5 our conclusions
