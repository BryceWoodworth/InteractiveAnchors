 
remarkable results foster vohra was starting point series papers show any sequence outcomes learned no prior knowledge using some universal randomized forecasting algorithm forecast-dependent checking rules
show class all computationally efficient outcome-forecast-based checking rules property violated
moreover present probabilistic algorithm generating probability close one sequence subsequence simultaneously miscalibrates all partially weakly computable randomized forecasting algorithms
according dawid's prequential framework consider partial recursive randomized algorithms
 introduction 
let binary sequence outcomes observed forecaster whose task give probability future event
evaluation probability forecasts based method called calibration : informally following dawid forecaster said well-calibrated if any event holds moments time he choose see also 
let us give some notations
let set all infinite binary sequences set all finite binary sequences empty sequence
any finite infinite sequence  write put 
also denotes length sequence
if finite sequence finite infinite sequence then denotes concatenation sequences means some
measure-theoretic framework expect forecaster method assigning probabilities future event all possible finite sequences
