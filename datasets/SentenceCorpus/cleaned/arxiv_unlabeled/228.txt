 introduction 
term convergence  reinforcement learning context refers stability learning process underlying model over time
similar single agent reinforcement learning algorithms q-learning  convergence multi-agent reinforcement learning marl algorithm important property received considerable attention
however proving convergence marl algorithm via theoretical analysis significantly more challenging than proving convergence single agent case
presence other agents also learning deem environment non-stationary therefore violating foundational assumption single agent learning
fact proving convergence marl algorithm even 2-player-2-action single-stage games arguably simplest class multi-agent systems domains been challenging
consequence experimental verification usually method choice number agents grows theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex
cooperative agents researchers typically verified stability marl algorithm observing evolution some global performance metric overtime
not surprising since ultimate goal cooperative system optimize some global metric
examples global performance metrics include percentage total number delivered packets routing problems  average turn around time tasks task allocation problems  average reward received agents general
if global metric improves over time eventually appears stabilize usually considered reasonable verification convergence
even if underlying agent policies not stable one could argue at end global performance all matters cooperative system
paper challenges above widely-used practice establishes need better experimental frameworks measures assessing stability large-scale cooperative systems
show experimental case study where stability global performance metric hide underlying instability system
hidden instability later leads significant drop global performance metric itself
propose alternative measure relies agents' local policies: policy entropy
experimentally show proposed metric more effective than traditional global performance metric exposing instability marl algorithms large-scale multi-agent systems
