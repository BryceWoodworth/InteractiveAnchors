 introduction 
learning problem ranking arises many modern applications including design search engines information extraction movie recommendation systems
applications ordering documents movies returned critical aspect system
problem been formulated within two distinct settings
score-based setting  learning algorithm receives labeled sample pairwise preferences returns scoring function induces linear ordering points set
test points simply ranked according values those points
several ranking algorithms including rankboost  svm-type ranking  other algorithms prank  were designed setting
generalization bounds been given setting pairwise misranking error  including margin-based bounds
stability-based generalization bounds also been given setting wide classes ranking algorithms both case bipartite ranking general case
somewhat different two-stage scenario was considered other publications starting cohen schapire singer  later balcan et al  will refer preference-based setting
first stage setting preference function learned where values closer one indicate ranked above values closer zero opposite
typically assumed output classification algorithm trained sample labeled pairs example convex combination simpler preference functions
crucial difference score-based setting general preference function does not induce linear ordering
order induces may non-transitive thus may example three distinct points  
rank test subset  second stage algorithm orders points making use preference function learned first stage
paper deals preference-based ranking setting just described
advantage setting learning algorithm not required return linear ordering all points  impossible achieve faultlessly accordance true pairwise preference labeling non-transitive
more likely achievable exactly better approximation when algorithm requested instead setting supply linear ordering only limited subset
when preference function learned binary classification algorithm preference-based setting viewed reduction ranking problem classification one
second stage specifies how ranking obtained using preference function
cohen schapire singer showed second stage preference-based setting general problem finding linear ordering few pairwise misrankings possible respect preference function np-complete
authors presented greedy algorithm based tournament degree each element defined difference between number elements preferred versus number those preferred
bound proven authors formulated terms pairwise disagreement loss respect preference function  written  where loss achieved permutation returned their algorithm one achieved optimal permutation respect preference function
bound was given general case ranking but particular case bipartite ranking define below random ordering achieve pairwise disagreement loss thus bound not informative
more recently balcan et al studied bipartite ranking problem showed sorting elements according same tournament degree used guarantees pairwise misranking regret at most using binary classifier regret
however due quadratic nature definition tournament degree their algorithm requires calls preference function  where number objects rank
describe efficient algorithm second stage preference-based setting thus reducing learning problem ranking binary classification
improve recent result balcan et al  guaranteeing average pairwise misranking regret at most using binary classifier regret
other words improve their constant
our reduction applies different constants broader class ranking loss functions admits simpler proof expected running time complexity our algorithm terms number calls classifier preference function improved
furthermore when top ranked elements only required   many applications information extraction search engines time complexity our algorithm further reduced
our reduction algorithm thus practical realistic applications where number points rank exceeds several thousands
much our results also extend beyond bipartite case previously studied general case ranking
by-product our proofs also bound pairwise disagreement loss respect preference function will compare result given cohen schapire singer
algorithm used balcan et al produce ranking based preference function known sort-by-degree been recently used context minimizing feedback arcset tournaments
here use different algorithm quicksort also been recently used minimizing feedback arcset tournaments
