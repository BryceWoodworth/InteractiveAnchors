 
paper introduce class stationary prediction strategies construct prediction algorithm asymptotically performs well best continuous stationary strategy
make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about environment
particular no assumption stationarity made about environment stationarity considered strategies only means they do not depend explicitly time; argue natural consider only stationary strategies even highly non-stationary environments
 introduction 
paper belongs area learning theory been variously referred prediction expert advice competitive on-line prediction prediction individual sequences universal on-line learning; see review
there many proof techniques known field; paper based kalnishkan vyugin's weak aggregating algorithm  but possible some numerous other techniques could used instead
section give main definitions state our main results theorems ; their proofs given sections 
section informally discuss notion stationarity section concludes
