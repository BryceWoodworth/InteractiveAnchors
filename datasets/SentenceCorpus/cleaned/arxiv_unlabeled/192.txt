known when gabp converges converges correct map estimate gaussian random vector simple sufficient conditions its convergence been established
paper develop double-loop algorithm forcing convergence gabp
our method computes correct map estimate even cases where standard gabp would not converged
further extend construction compute least-squares solutions over-constrained linear systems
believe our construction numerous applications since gabp algorithm linked solution linear systems equations fundamental problem computer science engineering
case study discuss linear detection problem
show using our new construction able force convergence montanari's linear detection algorithm cases where would originally fail
consequence able increase significantly number users transmit concurrently
