 introduction 
describe \bayesum algorithm performing query-focused summarization common case there many relevant documents given query
given query collection relevant documents our algorithm functions asking itself following question: what about relevant documents differentiates them non relevant documents \bayesum\ seen providing statistical formulation exact question
key requirement \bayesum\ multiple relevant documents known query question
not severe limitation
two well-studied problems de-facto standard
standard multidocument summarization without query access known relevant documents some user need
similarly case web-search application underlying ir engine will retrieve multiple presumably relevant documents given query
both tasks \bayesum\ performs well even when underlying retrieval model noisy
idea leveraging known relevant documents known query expansion information retrieval community where been shown successful ad hoc retrieval tasks
viewed perspective ir our work interpreted two ways
first seen application query expansion summarization task ir terminology passage retrieval); see
second more importantly seen method query expansion non-ad-hoc manner
\bayesum\ statistically justified query expansion method language modeling ir framework
