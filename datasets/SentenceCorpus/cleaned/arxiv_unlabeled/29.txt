 introduction 
there at least two kinds similarity
attributional similarity correspondence between attributes relational similarity correspondence between relations
when two words high degree attributional similarity call them synonyms
when two word pairs high degree relational similarity say they analogous
verbal analogies often written form a:b::c:d\/  meaning b c d ; example traffic:street::water:riverbed
traffic flows over street; water flows over riverbed
street carries traffic; riverbed carries water
there high degree relational similarity between word pair traffic:street word pair water:riverbed
fact analogy basis several mathematical theories traffic flow
section look more closely at connections between attributional relational similarity
analogies mason:stone::carpenter:wood seems relational similarity reduced attributional similarity since mason carpenter attributionally similar stone wood
general reduction fails
consider analogy traffic:street::water:riverbed
traffic water not attributionally similar
street riverbed only moderately attributionally similar
many algorithms been proposed measuring attributional similarity between two words
measures attributional similarity been studied extensively due their applications problems recognizing synonyms  information retrieval  determining semantic orientation  grading student essays  measuring textual cohesion  word sense disambiguation
other hand since measures relational similarity not well developed measures attributional similarity potential applications relational similarity not well known
many problems involve semantic relations would benefit algorithm measuring relational similarity
discuss related problems natural language processing information retrieval information extraction more detail section
paper builds vector space model vsm information retrieval
given query search engine produces ranked list documents
documents ranked order decreasing attributional similarity between query each document
almost all modern search engines measure attributional similarity using vsm \namecite{turneylittman05} adapt vsm approach measuring relational similarity
they used vector frequencies patterns corpus represent relation between pair words
section presents vsm approach measuring similarity
section present algorithm measuring relational similarity call latent relational analysis lra
algorithm learns large corpus unlabeled unstructured text without supervision
lra extends vsm approach \namecite{turneylittman05} three ways: 1 connecting patterns derived automatically corpus instead using fixed set patterns 2 singular value decomposition svd used smooth frequency data 3 given word pair traffic:street lra considers transformations word pair generated replacing one words synonyms traffic:road traffic:highway
section presents our experimental evaluation lra collection 374 multiple-choice word analogy questions sat college entrance exam
example typical sat question appears table
educational testing literature first pair mason:stone called stem analogy
correct choice called solution incorrect choices distractors
evaluate lra testing its ability select solution avoid distractors
average performance college-bound senior high school students verbal sat questions corresponds accuracy about 57\%
lra achieves accuracy about 56\%
same questions vsm attained 47\% } one application relational similarity classifying semantic relations noun-modifier pairs
section evaluate performance lra set 600 noun-modifier pairs \namecite{nastase03}
problem classify noun-modifier pair ``laser printer'' according semantic relation between head noun printer modifier laser
600 pairs been manually labeled 30 classes semantic relations
example ``laser printer'' classified instrument ; printer uses laser instrument printing
approach task classifying semantic relations noun-modifier pairs supervised learning problem
600 pairs divided into training testing sets testing pair classified according label its single nearest neighbour training set
lra used measure distance i e  similarity nearness
lra achieves accuracy 39 8\% 30-class problem 58 0\% 5-class problem
same 600 noun-modifier pairs vsm had accuracies 27 8\% 30-class 45 7\% 5-class
discuss experimental results limitations lra future work section conclude section
