well-known construct good ensemble base learners should accurate well
diverse
paper unlabeled data exploited facilitate ensemble learning
helping augment diversity among base learners
specifically semi-supervised ensemble
method named {\udeed} proposed
unlike existing semi-supervised ensemble methods where
error-prone pseudo-labels estimated unlabeled data enlarge labeled data
improve accuracy {\udeed} works maximizing accuracies base learners labeled data while
maximizing diversity among them unlabeled data
experiments show {\udeed} effectively
utilize unlabeled data ensemble learning highly competitive well-established
semi-supervised ensemble methods
 introduction 
ensemble learning  number base learners trained then
combined prediction achieve strong generalization ability
numerous effective ensemble
methods been proposed \textsc{boosting}  \textsc{bagging} 
\textsc{stacking}  etc  most methods work under supervised setting
where labels training examples known
many real-world tasks however unlabeled
training examples readily available while obtaining their labels would fairly expensive
semi-supervised learning major paradigm exploit unlabeled data together
labeled training data improve learning performance automatically without human
intervention
paper deals semi-supervised ensembles ensemble learning labeled
unlabeled data
contrast huge volume literatures ensemble learning
semi-supervised learning only few work been devoted study semi-supervised
ensembles
indicated zhou  was caused different philosophies
ensemble learning community semi-supervised learning community
ensemble learning
community believes able boost performance weak learners strong learners
using multiple learners so there no need use unlabeled data; while semi-supervised
learning community believes able boost performance weak learners strong
learners exploiting unlabeled data so there no need use multiple learners
however
zhou indicated  there several important reasons why ensemble learning
semi-supervised learning actually mutually beneficial among important one
considering unlabeled data possible help augment diversity among base
learners explained following paragraph
well-known generalization error ensemble related average
generalization error base learners diversity among base learners
generally
lower average generalization error higher average accuracy base learners
higher diversity among base learners better ensemble
previous
ensemble methods work under supervised setting trying achieve high average accuracy
high diversity using labeled training set
noteworthy however pursuing high
accuracy high diversity may suffer dilemma
example two classifiers
perfect performance labeled training set they would not diversity since there
no difference between their predictions training examples
thus increase diversity
needs sacrifice accuracy one classifier
however when unlabeled data might
find two classifiers actually make different predictions unlabeled data
would
important ensemble design
example given two pairs classifiers  if know all them 100 accuracy labeled training data then there
will no difference taking either ensemble consisting ensemble consisting
; however if find make same predictions unlabeled data
while make different predictions some unlabeled data then will know
ensemble consisting should better
so contrast previous ensemble methods
focus achieving both high accuracy high diversity using only labeled data use
unlabeled data would open promising direction designing new ensemble methods
paper propose {\udeed}  unlabeled data enhance ensemble diversity 
approach
experiments show using unlabeled data diversity augmentation {\udeed}
achieves much better performance than its counterpart does not consider usefulness
unlabeled data
moreover {\udeed} also achieves highly comparable performance other
state-of-the-art semi-supervised ensemble methods
