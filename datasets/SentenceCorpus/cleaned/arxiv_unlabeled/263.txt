 introduction 
consider scenario where agents learn their experiments small adjustments
might example about choosing their telephone companies about their portfolio investments
% will assume rational
% assume agents rational
interested understanding when whole market converge towards rational situations i e nash equilibria sense game theory
natural expect dynamics adjustments stochastic fully distributed since expect agents adapt their strategies based their local knowledge market since agents often involved games where global hence local deterministic description whole global market not possible
% also want avoid dynamics would suppose global knowledge market say several dynamics adjustments been considered recently algorithmic game theory literature
up our knowledge been done mainly deterministic dynamics best-response based dynamics: computing best response requires global description market
stochastic variations avoiding global description been considered
however considered dynamics somehow rather ad-hoc order get efficient convergence time bounds still mainly best-response based
want consider here more general dynamics discuss when one may expect convergence
could lead consider any dynamics monotone respect utility players relation evolutionary game theory literature
propose restrict here dynamics lead dynamics related possibly perturbed replicator dynamics
somehow algorithmic game theory seen algorithmic version classical game theory our long term aim better understand algorithmic evolutionary game theory
somehow could also say best-response dynamics seen strategies visit corners simplex mixed strategies interested long term objective learning methods could seen interior point methods find equilibria
basic game theory framework
let set players
every player set pure strategies
let cardinal
mixed strategy corresponds probability distribution over pure strategies: pure strategy chosen probability 
let simplex mixed strategies player
any pure strategy considered mixed strategy  where vector denotes unit probability vector component unity hence corner
let space all mixed strategies
strategy profile specifies mixed pure strategies all players: corresponds mixed strategy played player
following classical convention write often write abusively  where denotes vector strategies played all other players
allow games whose payoffs may random: only assume whenever strategy profile known each player gets random cost expected value
particular expected cost player playing pure strategy denoted
some classes games
several classes % deterministic games where players' costs based shared usage common set resources where each resource associated nondecreasing cost function denoted  been considered algorithmic game theory literature
load balancing games  resources called machines players compete elements i e singleton subsets
hence pure strategy space player having weight corresponds subset  pure strategy player some element
cost player task under profile pure strategies assignment corresponds  where load machine :  say % defined sum weights tasks running
congestion games  resources called edges players compete subsets
hence pure strategy space player subset pure strategy player subset
cost player under profile pure strategies corresponds where number % players use resource  say number
weighted congestion games  weights associated players one takes instead
task allocation games  load balancing games resources called machines players compete elements i e singleton subsets
each resource machine assumed function takes input set tasks assigned outputs cost each participating player
cost player under profile pure strategies then given
functions considered speed scheduling policies associated costs corresponding completion time player task
example spt lpt policies schedule jobs without preemption respectively order increasing decreasing weights processing times
clearly load balancing games particular task allocation games load balancing games particular weighted congestion games
load balancing game whose weights unitary particular congestion game
ordinal potential games
all classes games related ordinal potential games introduced : game ordinal potential game if there exists some function pure strategies all pure strategies    one
