 introduction 
recent years opportunistic spectrum access cognitive radio been focus significant research efforts
works propose improve spectral efficiency making smarter use large portion frequency bands remains unused
licensed band cognitive radio goal share bands licensed primary users non primary users called secondary users cognitive users
secondary users must carefully %sense primary users's presence adapt their own transmission identify available spectrum resources communicate avoiding disturb primary network
opportunistic spectrum access thus potential significantly increasing spectral efficiency wireless networks
paper focus opportunistic communication model previously considered  consists channels single secondary user searches idle channels temporarily unused primary users
channels modeled gilbert-elliot channels: at each time slot channel either idle occupied availability channel evolves markovian way
assuming secondary user only sense channels simultaneously  his main task choose channel sense at each time aiming maximise its expected long-term transmission efficiency
under model channel allocation may interpreted planning task particular class partially observed markov decision process pomdp also called restless bandits
works  assumed statistical information about primary users' traffic fully available secondary user
practice however statistical characteristics traffic %(i e transition probabilities availabilty each channel not fixed priori must somehow estimated secondary user
secondary user selects channels sense not faced simple parameter estimation problem but task closer reinforcement learning
consider scenarios secondary user first carries out exploration phase statistical information regarding model gathered then follows exploitation phase  where optimal sensing policy based estimated parameters applied
key issue reach proper balance between exploration exploitation
issue been considered before who proposed asymptotic rule set length exploration phase but without precise evaluation performance approach
lai et al also considered problem multiple secondary users case but simpler model where each channel modeled independent identically distributed source
field reinforcement learning class problems known model-based reinforcement learning several approaches been proposed recently
however none directly applies channel allocation model state channels only partially observed
our contribution consists proposing strategy termed tiling algorithm  adaptively setting length exploration phase
under strategy length exploration phase not fixed beforehand exploration phase terminated soon accumulated enough statistical evidence determine optimal sensing policy
distinctive feature approach comes strong performance guarantees form finite-horizon regret bounds
sake clarity strategy described general framework parametric pomdps
remark channel access model corresponds specific example pomdp parameterized transition probabilities availability each channel
approach relies restrictive assumption each possible parameter value solution planning problem fully known not applicable pomdps at large but well suited case channel allocation model
provide detailed account use approach two simple instances opportunistic channel access model including case stochastically identical channels considered
article organized follows
