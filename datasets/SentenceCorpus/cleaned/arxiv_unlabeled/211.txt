 
many reinforcement learning exploration techniques overly optimistic try explore every state
exploration impossible environments unlimited number states
i propose use simulated exploration optimistic model discover promising paths real exploration
reduces needs real exploration
 introduction 
reinforcement learning agent collects rewards environment
environment not known advance
agent explore learn where go
reward could received when taking action state
agent aims maximize her long-term reward environment
she should not miss any state important reward shorter path
there many existing exploration techniques optimistic face uncertainty
their optimism assumes greater reward will obtained when taking unknown action
problem how do exploration environments unlimited number states
environments not possible try every action every possible state
i study new way do exploration environments unlimited number states
i use simulated exploration incentive real exploration
simulated exploration proposes promising paths explore
i describe how use kind exploration section
my experiments section demonstrate how simulated exploration reduced needed amount real exploration
i also discuss when possible
many works touched related problems
they inspired me i discuss them section
