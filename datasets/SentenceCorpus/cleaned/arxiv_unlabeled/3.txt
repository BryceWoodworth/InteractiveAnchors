 introduction 
paper address problem distributed learning under communication constraints  motivated primarily distributed signal processing wireless sensor networks wsns data mining distributed databases
wsns fortiori designed make inferences environments they sensing; however they typically characterized constraints energy bandwidth limit sensors' ability share data each other centralized fusion center
data mining distributed databases multiple agents e g  corporations access possibly overlapping databases wish collaborate make optimal inferences; privacy security concerns however may preclude them fully sharing information
nonparametric methods studied within machine learning demonstrated widespread empirical success many centralized i e  communication unconstrained  signal processing applications
thus both aforementioned applications natural question arises: power machine learning methods tapped nonparametric inference distributed learning under communication constraints
paper address question formalizing general model distributed learning then deriving distributed algorithm collaborative training regularized kernel least-squares regression
algorithm viewed instantiation successive orthogonal projection algorithms thus insight into statistical behavior algorithms gleaned standard analyses mathematical programming
