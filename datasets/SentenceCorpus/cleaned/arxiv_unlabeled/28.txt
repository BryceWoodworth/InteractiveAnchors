allowing randomization remove requirement convexity
 introduction 
paper belongs area research known universal prediction individual sequences see review): predictor's goal compete wide benchmark class prediction strategies
previous papers constructed prediction strategies competitive important classes markov stationary respectively continuous prediction strategies
paper consider competing against possibly discontinuous strategies
our main results assert existence prediction strategies competitive markov strategies
paper's idea transition continuous general benchmark classes was motivated skorokhod's topology space ``c\`adl\`ag'' functions most discontinuous
skorokhod's idea was allow small deformations not only along vertical axis but also along horizontal axis when defining neighborhoods
skorokhod's topology was metrized kolmogorov so became separable space   appendix iii;  p 913 allows us apply one numerous algorithms prediction expert advice kalnishkan vyugin's weak aggregating algorithm paper construct universal algorithm
section give main definitions state our main results theorems ; their proofs given sections  respectively
