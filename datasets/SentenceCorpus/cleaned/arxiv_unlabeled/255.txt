 
learn multiple hypotheses related tasks under latent hierarchical relationship between tasks
exploit intuition domain adaptation  wish share classifier structure but multitask learning  wish share covariance structure
our hierarchical model seen subsume several previously proposed multitask learning models performs well three distinct real-world data sets
 introduction 
consider two related but distinct tasks: domain adaptation da multitask learning mtl
both involve learning related hypotheses multiple data sets
da learn multiple classifiers solving same problem over data different distributions
mtl learn multiple classifiers solving different problems over data same distribution
seen bayesian perspective natural solution hierarchical model hypotheses leaves
however when there more than two hypotheses learned i e  more than two domains more than two tasks immediate question is: all hypotheses equally related
if not what their relationship
address issues proposing two hierarchical models latent hierarchies one da one mtl models nearly identical
treat hierarchy nonparametrically employing kingman's coalescent
derive em algorithm makes use recently developed efficient inference algorithms coalescent
several da mtl problems show efficacy our model
our models da mtl share common structure based unknown hierarchy
key difference between da model mtl model what information shared across hierarchy
simplicity consider case linear classifiers logistic regression linear regression
extended non-linear classifiers moving gaussian processes
domain adaption useful model assume there single classifier ``does well'' all domains
context hierarchical bayesian modeling interpret saying weight vector associated linear classifier generated according hierarchical structure
other hand mtl one does not expect same weight vector do well all problems
instead common assumption features co-vary similar ways between tasks
hierarchical bayesian model interpret saying covariance structure associated linear classifiers generated according hierarchical structure
brief: da share weights; mtl share covariance
