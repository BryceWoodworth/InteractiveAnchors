 introduction 
\parstart{l}{earning} methods generally classified into supervised unsupervised reinforcement learning rl
supervised learning requires explicit feedback provided input-output pairs gives map inputs outputs
unsupervised learning only processes input data
contrast rl uses scalar value named reward evaluate input-output pairs learns mapping states actions interaction environment through trial-and-error
since 1980s rl become important approach machine learning   widely used artificial intelligence especially robotics    due its good performance on-line adaptation powerful learning ability complex nonlinear systems
however there still some difficult problems practical applications
one problem exploration strategy contributes lot better balancing exploration trying previously unexplored strategies find better policy exploitation taking most advantage experienced knowledge
other its slow learning speed especially complex problems sometimes known ``the curse dimensionality" when state-action space becomes huge number parameters learned grows exponentially its dimension
combat those problems many methods been proposed recent years
temporal abstraction decomposition methods been explored solve problems rl dynamic programming dp speed up learning 
different kinds learning paradigms combined optimize rl
