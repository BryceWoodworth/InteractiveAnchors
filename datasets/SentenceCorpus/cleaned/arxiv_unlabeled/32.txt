 introduction 
extraction structural information raw data problem great interest both fundamental applied studies
paper will focus one specific example problem  classification
goal predict class particular event
problem was approached number different disciplines including statistical data analysis  machine learning  fuzzy logic  operations research data mining
result variety learning techniques was developed
result learning represented number different forms
form interested working set rules
should stressed some other forms decision trees fuzzy models many others equivalent set rules
set rules any other form equivalent often preferred form knowledge representation because allows simple answer question ``what was learned
'' specific set rules was learned data
algorithm produces only answer often impossible understand what was really learned why specific answer was produced two mentioned knowledge representations differ follows: case result rule learned knowledge represented language richer than one used describe dataset; case result value learned knowledge represented same language one used describe dataset  model--based techniques developed  take training data input produce set rules statements equivalent rules classify any event
lazy instance--based techniques developed  return result tailored specific event want classify
techniques events similar given one usually found first then prediction based found instances made
interesting attempt combine model based lazy instance based learning was presented
greedy lazy model--based approach classification was developed result was rule tailored specific observation
while approach gives simple rule answer often much easier understand than complex rules set often works faster classification single event it--as every greedy algorithm--is not guaranteed find best rule because algorithm may not reach global maximum quality criterion sub--optimal rule may returned
work approach based brute force rule--space scanning was developed
was used finding ``nuggets'' knowledge data each nugget rule high degree correctness
contrast greedy type algorithms massive search algorithms guaranteed find best rule(s
our early work presented approach combined massive model--based rule search approach lazy instance--based learning
work were also interested ``nuggets'' knowledge but only those were applicable instance wanted classify
result was set rules were applicable classification given event
one may think about rules projection global classification rules set given instance event
current paper approach taken next level practical algorithm applicable variety problems presented
number significant improvements been made since early version
current algorithm includes following new features: 1
highly optimized rule--space scanning allows problems significant number attributes solved; 2
integration levels selection procedure ordered continuous literal attributes rule search algorithm; 3
information about dependent attributes directly included into tree search algorithm thus significantly reducing computational complexity; 4
original conflicting rules resolution strategy was especially built work automatically generated rules
create practical algorithm three aspects  logical statistical computational complexity need addressed
section formulate problem discuss logical formulas represent rules interested finding
section discuss statistical quality criterion used evaluation rule quality specify criteria use work
also present conflicting rules resolution strategy automatically generated rules
at end section sketch algorithm presented
section discuss selection attributes analysis; should stressed some attributes they built section not independent fact known advance
section discuss computational complexity issues; approach includes information about dependence attributes into algorithm proposed
section discuss error estimation
section present data analysis results compare our results results c4 5r8
