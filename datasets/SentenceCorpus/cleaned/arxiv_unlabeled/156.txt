however real shapes image datasets even when expected related ``almost isometric'' transformations actually subject not only noise but also some limited degree variations appearance scale
paper introduce graphical model parameterises appearance distance angle features learn all involved parameters via structured prediction
outcome model near-rigid shape matching robust sense able capture possibly limited but still important scale appearance variations
our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models while maintaining similar running times
 introduction 
matching shapes images many applications including image retrieval alignment registration
typically matching approached selecting features set landmark points both images; correspondence between two then chosen some distance measure between features minimised
great deal attention been devoted defining complex features robust changes rotation scale etc

important class matching problems near-isometric shape matching
setting assumed shapes defined up isometric transformation allowing some noise therefore distance features typically used encode shape
some traditional methods related settings focus optimisation over space rigid transformations so minimise least-squares criteria
recently class problems been approached different perspective direct optimisation over space correspondences
although apparently more expensive there shown rigidity assumption imposes convenient algebraic structure correspondence space so allow efficient algorithms exact inference chordal graphical models small clique size
more recently methods been made substantially faster
key idea methods explicitly encode rigidity constraints into tractable graphical model whose map solution corresponds best match
however main advantages correspondence-based optimisation over transformation-based optimisation namely flexibility encoding powerful local features not been further explored framework
other lines work optimise directly over correspondence space those based graph matching explicitly model all pairwise compatibilities solve best match some relaxation since graph matching problem np-hard general pairwise compatibilities
recently was shown both if some form structured optimisation used optimise graph matching scores relaxed quadratic assignment predictors improve power pairwise features
key idea methods learn compatibility scores graph matching objective function therefore enriching representability features
downside graph matching methods however they do not typically make explicit use geometry scene order improve computational efficiency and/or accuracy
paper combine two lines work into single framework
produce exact efficient model solve near-isometric shape matching problems using not only isometry-invariant features but also appearance scale-invariant features all encoded tractable graphical model
doing so learn via large-margin structured prediction relative importances variations appearance scale regard variations shape per se
therefore even knowing near-isometric setting will still capture eventual variations appearance scale into our matching criterion order produce robust near-isometric matcher
