 introduction 
requirements classifying rule supervised learning problems consist two parts
first part induced set precedents called training set
each element training set pair "object--reply" type
classifying rule mapping objects set replies set should map objects training set pairs consistent replies
second part requirements express our common knowledge classifying rule
one popular types requirements monotonicity considered paper
some cases two parts requirements not satisfied both then problem minimal correction training set
let us see what problem
suppose sets given sets partial orders consistently
assume more partial order lattice
any given mapping where pose problem finding function monotone due partial orders minimizes following functional:
let us denote set monotonic functions
then given mapping our task following: every mapping monotone subset extended mapping monotone whole set because lattice
actually every finite subset lattice operation defined function both monotone satisfies
see posed problem imply
above said conclude more problem equivalent finding maximal subset function restricted subset monotone
so let us consider following generalization our problem will call maxcms(maximal consistent monotonicity set {maxcms } finite sets where given; each them partial orders defined consistently function given
then every element assigned positive integer weight
our task find maximal weight subset function restricted monotone i e {definition 1 } set called acceptable iff function restricted monotone {definition 2 } set acceptable maximal weight denoted some cases use notation mean weight set
remainder paper will consider problem
