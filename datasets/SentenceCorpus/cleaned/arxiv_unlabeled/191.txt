 introduction 
work derives interval estimates under imprecise dirichlet model idm large class statistical estimators
idm one considers iid \ process unknown chances outcome
prior uncertainty about modeled set dirichlet priors  where% %  hyper-parameter typically chosen between 1 2
sets probability distributions often called imprecise probabilities hence name idm model
avoid term imprecise use robust instead capitalize imprecise
idm overcomes several fundamental problems other approaches uncertainty suffer
instance idm satisfies representation invariance principle symmetry principle mutually exclusive pure bayesian treatment proper prior
counts form minimal sufficient statistic data size
statistical estimators usually also depend chosen prior: so set priors leads set estimators
instance expected chances lead robust interval estimate
robust intervals variance mean variance linear-combinations also been derived
bayesian estimators like expectations depend only through suppress i e \
main objective work derive approximate conservative exact intervals general  expected also called predictive entropy expected mutual information particular
results key building blocks applying idm
walley suggests instance use inference problems decision problems  where some function
one application inference robust tree-dependency structures  edges partially ordered based imprecise mutual information
