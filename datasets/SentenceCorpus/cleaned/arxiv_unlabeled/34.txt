complex situations however does not extract useful features because its linearity
other hand kernel method used support vector machine efficient approach improve linear method
paper investigate effectiveness applying kernel method canonical correlation analysis \\ {keyword:} multivariate analysis multimodal data kernel method regularization
 introduction 
paper deals method extract common features multiple information sources
instance let us consider task learning pattern recognition object given using image its name given speech
newly given image system required answer its name speech newly given speech system answer corresponding image
task considered regression problem image speech vice versa
however since dimensionalities images speeches generally very large regression analysis many not work effectively
order solve problem useful map inputs into low dimensional feature space then solve regression problem
canonical correlation analysis cca been used purpose
cca finds linear transformation pair multi-variates correlation coefficient maximized
information theoretical point view transformation maximizes mutual information between extracted features
however if there nonlinear relation between variates cca does not always extract useful features
other hand support vector machines svm attracted lot attention its state-of-art performance pattern recognition kernel trick used svm applicable not only classification but also other linear techniques example kernel regression kernel pca paper apply kernel method cca
since kernel method likely overfit data incorporate some regularization technique avoid overfitting
