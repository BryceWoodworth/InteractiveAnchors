 introduction 
past few years there been huge interest support vector machines~(svms because they excellent generalization performance wide range problems
key work training svms solve follow quadratic optimization problem
where vector all ones upper bound all variables  kernel function
notable effects been taken into training svms
unlike most optimization methods update whole vector each iteration decomposition method modifies only subset per iteration
each iteration variable indices split into "working set": its complement
then sub-problem variables  solved thereby leaving values remaining variables unchanged
method leads small sub-problem minimized each iteration
extreme case sequential minimal optimization~(smo  restricts working set only two elements
comparative tests against other algorithms done platt  indicates smo often much faster better scaling properties
since only few components updated per iteration difficult problems decomposition method suffers slow convergence
better method working set selection reduce number iterations hence important research issue
some methods were proposed solve problem reduce time training svms
paper %we proposed propose new model select working set
model specially selects without reselection
another word once selected they will not tested selected during following working set selection
experiments demonstrate new model general faster than existing methods
paper organized following
section ii give literature review smo decomposition method existing working set selection both discussed
new method working set selection then presented section iii
section iv experiments corresponding analysis given
finally section v concludes paper
