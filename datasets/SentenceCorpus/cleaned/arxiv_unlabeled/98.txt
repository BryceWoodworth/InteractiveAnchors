much recent interest been devoted reconstruction dependency structure independent samples markov random fields
analyze simple algorithm reconstructing underlying graph defining markov random field nodes maximum degree given observations
show under mild non-degeneracy conditions reconstructs generating graph high probability using samples where depend local interactions
most local interaction order
our results optimal function up multiplicative constant depending strength local interactions
our results seem first results general models guarantee generating model reconstructed
furthermore provide explicit running time bound
cases where measure graph correlation decay running time all fixed
also discuss effect observing noisy samples show long noise level low our algorithm effective
other hand construct example where large noise implies non-identifiability even generic noise interactions
finally briefly show some simple cases models hidden nodes also recovered
 introduction 
paper consider problem reconstructing graph structure markov random field independent identically distributed samples
markov random fields mrf provide very general framework defining high dimensional distributions reconstruction mrf observations attracted much recent interest particular biology see eg  list related references
