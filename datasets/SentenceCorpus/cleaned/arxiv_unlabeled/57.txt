topology design sensor networks not received much attention literature
references consider restrict classes random graphs particular small-world topologies
more general question designing topology maximizes convergence rate under constraint number network links was considered our previous work  where reduced average consensus problem distributed inference sensor networks; see also
realistic networks operate under stress: model non-deterministic network topology random field
specifically assume following: designing network topology corresponds then paper extends our preliminary convergence results  networks random links
recent paper adopts similar model analyzes convergence properties using ergodicity stochastic matrices
consensus randomized network also relates gossip algorithms  where only single pair randomly selected sensors allowed communicate at each iteration communication exchanged nodes averaged
our randomized consensus use multiple randomly selected links at each iteration contradistinction  design optimal topology i e  optimal weight not simple average optimal probabilities edge utilization recognizing communication entails costs there communication cost constraint
other recent work evolving topologies includes considers continuous time consensus networks switching topologies communication delays studies distributed consensus when network complete graph identical link failure probabilities all links
