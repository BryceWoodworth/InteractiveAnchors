group cognitive users cooperatively tries exploit vacancies primary licensed channels whose occupancies follow markovian evolution

then consider more practical scenario where exact distribution signal primary unknown
assume parametric model distribution develop algorithm learn true distribution still guaranteeing constraint interference probability

 introduction 
cognitive radios exploit vacancies licensed spectrum been proposed solution ever-increasing demand radio spectrum
idea sense times when specific licensed band not used at particular place use band unlicensed transmissions without causing interference licensed user referred `primary'
important part designing systems develop efficient channel selection policy
cognitive radio also called `secondary user' needs adopt best strategy selecting channels sensing access
sensing access policies should jointly ensure probability interfering primary's transmission meets given constraint
first part paper consider design joint sensing access policy assuming markovian model primary spectrum usage channels being monitored
secondary users use observations made each slot track probability occupancy different channels
obtain suboptimal solution resultant pomdp problem
second part paper propose study more practical problem arises when secondary users not aware exact distribution signals they receive primary transmitters
develop algorithm learns unknown statistics show scheme gives improved performance over naive scheme assumes worst-case value unknown distribution
