 
one most utilized data mining tasks search association rules
association rules represent %probabilistically significant relationships between items transactions
extend concept association rule represent much broader class associations refer entity-relationship rules
semantically entity-relationship rules express associations between properties related objects
syntactically rules based broad subclass safe domain relational calculus queries
propose new definition support confidence entity-relationship rules frequency entity-relationship queries
prove definition frequency satisfies standard probability axioms apriori property
 introduction 
one goals data mining discover interesting relationships data
association rules express relationships hold sufficient frequency but not always
example may case not all managers earn over \ pq p q q p p q p q pq p q fr(pq)$
our definition frequency er queries generalizes previous work defining association rules multi-relational setting
discusses extending itemset rules negations motivates usefulness extension
query extension approach system presents special class entity-relationship rules allows conjunctions nonnegated statements existential quantification
our concept er rules %allows features addition negations universal quantification nested quantifiers nested boolean combinations
thus one contribution paper extended rule format
characteristic distinguishes our approach previous work previous approaches assume given target table defines base set tuples evaluating support query
contrast start query define natural base set tuples evaluating support query
think approach dynamically generating entity sets given query rather than evaluating queries respect fixed entity set
thus second main contribution paper new definition support rules our extended format
paper organized follows
first review basic relational database concepts relational schema domain relational calculus
then introduce concept entity query define frequency query class queries
definition provides basis notion entity-relationship rule defining support entity-relationship rule
compare entity-relationship queries frequent itemsets rule language system
final section establishes sevveral important formal properties query frequencies define them shows they satisfy apriori property frequency conjunction no greater than frequency its conjuncts
