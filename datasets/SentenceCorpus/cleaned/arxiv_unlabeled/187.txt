 
let matrix rank  assume uniformly random subset its entries observed
describe efficient algorithm reconstructs observed entries relative root mean square error *} further if sufficiently unstructured then reconstructed exactly entries
settles case bounded rank question left open cand{\`e}s recht improves over guarantees their reconstruction algorithm
complexity our algorithm  opens way its use massive data sets

 introduction 
imagine each customers watches rates subset movies available through movie rental service
yields dataset customer-movie pairs each pair rating
objective collaborative filtering predict rating missing pairs way provide targeted suggestions
made public dataset  challenged research community predict missing ratings root mean square error below } general question address here is: under conditions do known ratings provide sufficient information infer unknown ones
inference problem solved efficiently
second question particularly important view massive size actual data sets
