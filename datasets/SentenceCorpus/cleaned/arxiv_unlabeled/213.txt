 introduction 
all data mining techniques vogue outlier detection comes closest metaphor mining nuggets information real-world data
concerned discovering exceptional behavior certain objects
outlier detection techniques widely been applied medicine e g adverse reactions analysis finance e g financial fraud detection security e g counter-terrorism information security e g intrusions detection so
recent decades many outlier detection approaches been proposed broadly classified into several categories: distribution-based  depth-based  distance-based e g knn  cluster-based e g dbscan density-based e g lof methods
however methods often unsuitable real-world applications due number reasons
firstly real-world data usually scattered distribution where objects loosely distributed domain feature space
`local' point view objects cannot represent explicit patterns e g clusters indicate normal data `behavior'
however `global' point view scattered objects constitute several {mini-clusters} represent pattern subset objects
only objects do not belong any other object groups genuine outliers
unfortunately existing outlier definitions depend assumption most objects crowded few main clusters
they incapable dealing scattered datasets because {mini-clusters} dataset evoke high false-detection rate low precision
secondly difficult current outlier detection approaches set accurate parameters real-world datasets
most outlier algorithms must tuned through {trial-and-error}
impractical because real-world data usually do not contain labels anomalous objects
addition hard evaluate detection performance without confirmation domain experts
therefore detection result will uncontrollable if parameters not properly chosen
alleviate parameter setting problem researchers proposed top style outlier detection methods
instead binary outlier indicator top outlier methods provide ranked list objects represent degree {`outlier-ness'} each object
users domain experts {re-examine} selected top where typically far smaller than cardinality dataset anomalous objects locate real outliers
since detection procedure provide good interaction between data mining experts users top outlier detection methods become popular real-world applications
distance-based top { nearest} neighbour distance typical top style outlier detection approach
order distinguish original {distance-based} outlier detection method  denote { nearest} neighbour distance outlier {top knn} paper
{top knn} outlier distance object its nearest neighbour denoted { distance} short indicates {outlier-ness} object
intuitively larger { distance} higher {outlier-ness} object {top knn} outlier regards objects highest values { distance} outliers
{density-based} outlier local outlier factor lof  was proposed same year top knn
lof outlier factor assigned each object w r t its surrounding neighbourhood
outlier factor depends how data object closely packed its locally reachable neighbourhood
since lof uses threshold differentiate outliers normal objects  same problem parameter setting arises
lower {outlier-ness} threshold will produce high false-detection rate while high threshold value will result missing genuine outliers
recent real-world applications researchers found more reliable use lof top manner  i e \ only objects highest lof values will considered outliers
hereafter call top lof
besides top knn top lof researchers proposed other methods deal real-world data {connectivity-based} cof  resolution {cluster-based} {rb-outlier}
although existing top style outlier detection techniques alleviate difficulty parameter setting detection precision methods paper take {top knn} top lof typical examples low scattered data
section will discuss further problems top knn top lof
paper propose new outlier detection definition named local distance-based outlier factor ldof sensitive outliers scattered datasets
ldof uses relative distance object its neighbours measure how much objects deviate their scattered neighbourhood
higher violation degree object more likely object outlier
addition theoretically analyse properties ldof including its lower bound false-detection probability provide guidelines choosing suitable neighbourhood size
order simplify parameter setting real-world applications top technique employed our approach
validate ldof perform various experiments both synthetic real-world datasets compare our outlier detection performance top knn top lof
experimental results illustrate our proposed top ldof represents significant improvement outlier detection capability scattered datasets

section formally introduce outlier definition our approach mathematically analyse properties our {outlier-ness} factor section
section top ldof outlier detection algorithm described together analysis its complexity
experiments reported section show superiority our method previous approaches at least considered datasets
finally conclusions presented section
