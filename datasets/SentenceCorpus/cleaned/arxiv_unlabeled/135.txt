 introduction 
use algorithmic randomness theory analyze ``the size'' sets infinite sequences random respect parametric families probability distributions
let parametric family probability distributions  where real number given effectively strictly consistent estimator exists family
bernoulli family real parameter example family
theorem shows levin's priory semimeasure set all random sequences positive if only if parameter value computable real number
say property infinite sequences no ``empirical meaning'' if levin's priory semimeasure set all sequences possessing property
respect model biased coin ``a prespecified'' probability head meaningless when noncomputable real number; noncomputable parameters empirical meaning only their totality i e  elements some uncountable sets
example random sequences noncomputable generated bayesian mixture using computable prior
case evidently semicomputable semimeasure set all sequences random respect mixture positive
give appendix simple proof our previous result formulated theorem says levin's priory semimeasure set all infinite binary sequences non-equivalent turing martin-l\"of random sequences positive
particular sequences non-random respect each computable probability distribution
use result prove theorem
theorem shows probabilistic machine constructed probability close outputs random bernoulli sequence parameter not random respect each computable probability distribution
result interpreted bayesian statistical approach insufficient cover all possible ``meaningful'' cases random sequences
