 introduction 
study following density estimation problem considered
there unknown distribution given not necessarily independent samples define empirical distribution
given finite class distributions our objective output error minimized
use norm well justified many useful properties example scale invariance fact approximate identification distribution norm gives estimate probability every event
following two parameters influence error possible estimate: distance empirical error
first parameter required since no control over  hence cannot select distribution better than ``optimal'' distribution  one closest norm
not obvious how define second parameter---the error respect
follow definition  inspired see section precise definition
devroye lugosi analyze two algorithms setting: scheff\'e tournament winner minimum distance estimate
minimum distance estimate defined yatracos  special case minimum distance principle formalized wolfowitz
minimum distance estimate helpful tool example was used obtain estimates smoothing factor kernel density estimates also hypothesis testing
scheff\'e tournament winner algorithm requires fewer computations than minimum distance estimate but strictly weaker guarantees terms two parameters mentioned above than latter
our main contribution two procedures selecting estimate  both same guarantees minimum distance estimate but computationally more efficient
first quadratic  cost matching cost scheff\'e tournament winner algorithm
second one even faster using linearly many  computations after preprocessing 
now outline rest paper
section give required definitions introduce notion test-function variant scheff\'e set
then section restate previous density estimation algorithms scheff\'e tournament winner minimum distance estimate using test-functions
next section present our algorithms
first one modification minimum-distance estimate improved quadratic  computational cost
second one call ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' only linear computational cost after preprocessing
section explore randomized density estimation algorithms
final section give examples showing tightness theorems stated previous sections
throughout paper focus case when finite order compare computational costs our estimates previous ones
however our results generalize straightforward way infinite classes well if ignore computational complexity
