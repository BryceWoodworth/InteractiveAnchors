paper describe implementation efficient algorithm proposed  based singular value decomposition followed local manifold optimization solving low-rank matrix completion problem
been shown if number revealed entries large enough output singular value decomposition gives good estimate original matrix so local optimization reconstructs correct matrix high probability
present numerical results show algorithm reconstruct low rank matrix exactly very small subset its entries
further study robustness algorithm respect noise its performance actual collaborative filtering datasets
 introduction 
paper consider problem reconstructing low rank matrix small set observed entries
problem considerable practical interest many applications
one example collaborative filtering where users submit rankings small subsets say movies goal infer preference unrated movies recommendation system
believed movie-rating matrix approximately low-rank since only few factors contribute userâ€™s preferences
other examples matrix completion include problem inferring 3-dimensional structure motion triangulation incomplete data distances between wireless sensors also known sensor localization problem
