let space all samples cardinality consider sets wide samples ie  hypersets defined \ a_{\beta h}  \{s\mathbb{s}_\ell: \w_{s}(h \beta\} \ through application sauer-shelah result density sets upper estimate obtained growth function trace class   ie  number possible dichotomies obtained intersecting all hypersets fixed collection samples cardinality

 introduction 
any logical expression denote indicator function takes value whenever statement true false respectively
let any fixed positive integer define space all samples size
consider sets wide samples i e  refer sets hypersets
will convenient associate sets indicator functions denoted referred hyperconcepts may write brevity
any fixed width parameter define hyperclass } words consists all sets subsets cardinality corresponding binary functions wide at least
aim paper compute complexity hyperclass corresponds class
since domain infinite then so hence one cannot simply measure its cardinality
instead apply standard combinatorial measure complexity family sets follows: suppose general domain infinite class subsets
any subset let \gamma_\mg(s |\mg_{|s}| where
growth function see instance  defined measures rate number dichotomies obtained intersecting subsets finite set increases function cardinality maximal case also called trace 
since interested hypersets opposed simple sets above then consider trace finite collection samples instead finite sample above
will convenient define cardinality collection cardinality union its component sets i e  any given finite collection let |\zeta|  \left|\bigcup_{s: s\in\zeta} s\right| use denote possible value
measure complexity compute growth function  i e
