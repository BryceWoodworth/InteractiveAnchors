missing entries incomplete real valued matrix recovered
clearly matrix completed infinite number ways replacing missing entries arbitrary values
order completion question any value must restrict matrix belong certain class matrices
popular class matrices matrices limited rank problem completing low-rank matrix subset its entries received great deal attention lately
completion problem comes up naturally variety settings
one netflix problem  where users submit rankings only small subset movies one would like infer their preference unrated movies
data matrix all user-ratings may approximately low-rank because believed only few factors contribute individual's preferences
completion problem also arises computer vision problem inferring three-dimensional structure motion  well many other data analysis machine learning  control other problems modeled factor model
numerous completion algorithms been proposed over years see eg 
many algorithms relax non-convex rank constraint convex set semidefinite positive matrices solve convex optimization problem using semidefinite programming sdp
recently using techniques compressed sensing  cand\`es recht proved if pattern missing entries random then minimization convex nuclear norm norm singular values vector finds high probability exact completion most matrices rank long number observed entries satisfies  where some function
even more recently keshavan oh montanari improved bound also provided efficient completion algorithm
fascinating recent results do not provide however solution more practical case pattern missing entries non-random
given specific pattern missing entries extremely desirable would algorithm determine uniqueness rank matrix completion
prior running any numerous existing completion algorithms sdp important analyst know if completion indeed unique
building ideas rigidity theory see eg   propose efficient randomized algorithm determines whether not possible uniquely complete incomplete matrix matrix specified rank
our proposed algorithm does not attempt complete matrix but only determines if unique completion possible
introduce new matrix call completion matrix serves analogue rigidity matrix rigidity theory
rank completion matrix determines property call infinitesimal completion
whenever completion matrix large sparse its rank efficiently determined using iterative methods lsqr
rigidity theory will also make distinction between local completion global completion
analogy between rigidity completion quite striking believe many results rigidity theory usefully translated completion setup
