 
classification problem described joint density  models ``bayesian similarity measure'' been shown optimal similarity measure nearest neighbor classification
paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties conditional distribution
paper first shows reconstruct up class labels class posterior distribution given  gives procedure recovering class labels gives asymptotically bayes-optimal classification procedure
also shows given optimal similarity measure how construct classifier outperforms nearest neighbor classifier achieves bayes-optimal classification rates
paper then analyzes bayesian similarity framework where classifier faces number related classification tasks multitask learning illustrates reconstruction class posterior distribution not possible general
finally paper identifies distinct class classification problems using shows using solve those problems bayes optimal solution
 introduction 
statistical models similarity become increasingly important recent work information retrieval  case-based reasoning  pattern recognition  computer vision
particular interest bayesian similarity discriminatively trained model  will abbreviate
models been demonstrated work well number pattern recognition visual object recognition problems
easy see nearest neighbor classification using minimizes risk class labels differ therefore optimal 1-nearest neighbor classification
however beyond observation there been several kinds analysis bayesian similarity
first presented mahamud analysis considering single instance classification problem determined joint distribution class labels feature vectors
authors also argue existence useful invariance properties bayesian similarity functions when those functions specific form
second analysis based hierarchical bayesian framework presented breuel  effectively considers bayesian similarity context distribution related classification tasks
paper analyzes relationship between bayesian similarity class posterior distribution both non-hierarchical hierarchical cases uses those results construct asymptotically bayes-optimal classification procedure using bayesian similarity
also presents new statistical model kinds discrimination tasks described demonstrates bayesian similarity bayes-optimal solution those tasks
implications results applications bayesian similarity will discussed at end
