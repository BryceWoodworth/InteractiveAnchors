 introduction 
study tracking problem numerous applications ai control finance
tracking given noisy measurements over time problem estimate hidden state object
challenge do reliably combining measurements multiple time steps prior knowledge about state dynamics goal tracking produce estimates close true states possible
most popular solutions tracking problem kalman filter  particle filter  their numerous extensions variations  eg   based generative framework tracking problem
suppose want track state object at time  given only measurement vectors \changeto{at time}{for times}
generative approach think state measurements random variables
represent our knowledge regarding dynamics states using transition process our knowledge regarding noisy relationship between states observations measurement process
then given only observations goal tracking estimate hidden state sequence
done calculating likelihood each state sequence then using estimate either sequence highest posterior probability maximum posteriori map expected value state respect posterior distribution bayesian algorithm
practice one uses particle filters approximation bayesian algorithm
problem generative framework practice very difficult precisely determine distributions measurements
moreover bayesian algorithm very sensitive model mismatches \changeto{and}{so} using model slightly different model generating measurements lead large divergence between estimated states true states
address introduce online-learning-based framework tracking
our framework called framework given set state sequences paths state space; but instead assuming observations \changeto{generated}{ generated } measurement model \changeto{ path set }{a path set} think each path mechanism explaining observations
emphasize done regardless how observations generated
suppose \changeto{that the}{a} path \changeto{ }{ } proposed explanation observations \changeto{ }{ } \changeto{then we}{we} measure quality \explanatory\ path using predefined loss function  depends only measurements not hidden true state
tracking algorithm selects its own \explanatory\ path taking weighted average best \explanatory\ paths according past observations
theoretical guarantee provide loss \explanatory\ path generated online way tracking algorithm close \explanatory\ path minimum \changeto{loss where}{such loss; here,} loss measured according loss function supplied algorithm
guarantees analogous competitive analysis used online learning  important note guarantees hold uniformly any sequence observations regardless any probabilistic assumptions
our next contribution provide online-learning-based algorithm tracking \explanatory\ framework
our algorithm based \nhedge  general online learning algorithm \nhedge\ instantiated any loss function
when supplied bounded loss function guaranteed produce path loss close path minimum loss set candidate paths
inefficient directly apply \nhedge\ tracking derive sequential \changeto{monte-carlo-based}{monte carlo} approximation \nhedge show approximation efficient
demonstrate robustness our tracking algorithm perform simulations simple one-dimensional tracking problem
evaluate tracking performance measuring average distance between states estimated algorithms true hidden states
instantiate our algorithm simple clipping loss function
our simulations show our algorithm consistently outperforms bayesian algorithm under high measurement noise wide range levels model mismatch
note bayesian algorithm also interpreted \explanatory\ framework
particular if loss path negative log-likelihood log-loss under some measurement model then bayesian algorithm shown produce path log-loss close path minimum log-loss
one may tempted think our tracking solution follows same approach; however point our paper one use loss functions different log-loss particular show scenario \changeto{where}{in which} using other loss functions produces better tracking performance than bayesian algorithm its approximations
