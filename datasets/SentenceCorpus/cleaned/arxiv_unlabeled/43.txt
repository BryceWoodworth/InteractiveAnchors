 introduction 
research chaotic dynamical systems during last forty years produced new vision origins randomness
now widely understood observed randomness generated low-dimensional deterministic systems exhibit chaotic attractor
today when confronted what appears high-dimensional stochastic process one now asks whether not process instead hidden low-dimensional but nonlinear dynamical system
awareness though requires new way looking at apparently random data since chaotic dynamics very sensitive measurement process  both blessing curse turns out
symbolic dynamics one suite tools dynamical systems theory its most basic form addresses issue considering coarse-grained view continuous dynamics  sense any finite-precision instrument measures chaotic system induces symbolic representation underlying continuous-valued behavior
effectively model time series discrete data continuous-state system two concerns must addressed
first must consider measurement instrument representation true dynamics provides
second must consider inference models based data
relation between steps more subtle than one might expect
will demonstrate one hand measurement chaotic data instrument should designed maximize entropy rate resulting data stream
allows one extract much information each measurement possible
other hand model inference strives minimize apparent randomness entropy rate over class alternative models
reflects search determinism structure data
here address interplay between optimal instruments optimal models analyzing relatively simple nonlinear system
consider design binary-output instruments chaotic maps additive noise
then use bayesian inference th order markov chain model resulting data stream
our model system one-dimensional chaotic map additive noise } where   gaussian random variable mean zero variance
start consider design instruments zero-noise limit
regime most previous work symbolic dynamics provides convenient frame reference
construction symbolic dynamics representation continuous-state system goes follows
assume time discrete consider map state space itself
space partitioned into finite set nonoverlapping regions many ways
most powerful called markov partition must satisfy two conditions
first image each region must union intervals:
second map  restricted interval must one-to-one onto
if markov partition cannot found system under consideration next best coarse-graining called generating partition
one dimensional maps often easily found using extrema its critical points
critical points map used divide state space into intervals over monotone
note markov partitions generating but converse not generally true
given any partition  then series continuous-valued states projected onto its symbolic representation
latter simply associated sequence partition-element indices
done defining operator returns unique each alphabet when
central result symbolic dynamics establishes using generating partition increasingly long sequences observed symbols identify smaller smaller regions state space
starting system region produces associated measurement sequence
limit infinite sequences result discrete-symbol representation continuous-state system---a representation will show often much easier analyze
way chosen partition creates sequence describes continuous dynamics sequence symbols
choice partition then equivalent our instrument-design problem
effectiveness partition zero noise limit quantified estimating entropy rate resulting symbolic sequence
do consider length words
block entropy length sequences obtained partition then } where probability observing word
block entropy entropy rate estimated following limit } practice often more accurate calculate length estimate entropy rate using } another key result symbolic dynamics says entropy original continuous system found using generating partitions
particular true entropy rate maximizes estimated entropy rates: } thus translated into statement about experiment design results tell us design instrument so maximizes observed entropy rate
reflects fact want each measurement produce most information possible
useful benchmark useful only case when know  piesin's identity  tells us value equal sum positive lyapunov characteristic exponents:
one-dimensional maps there single lyapunov exponent numerically estimated map observed trajectory using } taken altogether results tell us how design our instrument effective observation deterministic chaos
notably presence noise no theorems exist
however demonstrated methods developed above robust presence noise
any case view output instrument stochastic process
sample realization length measurements taken finite alphabet basis our inference problem:
our purposes here sample generated partition continuous-state sequences iterations one-dimensional map states chaotic attractor
means particular stochastic process stationary
assume addition alphabet binary
