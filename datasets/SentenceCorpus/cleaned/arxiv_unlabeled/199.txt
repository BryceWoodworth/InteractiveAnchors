 introduction 
common procedure sampling surveys partitioning elements population before distributing sample way obtain most useful information data collected
procedure called stratification
may different aims guarantee obtaining information some all geopolitical regions country provide more precision estimating population quantities identifying strata more homogeneous elements into them according one more variables
latter case stratification also called statistical stratification
principal use statistical stratification order obtain better precision defining what percentage sample must taken each stratum once chosen non-uniform allocation scheme non-trivial functional relation between size each stratum number sample units collected
thus important consider allocation scheme itself order do suitable statistical stratification
paper propose exact algorithm solve statistical stratification problem call simply stratification problem considering simple non-uniform allocation scheme
specifically method intends solve problem optimal stratification stratified simple random sampling without replacement using proportional allocation
problem must divide population size into strata considering auxiliary variable  also called size variable whose values known all units population
first stratum defined set units population whose values lower than equal constant value  second one set units whose values greater than lower than equal so
based definition stratum defined set units population values belonging interval  where boundaries each stratum stratum corresponds set observations values greater than
problem optimal stratification consists find boundaries minimize variance estimator total one more variables study supposed some correlation variable even variable properly
aiming solve problem new algorithm when proportional allocation used proposed using idea minimal path graphs
paper organized five sections
section 2 present some basic concepts about stratified simple random sampling
section 3 define problem stratification tackled work offer brief discussion about different approaches topic
propose section 4 algorithm based graph theory order provide exact solutions stratification problem defined section 3
finally present some computational results considerations about new algorithm
