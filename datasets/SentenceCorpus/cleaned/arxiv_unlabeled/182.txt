 introduction 
vision future network management involve nodes make intelligent decisions allocating resources controlling traffic flows
includes admitting new flows preempting less important existing flows well studied policy based admission control i e  admission based priority flows
specifically preemption defined at prioritized multi-class network where new call needs set up high priority between source s destination d
when capacity insufficient at all feasible routes between source-destination s-d pair some existing flows lower priorities need forced reduce their bandwidth move lowest service class e g  best-effort-service simply preempted accommodate new call
preemption decisions decide lower priority flows remove free reserved bandwidth new call at chosen route
goal decide whether preempt active flow so total preempted bandwidth minimal under constraints bandwidth demand new call available free bandwidth at each link \\ benefit preemption been described prior works
example preemption allows new high-priority connection access heavily crowded core networks eg  multi-protocol label switched mpls networks
connection preemption also improves resource utilization allowing low-priority flows access unused bandwidths
preemption sees potential applications emerging networks
example 802 11e wireless lan delay sensitive ip packets expedited forwarding ef class served earlier than best-effort packets through preemption
multi-level preemption precedence mlpp proposed classify calls their importance used military well commercial networks \\ there two significant challenges preemption performance complexity
performance corresponds whether right flows preempted result minimal bandwidth accommodate new flow
complexity corresponds amount information needed preemption decision
preemption known np-complete
complexity results large number active flows supported core network preemption decisions need made
example 1gbps link if bandwidth each flow order kbps there would thousands flows supported per link
addition flow generally passes through multiple nodes making preemption decisions among nodes dependent thus difficult done local information
thus preemption network-centric may require huge amount information perform large network \\ centralized preemption decisions centralized node maintains routed-path information active flows their priorities bandwidth occupancies at entire route
centralized node then decides active flows preempt upon request new call
therefore centralized preemption always optimal resulting minimal preempted bandwidth
but amount management information needed overwhelming at centralized node
example let total number distinct flows per priority class at route new call
each flow two states preempted not preempted
total number possible states making centralized decision
when order hundreds thousands  centralized preemption becomes computationally intractable
decentralized preemption then adopted reducing amount management information \\ decentralized preemption done at each node individually thus requires node maintain its local information i e  active flows at adjacent links their priorities bandwidth occupancy
information available locally at nodes
node then decides independently other nodes connections preempt
however may cause conflicting local decisions same flows pass multiple links route resulting more preempted bandwidth than necessary
other words decentralized preemption decision neglects spatial dependence flows across multiple links may perform poorly
but amount management information greatly reduced compared centralized preemption
example let maximum number active flows per link
total number states at each link
since  compared centralized preemption decentralized schemes much smaller search space preemption decisions
therefore most algorithms literature focus decentralized preemption see references there \\ work studies distributed decisions take into account spatial dependence among neighboring links through local information exchange
fact distributed preemption considered generalization centralized decentralized preemption
centralized preemption corresponds one extreme case distributed preemption entire route neighborhood information exchange; whereas decentralized decisions correspond another extreme case where neighborhood size zero
therefore communication complexity characterized terms neighborhood size
there trade-off between optimality complexity \\ general been shown difficult problem develop distributed algorithm whose performance predictable within tolerable degradation i e  given error bound optimal scheme
hence open issues are: when distributed decisions collectively result near-optimal global preemption b how model large number dependent decision variables obtain near-optimal local decisions using distributed algorithms
apply machine learning study issues \\ {machine learning perspective:} machine learning view distributed preemption individual nodes ``learn make decisions" collectively iteratively
ideally if each node complete information all active flows at route new flow node will able make correct decisions flows preempt
however at any given time node only partial information active flows route its neighbors' decisions flows preempt
but node adapt i e  learn make decisions based those its neighbors'
neighbors learn neighbors' neighbors node would indirectly learn what farther nodes decide only delay
eventually all nodes would make local decisions collectively resulting near-optimal preemption at entire route \\ how would machine learning benefit distributed preemption
problem collective learning decision-making been keen interest machine learning adaptive control  but just begun see applications networking
particular proposes using markov random fields general model decision-making ad hoc wireless networks
model then applied routing wireless networks
our prior work obtain probabilistic graphical models ad hoc wireless wireline networks starting network properties  resulting probabilistic models turn out multi-layer
work focuses distributed decisions network flows
view machine learning framework large number decision variables treated jointly
spatial dependence among variables poses key challenge preemption origin high communication complexity not been dealt sufficiently prior works
machine learning provides feasible approaches problem summarized below \\ global model distributed preemption decisions: first develop probabilistic model represents explicitly spatial dependence distributed preemption decisions over pre-determined preempting route new flow
randomness results randomly arriving/departing active flows their locations
preemption decisions made flows at each node also random due incomplete inaccurate local information distributed preemption
first obtain cost function preemption ``hamiltonian" ``system potential energy"
hamiltonian combines local preemption decisions constraints into single quantity
constraints include link capacity unused bandwidths bandwidth-demand new flow at each link
hamiltonian then used obtain spatial probabilistic model gibbs distribution \\ b markov random field mrf sufficient conditions: spatial dependence characterized through probabilistic dependency graph graphical models machine learning
probabilistic dependency graph provides simple yet explicit representation spatial dependence among random variables
show if dependence decision variables spatially markovian globally optimal preemption decision obtained collectively iterative local decisions through information exchange only neighboring nodes
probabilistic model known markov random field
general distributed decisions may not spatially markov since spatial dependence caused flows across multiple links
hence identify traffic patterns active flows result approximately spatial markov dependence
then define near-optimality distributed decisions difference between centralized distributed decisions measured hamiltonian obtain sufficient conditions difference reside within error bound \\ c distributed decision algorithm: near-optimal distributed algorithm derived based markov random field
algorithms implemented through either message passing gibbs sampling \\ d trade-offs: challenging issue performance-complexity trade-off i e  ``when" ``how" distributed preemption achieve near-optimal performance moderate complexity
here performance measures optimality distributed preemption decision relative centralized optimal decision
communication complexity distributed preemption characterized amount information used distributed decision making
distributed decisions reduce complexity using information exchange only neighbors but may deviate optimal performance
hence study performance complexity trade-off through both analysis simulation \\ rest paper organized follows
