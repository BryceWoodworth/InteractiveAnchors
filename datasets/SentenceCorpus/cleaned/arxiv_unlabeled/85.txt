context classical data analysis knowledge discovery based calculating center gravity not used because input not vectors
paper present application real world symbolic data using self-organizing map
end %%@ propose extension self-organizing map handle symbolic data \\ keywords: classification self organizing map symbolic data dissimilarity
 introduction 
self-organizing map(som introduced kohonen unsupervised neural network method both clustering visualization %%@ properties
considered algorithm maps high dimensional data space  lower dimension generally 2 %%@ called map
projection enables input data partitioned into "similar" clusters while preserving their topology
its most similar %%@ predecessors k-means algorithm dynamic clustering method  operate som without topology preservation %%@ therefore without easy visualization
data analysis new forms complex data considered most notably symbolic data data internal structure interval %%@ data distributions functional data etc  semi-structured data trees xml documents sql queries etc 
context classical data %%@ analysis based calculating center gravity not used because input not vectors
order solve problem %%@ several methods considered depending type data example projection operators %%@ functional data 
however those methods not fully general adaptation every data analysis algorithm resulting %%@ data needed
kohonen's som based center gravity notion unfortunately concept not applicable many kinds complex data
paper propose adaptation som dissimilarity data alternative solution
our goal modify som algorithm allow its implementation dissimilarity measures rather than raw data
end take one's inspiration work kohonen
apply method only definition dissimilarity each type data necessary so complex data processed
