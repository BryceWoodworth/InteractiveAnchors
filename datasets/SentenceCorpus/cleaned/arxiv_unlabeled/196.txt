 
recently different works proposed new way mine patterns databases pathological size
example experiments genome biology usually provide databases thousands attributes genes but only tens objects experiments
case mining ``transposed'' database runs through smaller search space galois connection allows infer closed patterns original database
focus here constrained pattern mining those unusual databases give theoretical framework database constraint transposition
discuss properties constraint transposition look into classical constraints
then address problem generating closed patterns original database satisfying constraint starting those mined ``transposed'' database
finally show how generate all patterns satisfying constraint closed ones
 introduction 
frequent pattern mining now well mastered but patterns like association rules reveal too numerous experts very expensive compute
they filtered constrained
however mining constraining done jointly pushing constraint order avoid combinatorial explosion
mining under complex constraint become today hot topic subject numerous works e g  
moreover new domains interested our applications data schemes vary consequently
genome biology biological experiments very expensive time consuming
therefore only small number experiments processed
however thanks new devices biochips experiments provide measurements activity thousands genes
leads databases lots columns genes few rows experiments
numerous works present efficient algorithms mine patterns satisfying user defined constraint large databases
constraint combine minimum maximum frequency threshold together other syntactical constraints
algorithms designed databases up several millions rows
however their complexity exponential number columns thus they not suited databases too many columns like those encountered genome biology
recently two propositions were done solve problem: instead mining original database algorithms work ``transposed'' database i e  columns original database become rows ``transposed'' database rows becomes columns indeed same database but different representation
therefore ``transposed'' database significantly less columns than original one
carpenter algorithm specifically designed mining frequent closed patterns our proposition uses classical algorithm mining closed patterns monotonic anti-monotonic constraint
both approaches use transposition principle however problem mining under constraints not fully studied specially complex constraints i e  conjunction disjunction simple constraints
paper study problem theoretical point view
our aim use classical algorithms constrained pattern mining algorithms closed patterns mining algorithms ``transposed'' database use their output regenerate patterns original database instead directly mining original database
there several interesting questions will therefore try answer: what kind information gathered ``transposed'' database patterns original database
possible ``transpose'' constraints i e  given database constraint possible find ``transposed'' constraint mining ``transposed'' database ``transposed'' constraint gives information about patterns satisfy original constraint original database
how regenerate closed patterns original database patterns extracted ``transposed'' database
how generate all itemsets satisfying constraint using extracted closed patterns
questions will addressed respectively sec  
organization paper follows: start sec  recalling some usual definitions related pattern mining galois connection
then show sec  how transpose usual complex constraints
section complete discussion about mining constrained closed patterns using ``transposed'' database sec  show how use compute all i e  not only closed patterns satisfying constraint
finally sec  short conclusion
