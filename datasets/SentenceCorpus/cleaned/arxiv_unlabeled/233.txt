describe application temporal data mining analyzing fault logs engine assembly plant
frequent episode discovery framework model-free method used deduce temporal correlations among events logs efficient manner
addition being theoretically elegant computationally efficient frequent episodes also easy interpret form actionable recommendations
incorporation domain-specific information critical successful application method analyzing fault logs manufacturing domain
show how domain-specific knowledge incorporated using heuristic rules act pre-filters post-filters frequent episode discovery
system described here currently being used one engine assembly plants general motors planned adaptation other plants
best our knowledge paper presents first real large-scale application temporal data mining manufacturing domain
believe ideas presented paper help practitioners engineer tools analysis other similar related application domains well
 introduction 
automotive engine assembly heavily automated complex process controlled distributed fashion
each assembly plant consists several machines operations/stations extensively inter-connected programmed automatically execute various operations necessary manufacture automotive engine
distributed control system maintains elaborate logs regarding time-evolving conditions all machines plant status different operations performed particular engine throughput statistics plant etc
paper present application uses temporal data mining techniques analyzing time-stamped logs help fault analysis root-cause diagnosis
application presented here currently being used regular basis engine assembly plants general motors }
