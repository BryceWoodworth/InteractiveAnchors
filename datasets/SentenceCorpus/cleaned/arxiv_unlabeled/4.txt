 introduction 
probabilistic grammatical inference supposed data arise form finite set words  built predefinite alphabet  independently drawn according fixed unknown distribution law called stochastic language
then usual goal try infer estimate distribution law some class probabilistic models probabilistic automata pa same expressivity hidden markov models hmm
pa identifiable limit
however our knowledge there exists no efficient inference algorithm able deal whole class stochastic languages generated pa
most previous works use restricted subclasses pa probabilistic deterministic automata pda
other hand probabilistic automata particular cases multiplicity automata  stochastic languages generated multiplicity automata special cases rational languages call rational stochastic languages
ma been used grammatical inference variant exact learning model angluin but not probabilistic grammatical inference
let us design  class rational stochastic languages over semiring
when  exactly class stochastic languages generated pa parameters
but when  obtain strictly greater classes provide several advantages at least one drawback: elements may significantly smaller representation clearly advantage learning perspective; elements minimal normal representation while normal representations do not exist pa; parameters minimal representations directly related probabilities some natural events form  efficiently estimated stochastic samples; lastly when field rational series over form vector space efficient linear algebra techniques used deal rational stochastic languages
however class presents serious drawback : there exists no recursively enumerable subset ma exactly generates
moreover class representations unstable: arbitrarily close ma generates stochastic language may find ma whose associated rational series takes negative values not absolutely convergent: global weight may unbounded not absolutely defined
however show strongly identifiable limit: design algorithm dees any target given access infinite sample drawn according  will converge finite but unbounded number steps minimal normal representation
moreover dees efficient: runs within polynomial time size input computes minimal number parameters classical statistical rates convergence
however before converging target dees output ma close target but do not compute stochastic languages
question is: what kind guarantees do intermediary hypotheses how use them probabilistic inference purpose
show since algorithm aims at building minimal normal representation target intermediary hypotheses output dees nice property: they absolutely converge 1 i e
consequence defined without ambiguity any  shown tends 0 learning proceeds
given any series  efficiently compute stochastic language  not rational but property any word
our conclusion despite fact no recursively enumerable class ma represents class rational stochastic languages ma used efficiently infer stochastic languages
classical notions stochastic languages rational series multiplicity automata recalled section
study example shows representation rational stochastic languages ma real parameters may very concise
introduce our inference algorithm dees section show strongly indentifiable limit
study properties ma output dees section show they define absolutely convergent rational series used compute stochastic languages estimates target
