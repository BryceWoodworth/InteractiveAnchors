 introduction 
traditional supervised learning  object represented instance
i e  feature vector associated class label
formally let
denote instance space feature space set class labels
task learn function given data set
 where instance known label
although formalization prevailing successful there many real-world
problems do not fit framework well
particular each object
framework belongs only one concept therefore corresponding instance
associated single class label
however many real-world objects complicated
may belong multiple concepts simultaneously
example image belong
several classes simultaneously eg  grasslands  lions 
africa  etc ; text document classified several categories if
viewed different aspects eg  scientific novel  jules verne's
writing even books traveling ; web page recognized
news page  sports page  soccer page  etc
specific real
task maybe only one multiple concepts right semantic meaning

example image retrieval when user interested image lions s/he may
only interested concept lions instead other concepts
grasslands africa associated image
difficulty here
caused those objects involve multiple concepts
choose right semantic meaning objects specific scenario fundamental difficulty many tasks
contrast starting large universe all possible concepts involved task may helpful get subset concepts associated concerned object at first then make choice small subset later
however getting subset concepts assigning proper class labels objects still challenging task
notice alternative representing object single instance
many cases possible represent complicated object using set instances
example multiple patches extracted image where each patch
described instance thus image represented set instances;
multiple sections extracted document where each section described
instance thus document represented set instances; multiple
links extracted web page where each link described instance
thus web page represented set instances
using multiple instances
represent those complicated objects may helpful because some inherent patterns
closely related some labels may become explicit clearer
paper propose miml  multi-instance multi-label learning 
framework where example described multiple instances associated
multiple class labels
compared traditional learning frameworks miml framework more convenient
natural representing complicated objects
exploit advantages miml
representation new learning algorithms needed
propose \textsc{mimlboost}
algorithm \textsc{mimlsvm} algorithm based simple degeneration strategy
experiments show solving problems involving complicated objects multiple
semantic meanings under miml framework lead good performance
considering
degeneration process may lose information also propose
\textsc{d-mimlsvm} i e  direct \textsc{mimlsvm} algorithm tackles miml
problems directly regularization framework
experiments show ``direct''
algorithm outperforms ``indirect'' \textsc{mimlsvm} algorithm
some practical tasks do not access real objects themselves
real images real web pages; instead given observational data where
each real object already been represented single instance
thus cases
cannot capture more information real objects using miml representation
even situation however miml still useful
propose \textsc{insdif}
i e  instance differentiation algorithm transforms single-instances into miml
examples learning
algorithm able achieve better performance than
learning single-instances directly some tasks
not strange because
object associated multiple class labels if described only single
instance information corresponding labels mixed thus difficult
learning; if transform single-instance into set instances some
proper ways mixed information might detached some extent thus less
difficult learning
miml also helpful learning single-label objects
propose
\textsc{subcod} i e  sub-concept discovery algorithm works discovering
sub-concepts target concept at first then transforming data into miml
examples learning
algorithm able achieve better performance than
learning single-label examples directly some tasks
also not strange
because label corresponding high-level complicated concept may quite
difficult learn concept directly since many different lower-level concepts
mixed; if transform single-label into set labels corresponding some
sub-concepts relatively clearer easier learning learn
labels at first then derive high-level complicated label based them
less difficulty
