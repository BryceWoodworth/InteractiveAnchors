classical results lai-robbins auer et al  imply logarithmic regret bound lipschitz mab problem finite metric spaces
recent results continuum-armed bandit problems their generalizations imply lower bounds  stronger many infinite metric spaces unit interval
dichotomy universal
prove answer yes: every metric space optimal regret lipschitz mab algorithm either bounded above any  bounded below any
perhaps surprisingly dichotomy does not coincide distinction between finite infinite metric spaces; instead depends whether completion metric space compact countable
our proof connects upper lower bound techniques online learning classical topological notions perfect sets cantor-bendixson theorem
also consider full-feedback k  best-expert  version lipschitz mab problem termed lipschitz experts problem  show problem exhibits similar dichotomy
proceed give nearly matching upper lower bounds regret lipschitz experts problem uncountable metric spaces
bounds form  where exponent depends metric space
characterize dependence introduce novel dimensionality notion tailored experts problem
finally show both lipschitz bandits lipschitz experts problems become completely intractable sense no algorithm regret  if only if completion metric space non-compact
 introduction 
multi-armed bandit henceforth mab problems been studied more than fifty years clean setting analyzing exploration-exploitation tradeoffs common sequential decision making
stochastic mab problem  algorithm must repeatedly choose fixed set strategies k ``arms" each time receiving random payoff whose distribution depends strategy selected
performance mab algorithms commonly evaluated terms regret : difference expected payoff between algorithm's choices always playing one fixed strategy
addition their many applications  range experimental design online auctions web advertising  another appealing feature multi-armed bandit algorithms they surprisingly efficient terms growth rate regret: finite-armed bandit problems algorithms whose regret at time scales been known more than two decades beginning seminal work lai robbins extended subsequent work
many applications mab problems  especially computer science applications online auctions web advertising adaptive routing  require considering strategy sets very large even infinite
infinite strategy sets bound does not apply while very large finite sets notation masks prohibitively large constant
indeed without making any assumptions about strategies their payoffs bandit problems large strategy sets allow no non-trivial solutions  any mab algorithm performs badly some inputs random guessing
motivates study bandit problems strategy set large but one given side information constraining form payoffs
problems become subject quite intensive study recent years eg 
lipschitz mab problem version stochastic mab problem side information consists priori upper bounds difference expected payoff between certain pairs strategies
models situations where decision maker access some similarity information about strategies ensures similar strategies obtain similar payoffs
abstractly similarity information may modeled defining metric space structure strategy set side constraints imply expected payoff function lipschitz function lipschitz constant  metric space
% lipschitz constant
lipschitz mab problem was introduced kleinberg et al 
preceding work studied problem few specific metric spaces one-dimensional real interval
prior work considered regret function time  focused asymptotic dependence loosely speaking dimensionality metric space
various upper lower bounds form were proved where exponent depends metric space
particular if metric space interval standard metric  then there exists algorithm regret  bound tight up polylog factors
more generally arbitrary infinite metric space one define isometry invariant there exists algorithm regret  tight up polylog factors if ; see
following picture emerges
although algorithms regret known most metric spaces existing work unfortunately provides no examples infinite metric spaces admitting bandit algorithms satisfying lai-robbins regret bound  although bound holds all finite metrics
fact most metric spaces been studied unit interval possibility excluded known lower bounds form where therefore natural ask regret best possible infinite metric space
alternatively there infinite metric spaces one achieve regret
there any metric space best possible regret between
% any metric space \xhdr{our contributions } make above issue more concrete let us put forward following definition
settle questions listed above proving following dichotomy
worth mentioning regret bound best possible even two-armed bandit problems lower bound lai robbins
thus our upper bound lipschitz mab problems compact countable metric spaces nearly best possible bound spaces modulo gap between `` " `` "
furthermore show gap inevitable infinite metric spaces: turn our attention full-feedback version lipschitz mab problem
any mab problem there exists corresponding full-feedback problem after each round payoffs all strategies revealed
settings been extensively studied online learning literature under name best experts problems 
particular finite set strategies one achieve constant regret when payoffs iid
over time
addition full feedback one could also consider version payoffs revealed some but not all strategies
specifically define double feedback  where each round algorithm selects two strategies: ``bet" receives payoff ``free peek"
after round payoffs revealed both strategies
abuse notation will treat bandit setting special case experts setting
experts version lipschitz mab problem called lipschitz experts problem  defined obvious way: problem instance specified triple  where metric space borel probability measure set payoff functions borel algebra induced product topology  expected payoff function lipschitz function
each round algorithm presented iid

metric structure known algorithm measure not
show lipschitz experts problem exhibits dichotomy similar one theorem
formulate upper bound double feedback lower bound full feedback thus avoiding issue what means algorithm receive feedback infinitely many strategies
theorems assert dichotomy between metric spaces lipschitz mab/experts problem very tractable those somewhat tractable
let us consider opposite end ``tractability spectrum" ask metric spaces problem becomes completely intractable
obtain precise characterization: problem completely intractable if only if metric space not pre-compact
moreover our upper bound bandit setting whereas lower bound full feedback
consider \ffproblem
view lower bound theorems interested matching upper bounds
gupta et al  observed bounds hold every metric space finite covering dimension: namely lipschitz experts problem tractable their algorithm version ``naive algorithm''  therefore natural ask whether there exist metric spaces optimal regret lipschitz experts problem between

instance {ucb1} admits instance-specific guarantee  whereas best-known instance-independent guarantee algorithm only  where number arms
accordingly lower bound instance-independent version show any algorithm given time  there exists problem instance whose regret large at time whereas instance-specific version one needs much more ambitious argument: any algorithm there exists problem instance whose regret large infinitely often
paper focus instance-specific guarantees \omit{ %%%%%%%% apart stochastic mab problem considered paper several other formulations been studied literature multi-armed bandits spans operations research economics computer science see background } %%%%%%%%% apart stochastic mab problem considered paper several other mab formulations been studied literature see background
early work focused bayesian formulations bayesian priors payoffs known goal maximize payoff expectation over priors
formulations mab instance markov decision process mdp each arm represented markov chain rewards states transition happens whenever arm played
more ``difficult" restless bandits formulations state also changes when arm passive according another transition matrix
theoretical computer science literature recent work vein includes
interestingly bayesian formulations offline flavor: given mdp one needs efficiently compute nearly optimal mapping states actions
contrasting bayesian formulations probabilistic model fully specified adversarial mab problem  makes no stochastic assumptions whatsoever
instead makes very pessimistic assumption payoffs chosen adversary access algorithm's code but not its random seed
stochastic mab problem goal minimize regret
any fixed finite number arms best possible regret setting 
infinite strategy sets one often considers linear mab problem strategies lie convex subset  each round payoffs form linear function \omit{ more generally convex function } open question whether ideas lipschitz mab problem extend above formulations
adversarial version lipschitz mab problem well-defined but best our knowledge only known result ``naive" algorithm
one could define stochastic version linear mab problem expected payoffs form fixed time-invariant linear function viewed special case lipschitz mab problem
however view not likely fruitful because lipschitz mab problem measuring payoff one arm useless estimating payoffs distant arms whereas prior work linear mab problem inferences about distant arms crucial
bayesian mab problems limited similarity information not clear how model information mainly because bayesian setting similarity between arms naturally represented via correlated priors rather than metric space \omit{an oblivious adversary must fix all payoffs advance before first round; adaptive adversary sees choices made algorithm all previous rounds } \xhdr{organization paper } preliminaries section
