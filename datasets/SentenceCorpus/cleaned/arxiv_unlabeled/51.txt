 introduction 
sequential decision problems decision maker forecaster tries predict outcome certain unknown process at each discrete time instance takes action accordingly
depending outcome predicted event action taken decision maker receives reward
very often probabilistic modeling underlying process difficult
situations prediction problem formalized repeated game between decision maker environment
formulation goes back 1950's when hannan blackwell showed decision maker randomized strategy guarantees regardless outcome sequence average asymptotic reward high maximal reward one could get knowing empirical distribution outcome sequence advance
strategies called hannan consistent
prove result hannan blackwell assumed decision maker full access past outcomes
case termed full information perfect monitoring case
however many important applications decision maker limited information about past elements sequence predicted
various models limited feedback been considered literature
perhaps best known them so-called multi-armed bandit problem forecaster only informed its own reward but not actual outcome; see ba\~nos  megiddo  foster vohra  auer cesa-bianchi freund schapire  hart mas colell
example shown hannan consistency achievable case well
sequential decision problems like ones considered paper been studied different fields under various names repeated games regret minimization on-line learning prediction individual sequences sequential prediction
vocabulary different sub-communities differ
ours perhaps closest used learning theorists
general introduction survey sequential prediction problem refer cesa-bianchi lugosi
paper consider general model information available forecaster general given possibly randomized function outcome decision forecaster
well understood under what conditions hannan consistency achievable setup see piccolboni schindelhauer cesa-bianchi lugosi stoltz
roughly speaking possible whenever after suitable transformations problem reward matrix expressed linear function matrix expected feedback signals
however condition not always satisfied then natural question what best achievable performance decision maker
question was answered rustichini who characterized maximal achievable average reward guaranteed asymptotically all possible outcome sequences almost sure sense
however rustichini's proof achievability not constructive
uses approachability theorems due mertens sorin zamir seems unlikely his proof method give rise computationally efficient prediction algorithms noted conclusion
simplified efficient approachability-based strategy special case where feedback function action nature alone was shown mannor shimkin
general case simplified approachability-based strategy falls short maximal achievable average reward characterized rustuchini
goal paper develop computationally efficient forecasters general prediction problem under imperfect monitoring achieve best possible asymptotic performance
introduce several forecasting strategies exploit some specific properties problem at hand
separate four cases according whether feedback signal only depends outcome both outcome forecaster's action whether feedback signal deterministic not
design different prediction algorithms all four cases
by-product also obtain finite-horizon performance bounds explicit guaranteed rates convergence terms number rounds prediction game played
case deterministic feedback signals rates optimal up logarithmic factors
random feedback signal case do not know if possible construct forecasters significantly smaller regret
motivating example prediction problem arises naturally multi-access channels prevalent both wired wireless networks
networks communication medium shared between multiple decision makers
often technically difficult synchronize between decision makers
channel sharing protocols particular several variants spread spectrum allow multiple agents use same channel channels may interfere each other simultaneously
more specifically consider wireless system where multiple agents choose channel transmit data at any given time
quality each channel may different interference other users using channel other ``close'' channels may affect base-station reception
transmitting agent may choose channel use how much power spend every transmission
agent tradeoff between amount power wasted transmission cost having its message only partially received
transmitting agent may not receive immediate feedback how much data were received base station even if feedback received often happens much higher layer communication protocol
instead transmitting agent monitor transmissions other agents
however since transmitting agent physically far base-station other agents information about channels chosen other agents amount power they used imperfect
naturally abstracts online learning problem imperfect monitoring
paper structured follows
next section formalize prediction problem investigate introduce target quantity best achievable reward notion regret
section describe some analytical properties key function  defined section
function represents worst possible average reward given vector observations needed our analysis
section consider simplest special case when actions forecaster do not influence feedback signal moreover deterministic
case basically easy full information case obtain regret bound order high probability where number rounds prediction game
section study random feedback signals but still restriction only determined outcome
here able obtain regret order

forecaster introduced there regret order
finally section show may improved case deterministic feedback signals known optimal see
