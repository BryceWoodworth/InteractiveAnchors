 
solomonoff's central result induction prediction universal semimeasure converges rapidly probability 1 true sequence generating predictor  if latter computable
hence eligible universal sequence predictor case unknown
despite some nearby results proofs literature stronger result convergence all martin-l{\"o}f random sequences remained open
convergence result would particularly interesting natural since randomness defined terms itself
show there universal semimeasures do not converge all random sequences ie \ give partial negative answer open problem
also provide positive answer some non-universal semimeasures
define incomputable measure mixture over all computable measures enumerable semimeasure mixture over all enumerable nearly-measures
show converges all random sequences
hellinger distance measuring closeness two distributions plays central role
 introduction 
sequence prediction task defined predict next observed sequence
key concept attack general prediction problems occam's razor less extent epicurus' principle multiple explanations
former/latter may interpreted keep simplest/all theories consistent observations use theories predict
solomonoff formalized combined both principles his universal priori semimeasure assigns high/low probability simple/complex environments  hence implementing occam epicurus
formally represented mixture all enumerable semimeasures
characterization levin universal enumerable semimeasure sense multiplicatively dominates all enumerable semimeasures
solomonoff's central result if probability observing at time  given past observations computable function then universal predictor converges rapidly  probability 1 w p 1 optimal/true/informed predictor  hence represents universal predictor case unknown ``true'' distribution
convergence w p 1 tells us close sufficiently large almost all sequences
says nothing about whether convergence true any particular sequence measure 0
martin-l{\"o}f m l  randomness standard notion randomness individual sequences
m l random sequence passes all thinkable effective randomness tests eg \ law large numbers law iterated logarithm etc
particular set all random sequences measure 1
natural ask whether converges difference ratio individually all m l random sequences
clearly solomonoff's result shows convergence may at most fail set sequences measure zero
convergence result m l random sequences would particularly interesting natural context since m l randomness defined terms itself
despite several attempts solve problem  remained open
paper construct m l random sequence show existence universal semimeasure does not converge sequence hence answering open question negatively some
remains open whether there exist other universal semimeasures probably particularly interesting additional structure properties m l convergence holds
main positive contribution work construction non-universal enumerable semimeasure m l converges desired
intermediate step consider incomputable measure  defined mixture over all computable measures
show m l convergence predictor
hellinger distance measuring closeness two predictive distributions plays central role work
paper organized follows: section give basic notation results strings numbers sets functions asymptotics computability concepts prefix kolmogorov complexity define discuss concepts universal enumerable semi)measures
section summarizes solomonoff's g\'acs' results predictive convergence probability 1
both results derived bound expected hellinger sum
present improved bound expected exponentiated hellinger sum implies very strong assertions convergence rate
section investigate whether convergence all martin-l{\"o}f random sequences hold
construct m l random sequence some universal semimeasures do not converge
give non-constructive constructive proof different virtue
section present our main positive result
derive finite bound hellinger sum between  exponential randomness deficiency sequence double exponential complexity
implies predictor m l converges
finally section show non-universal asymptotically m l converges  summarize computability measure dominance properties   
section contains discussion outlook
