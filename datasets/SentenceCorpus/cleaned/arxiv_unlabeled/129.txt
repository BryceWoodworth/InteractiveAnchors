 introduction 
graphs commonly used representations complex structures including dna sequences documents text images
particular they extensively used field computer vision where many problems formulated attributed graph matching problem
here nodes graphs correspond local features image edges correspond relational aspects between features both nodes edges attributed i e they encode feature vectors
graph matching then consists finding correspondence between nodes two graphs they 'look most similar' when vertices labeled according correspondence
typically problem mathematically formulated quadratic assignment problem consists finding assignment maximizes objective function encoding local compatibilities linear term structural compatibilities quadratic term
main body research graph matching then been focused devising more accurate and/or faster algorithms solve problem approximately since np-hard); compatibility functions used graph matching typically handcrafted
interesting question arises context: if given two attributed graphs match  should optimal match uniquely determined
example assume first come two images acquired surveillance camera airport's lounge; now assume same instead come two images photographer's image database; should optimal match same both situations
if algorithm takes into account exclusively graphs matched optimal solutions will same since graph pair same both cases
standard way graph matching approached today
paper address what believe limitation approach
argue if know `conditions' under pair graphs been extracted then should take into account how graphs arising those conditions typically matched
however do not take information conditions explicitly into account since would obviously impractical
instead approach problem purely statistical inference perspective
first extract graphs number images acquired under same conditions those want solve whatever word `conditions' means e g surveillance camera photographer's database
then manually provide what understand optimal matches between resulting graphs
information then used learning algorithm learns map space pairs graphs space matches
terms quadratic assignment problem learning algorithm amounts loose language adjusting node edge compatibility functions expected optimal match test pair graphs agrees expected match they would had had they been training set
formulation learning problem consists convex quadratic program readily solvable means column generation procedure
provide experimental evidence applying learning standard graph matching algorithms significantly improves their performance
fact show learning improves upon non-learning results so dramatically linear assignment learning outperforms graduated assignment bistochastic normalisation state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm
also introducing learning graduated assignment itself obtain results improve both accuracy speed over best existing quadratic assignment relaxations
