 introduction 
regularization norm attracted lot interest recent years machine learning statistics signal processing
context least-square linear regression problem usually referred lasso 
much early effort been dedicated algorithms solve optimization problem efficiently
particular lars algorithm of~\singleemcite{lars} allows find entire regularization path i e  set solutions all values regularization parameters at cost single matrix inversion
moreover well-known justification regularization norm leads sparse solutions i e  loading vectors many zeros thus performs model selection
recent works looked precisely at model consistency lasso i e  if know data were generated sparse loading vector does lasso actually recover when number observed data points grows
case fixed number covariates lasso does recover sparsity pattern if only if certain simple condition generating covariance matrices verified
particular low correlation settings lasso indeed consistent
however presence strong correlations lasso cannot consistent shedding light potential problems procedures variable selection
adaptive versions where data-dependent weights added norm then allow keep consistency all situations
paper first derive detailed asymptotic analysis sparsity pattern selection lasso estimation procedure extends previous analysis  focusing specific decay regularization parameter
show when decay proportional  where number observations then lasso will select all variables should enter model relevant variables probability tending one exponentially fast  while selects all other variables irrelevant variables strictly positive probability
if several datasets generated same distribution were available then latter property would suggest consider intersection supports lasso estimates each dataset: all relevant variables would always selected all datasets while irrelevant variables would enter models randomly intersecting supports sufficiently many different datasets would simply eliminate them
however practice only one dataset given; but resampling methods bootstrap exactly dedicated mimic availability several datasets resampling same unique dataset
paper show when using bootstrap intersecting supports actually get consistent model estimate without consistency condition required regular lasso

finally our bolasso framework could seen voting scheme applied supports bootstrap lasso estimates; however our procedure may rather considered consensus combination scheme keep largest subset variables all regressors agree terms variable selection our case provably consistent also allows get rid potential additional hyperparameter
