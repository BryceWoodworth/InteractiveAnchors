clustering algorithms data points clustering regarded players who make decisions games
network describing relationships among data points edge-removing-and-rewiring err function employed explore neighborhood data point removes edges connecting neighbors small payoffs creates new edges neighbors larger payoffs
connections among data points vary over time
during evolution network some strategies spread network
consequence clusters formed automatically data points same evolutionarily stable strategy collected cluster so number evolutionarily stable strategies indicates number clusters
moreover experimental results demonstrated data points datasets clustered reasonably efficiently comparison other algorithms also provides indication effectiveness proposed algorithms \\ \\ keywords : unsupervised learning data clustering evolutionary game theory evolutionarily stable strategy
 introduction 
cluster analysis important branch pattern recognition widely used many fields pattern analysis data mining information retrieval image segmentation
past thirty years many excellent clustering algorithms been presented say k means  c4 5  support vector clustering svc  spectral clustering  etc  data points clustering fixed various functions designed find separating hyperplanes
recent years however significant change been made
some researchers thought about why not those data points could move themselves just like agents something collect together automatically
therefore following their ideas they created few exciting algorithms  data points move space according certain simple local rules preset advance
game theory came into being book named "theory games economic behavior" john von neumann oskar morgenstern 1940
period cooperative game was widely studied
till 1950's john nash published two well-known papers present theory non-cooperative game he proposed concept nash equilibrium proved existence equilibrium finite non-cooperative game
although non-cooperative game was established rigorous mathematics required players game must perfect rational even hyper-rational
if assumption could not hold nash equilibrium might not reached sometimes
other hand evolutionary game theory stems researches biology analyze conflict cooperation between animals plants
differs classical game theory focusing dynamics strategy change more than properties strategy equilibria does not require perfect rational players
besides important concept evolutionarily stable strategy  evolutionary game theory was defined introduced john maynard smith george r
price 1973 was often used explain evolution social behavior animals
best our knowledge problem data clustering not been investigated based evolutionary game theory
so if data points dataset considered players games could clusters formed automatically playing games among them
question attempt answer
our clustering algorithm each player hopes maximize his own payoff so he constantly adjusts his strategies observing neighbors' payoffs
course strategies evolving some strategies spread network players
finally some parts will formed automatically each same strategy used
according different strategies played data points dataset naturally collected several different clusters
remainder paper organized follows: section 2 introduces some basic concepts methods about evolutionary game theory evolutionary game graph
section 3 model based upon games evolving network proposed described specifically
section 4 gives three algorithms based model algorithms elaborated analyzed detail
section 5 introduces those datasets used experiments briefly then demonstrates experimental results algorithms
further relationship between number clusters number nearest neighbors discussed three edge-removing-and-rewiring err functions employed clustering algorithms compared
conclusion given section 6
