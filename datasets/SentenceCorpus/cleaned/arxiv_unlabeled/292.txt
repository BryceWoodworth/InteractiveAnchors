 introduction 
recent studies shown despite claims spectral scarcity actual licensed spectrum remains unoccupied long periods time
thus cognitive radio cr systems been proposed order efficiently exploit spectral holes
crs secondary users sus wireless devices intelligently monitor adapt their environment hence they able share spectrum licensed primary users pus operating whenever pus idle
three key design challenges active topics research cognitive radio networks namely distributed implementation spectral efficiency tradeoff between sensing spectrum access
previous studies tackled various aspects spectrum sensing spectrum access
 performance spectrum sensing terms throughput investigated when sus share their instantaneous knowledge channel
work studies performance different detectors spectrum sensing while spatial diversity methods proposed improving probability detecting pu sus
other aspects spectrum sensing discussed
furthermore spectrum access also received increased attention eg 
 dynamic programming approach proposed allow sus maximize their channel access time while taking into account penalty factor any collision pu
work references therein establish practice sensing time cr networks large affects access performance sus
 authors model spectrum access problem non-cooperative game propose learning algorithms find correlated equilibria game
non-cooperative solutions dynamic spectrum access also proposed while taking into account changes sus' environment arrival new pus among others
%in  when multiple sus compete spectral opportunities issues fairness efficiency arise
one hand desirable su access channel high availability
other hand effective achievable rate su decreases when contending many sus over most available channel
consequently efficiency spectrum utilization system reduces
therefore su should explore transmission opportunities other channels if available refrain transmission same channel all time
intuitively diversifying spectrum access both frequency exploring more channels time refraining continuous transmission attempts would beneficial achieving fairness among multiple sus sus experiencing poorer channel conditions not starved long run
objective paper design mechanism enables fair efficient sharing spectral resources among sus
model spectrum access cognitive radio networks repeated auction game entry monitoring costs
auctioning spectral opportunities carried out repeatedly
at beginning each period each su wishes participate spectrum access submits bid coordinator based its view channel past auction history
knowledge regarding other secondary users' activities limited due distributed nature network
resulting formulation thus dynamic game incomplete information
bidder highest bid gains spectrum access
entry fees charged all bidders who participate auction irrespective outcome auction
su also choose stay out so current round case no entry fee incurred
at end each auction period information regarding bidding allocation made available all sus turn monitoring fee incurred
achieve efficient bidding learning algorithm proposed based outcome past transactions
each su decides local actions objective increasing its long-term cost effectiveness
demonstrated through extensive simulations proposed distributed scheme outperforms myopic one-stage algorithm where su always participates spectrum access game both single channel multi-channel networks
comment order feasibility auction-based approach spectrum access practice
due commercial industrial exploitation different stake holders' interests functional architectures cognitive signaling schemes currently under discussion within standardization forums including ieee scc 41 etsi tc rrs reconfigurable radio systems
cognitive pilot channel cpc gained attention potential enabler data-aided mitigation techniques between secondary primary communication systems well mechanism support optimized radio resource data management across heterogeneous networks
cpc common control channel used provide information corresponding operators radio access technology frequencies allocated given area
