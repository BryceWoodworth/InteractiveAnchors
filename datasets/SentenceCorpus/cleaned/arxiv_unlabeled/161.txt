 introduction 
support-vector machines svms class algorithms recent years exhibited superior performance compared other pattern classification algorithms
there several formulations svm problem depending specific application svm e g  classification regression etc 
one difficulties using svms building svm requires solving constrained quadratic programming problem whose size quadratic number training examples
fact led extensive research efficient svm solvers
recently several researchers suggested using multiple computing nodes order increase computational power available solving svms
article introduce distributed svm solver based gaussian belief propagation gabp algorithm
improve original gabp algorithm reducing communication load represented number messages sent each optimization iteration aggregated messages where number data points
previously was known gabp algorithm very efficient sparse matrices
using our novel construction demonstrate algorithm exhibits very good performance dense matrices well
also show gabp algorithm used kernels thus making algorithm more powerful than what was considered previously thought possible
using extensive simulation demonstrate applicability our protocol vs state-of-the-art existing parallel svm solvers
using linux cluster up hundred machines ibm blue gene supercomputer managed solve very large data sets up hundreds thousands data point using up 1,024 cpus working parallel
our comparison shows proposed algorithm just accurate previous solvers while being significantly faster
preliminary version paper appeared poster
