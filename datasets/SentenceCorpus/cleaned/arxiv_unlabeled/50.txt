 introduction 
chapter article gives introduction mathematical theory intelligence
present aixi model parameter-free optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded arbitrary unknown environment
science artificial intelligence ai may defined construction intelligent systems their analysis
natural definition system anything input output stream
intelligence more complicated
many faces like creativity solving problems pattern recognition classification learning induction deduction building analogies optimization surviving environment language processing knowledge many more
formal definition incorporating every aspect intelligence however seems difficult
most if not all known facets intelligence formulated goal-driven more precisely maximizing some utility function
therefore sufficient study goal-driven ai; eg \ biological goal animals humans survive spread
goal ai systems should useful humans
problem except special cases know neither utility function nor environment agent will operate advance
mathematical theory coined aixi supposed solve problems
assume availability unlimited computational resources
first important observation does not make ai problem trivial
playing chess optimally solving np-complete problems become trivial but driving car surviving nature don't
because challenge itself well-define latter problems not mention presenting algorithm
other words: ai problem not yet been well defined
one may view aixi suggestion mathematical definition ai
aixi universal theory sequential decision making akin solomonoff's celebrated universal theory induction
solomonoff derived optimal way predicting future data given previous perceptions provided data sampled computable probability distribution
aixi extends approach optimal decision making agent embedded unknown environment
main idea replace unknown environmental distribution bellman equations suitably generalized universal solomonoff distribution
state space space complete histories
aixi universal theory without adjustable parameters making no assumptions about environment except sampled computable distribution
algorithmic complexity perspective aixi model generalizes optimal passive universal induction case active agents
decision-theoretic perspective aixi suggestion new implicit ``learning'' algorithm may overcome all except computational problems previous reinforcement learning algorithms
there strong arguments aixi most intelligent unbiased agent possible
outline number problem classes including sequence prediction strategic games function minimization reinforcement supervised learning how aixi model formally solve them
major drawback aixi model incomputable
overcome problem construct modified algorithm aixi still effectively more intelligent than any other time length bounded agent
computation time aixi order
other discussed topics formal definition intelligence order relation horizon problem relations aixi theory other ai approaches
article meant gentle introduction discussion aixi model
mathematically rigorous treatment many subtleties proofs see references author's works annotated bibliography section at end chapterarticle\fi particular book
section also provides references introductory textbooks original publications algorithmic information theory sequential decision theory
presents theory sequential decisions very general form called ai model actions perceptions may depend arbitrary past events
clarify connection bellman equations discuss minor parameters including size i/o spaces lifetime agent their universal choice mind
optimality ai obvious construction
how sense induction possible at all been subject long philosophical controversies
highlights epicurus' principle multiple explanations occam's razor probability theory
solomonoff elegantly unified all aspects into one formal theory inductive inference based universal probability distribution  closely related kolmogorov complexity  length shortest program computing
rapid convergence unknown true environmental distribution tight loss bounds arbitrary bounded loss functions finite alphabet shown
pareto optimality sense there no other predictor performs better equal all environments strictly better at least one also shown
view results fair say problem sequence prediction possesses universally optimal solution
active case reinforcement learning algorithms usually used if unknown
they succeed if state space either small effectively been made small generalization techniques
algorithms work only restricted e g \ markovian domains problems optimally trading off exploration versus exploitation nonoptimal learning rate prone diverge otherwise ad hoc
formal solution proposed here generalize solomonoff's universal prior include action conditions replace ai model resulting ai aixi model claim universally optimal
investigate what expect universally optimal agent clarify meanings universal  optimal  etc
other discussed topics formal definitions intelligence order relation horizon problem pareto optimality aixi
show how number ai problem classes fit into general aixi model
they include sequence prediction strategic games function minimization supervised learning
first formulate each problem class its natural way known  then construct formulation within ai model show their equivalence
then consider consequences replacing
main goal understand sense problems solved aixi
major drawback aixi incomputable more precisely only asymptotically computable makes implementation impossible
overcome problem construct modified model aixi  still superior any other time length bounded algorithm
computation time aixi order
solution requires implementation first-order logic definition universal turing machine within proof theory system
finally discuss remark some otherwise unmentioned topics general interest
remark various topics including concurrent actions perceptions choice i/o spaces treatment encrypted information peculiarities mortal embodies agents
continue outlook further research including optimality down-scaling implementation approximation elegance extra knowledge training of/for aixi 
also include some personal remarks non-computable physics number wisdom  consciousness
