 introduction 
how should measure amount information about phenomenon given us observation concerning phenomenon
both `classical' shannon information theory see chapter  algorithmic information theory start idea amount measured minimum number bits needed describe observation
but whereas shannon's theory considers description methods optimal relative some given probability distribution kolmogorov's algorithmic theory takes different nonprobabilistic approach: any computer program first computes prints string representing observation then terminates viewed valid description
amount information string then defined size measured bits shortest\/ computer program outputs string then terminates
similar definition given infinite strings but case program produces element after element forever
thus long sequence 1's } contains little information because program size about bits outputs it:  3 1415


\pi$ forever
definition would appear make amount information string other object depend particular programming language used
fortunately shown all reasonable choices programming languages lead quantification amount `absolute' information individual objects invariant up additive constant
call quantity `kolmogorov complexity' object
while regular strings small kolmogorov complexity random strings kolmogorov complexity about equal their own length
measuring complexity information terms program size turned out very powerful idea applications areas theoretical computer science logic probability theory statistics physics \paragraph{this chapter} kolmogorov complexity was introduced independently different motivations r j solomonoff born 1926 n kolmogorov 1903--1987 g
chaitin born 1943 1960/1964 1965 1966 respectively
during last forty years subject developed into major mature area research
here give brief overview subject geared towards audience specifically interested philosophy information
exception recent work kolmogorov structure function parts discussion philosophical implications all material discuss here also found standard textbook
chapter structured follows: start introductory section define kolmogorov complexity list its most important properties
do much simplified yet formally correct manner avoiding both technicalities all questions motivation why definition not another one 
followed section provides informal overview more technical topics discussed later chapter sections
final section discusses theory's philosophical implications well section discusses connection inductive inference less technical again should perhaps glossed over before delving into technicalities sections
