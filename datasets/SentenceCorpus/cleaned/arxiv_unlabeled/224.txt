learning convex body mean finding set having at most relative symmetric difference input body
prove lower bound construct hard learn family convex bodies
our construction family very simple based error correcting codes
 introduction 
consider following problem: given uniformly random points convex body  would like approximately learn body few samples possible
question throughout paper interested number samples but not computational requirements constructing approximation
our main result will show needs about samples
problem special case statistical problem inferring information about probability distribution samples
example one approximate centroid body sample size roughly linear
other hand sample size polynomial not enough approximate volume convex body within constant factor   see section here discussion
note known approximation algorithms volume e g   do not work setting they need membership oracle random points various carefully chosen subsets input body
our problem also relates work learning theory e g   where one given samples generated according say gaussian distribution each sample labeled ``positive'' ``negative'' depending whether belongs body
aside different distributions another difference between learning setting ours ours one gets only positive examples
klivans~et~al  give algorithm nearly matching lower bound learning convex bodies labeled samples chosen according gaussian distribution
their algorithm takes time they also show lower bound
problem learning convex sets uniformly random samples them was raised frieze~et~al 
they gave polynomial time algorithm learning parallelopipeds
another somewhat related direction work learnability discrete distributions kearns~et~al 
our lower bound result like  also allows membership oracle queries
note known estimating volume convex bodies requires exponential number membership queries if algorithm deterministic  implies learning bodies requires exponential number membership queries because if algorithm learn body then also estimate its volume
formally define notion learning need specify distance between bodies
natural choice our setting consider total variation distance uniform distribution each body see section 
will use term random oracle convex body black box when queried outputs uniformly random point
remarkably lower bound klivans~et~al  numerically essentially identical ours  constant
constructions similar theirs possible our particular scenario
believe our argument considerably simpler elementary compared
furthermore our construction hard learn family explicit
our construction makes use error correcting codes
our knowledge connection error correcting codes new contexts may find further applications
see section some further comparison \paragraph{an informal outline proof } idea proof find large family convex bodies satisfying two conflicting goals: 1 any two bodies family almost disjoint; 2 yet they look alike sense small sample random points any body insufficient determining one
since any two bodies almost disjoint even approximating body would allow one determine exactly
will imply also hard approximate
first construct family bodies although not almost disjoint sufficiently large symmetric difference
will then able construct family almost disjoint bodies taking products bodies first family
first family quite natural described formally sec 
consider cross polytope generalization octahedron dimensions: convex hull vectors  where unit vector th coordinate rest 
peak attached facet pyramid its base its other vertex outside normal going through its centroid
if height peak sufficiently small then attaching peaks any subset facets will result convex polytope
will show later choose height so volume all peaks fraction volume
call family bodies remark our construction cross-polytopes peaks resemblance construction different parameters but there does not seem any connection between problem studied there problem interested  intuitively random point body family tells one if point one peaks then peak present otherwise one learns nothing
therefore if number queries at most polynomial  then one learns nothing about most peaks so algorithm cannot tell body got
but bodies do not large symmetric difference small fraction cross polytope if two bodies differ just one peak but pick subfamily them having pairwise symmetric difference at least picking large random subfamily
will do slightly differently will more convenient proof: bodies one-to-one correspondence binary strings length : each facet corresponds coordinate string takes value if facet peak attached else value
ensure any two bodies our family differ many peaks suffices ensure their corresponding strings large hamming distance
large sets strings course furnished good error correcting codes
family obtain another family almost disjoint bodies taking products while preserving property polynomially many random samples do not tell bodies apart
product trick also known tensoring been used many times before particular amplifying hardness but not aware its use setting similar ours
our construction product family also resembles operation concatenation coding theory
