 introduction 
quantum computation extremely exciting rapidly growing field
more recently increasing number researchers different backgrounds ranging physics computer sciences information theory mathematics philosophy involved researching properties quantum-based computation
during last decade series significant breakthroughs had been made
one was 1994 peter shor surprised world proposing polynomial-time quantum algorithm integer factorization  while classical world best-known classical factoring algorithm works superpolynomial time
three years later 1997 lov grover proved quantum computer could search unsorted database square root time
meanwhile gilles brassard et al combined ideas grover's shor's quantum algorithms propose quantum counting algorithm
recent years many interests focus quantum game theory considerable work been done
instance d meyer studied penny flip game quantum world firstly
his result showed if player was allowed implement quantum strategies he would always defeat his opponent who played classical strategies increase his expected payoff well j eisert et al  quantized prisoners' dilemma demonstrated dilemma could escaped when both players resort quantum strategies p
flitney et al  generalized eisert's result miracle move i e  result game would move towards quantum player's preferred result while other player used classical strategies l marinatto et al  investigated battle sexes game quantum domain
their result showed there existed unique equilibrium game when entangled strategies were allowed c f
lee et al  reported quantum game more efficient than classical game they found upper bound efficiency
besides some experiments about quantum games also been implemented different quantum computers
more details about quantum games see
successes achieved quantum algorithms make us guess powerful quantum computers figure out solutions faster better than best known classical counterparts certain types problems
furthermore more important they offer new way find potentially dramatic algorithmic speed-ups
therefore may ask naturally: construct quantum versions classical algorithms present new quantum algorithms solve problems pattern recognition faster better quantum computer
following idea some researchers proposed their novel methods demonstrated exciting results
addition data clustering main branch pattern recognition widely used many fields pattern analysis data mining information retrieval image segmentation
fields however there usually little priori knowledge available about data
response restrictions clustering methodology come into being particularly suitable exploration interrelationships among data points
data clustering formal study algorithms methods grouping classifying unlabeled data points
other words its task find inherent structure given collection unlabeled data points group them into meaningful clusters
paper attempt combine quantum game problem data clustering order establish novel clustering algorithm based quantum games
our algorithms unlabeled data points dataset regarded players who make decisions quantum games
time-varying network formed players each player permitted use quantum strategies plays entangled quantum game against every one his neighbors respectively
later he applies link-removing-and-rewiring lrr function remove links neighbors small payoffs create new links neighbors higher payoffs at same time
furthermore strength links between player his neighbors different one another updated grover iteration
during quantum games structure network strength links between players tend toward stability gradually
finally if each player only connects neighbor highest strength network will naturally divide into several separate parts each corresponds cluster
remainder paper organized follows: section 2 introduces some important concepts about quantum computation quantum prisoners' dilemma briefly
section 3 algorithms established two cases strategies payoff matrices link-removing-and-rewiring lrr functions then they elaborated analyzed
section 4 relationship between number nearest neighbors number clusters discussed
next effect cost sd-like payoff matrix analyzed relationship between total payoffs rates convergence algorithms explained
section 5 those datasets used simulations introduced briefly then results algorithms demonstrated
conclusion given section 6
