 introduction 
paper discuss classical problem: how approximate finite set relatively large finite subset regular low-dimensional object
application finite set dataset problem arises many areas: data visualization fluid dynamics
first hypothesis check is: whether dataset situated near low--dimensional affine manifold plane
if look point straight line plane


minimizes average squared distance datapoints immediately come principal component analysis pca
pca one most seminal inventions data analysis
now textbook material
nonlinear generalization pca great challenge many attempts been made answer
two them especially important our consideration: kohonen's self-organizing maps som principal manifolds
som algorithm take finite metric space metric try map into best preservation initial structure image b best approximation dataset
som algorithm several setup variables regulate compromise between goals
start some initial approximation map
each  th step algorithm datapoint current approximation
define ``owner" :
next approximation  } here step size monotonically decreasing cutting function
there many ways combine steps  whole algorithm
idea som very flexible seminal plenty applications generalizations but strictly speaking don't know what looking for: algorithm but no independent definition: som result algorithm work
attempts define som solution minimization problem some energy functional were not very successful
known probability distribution principal manifolds were introduced lines surfaces passing through ``the middle'' data distribution
intuitive vision was transformed into mathematical notion self-consistency : every point principal manifold conditional expectation all points projected into
neither manifold nor projection should linear: just differentiable projection data space usually domain  onto manifold self-consistency requirement conditional expectations: finite dataset  only one zero datapoints typically projected into point principal manifold
order avoid overfitting introduce smoothers become essential part principal manifold construction algorithms
soms give most popular approximations principal manifolds: take fragment regular dimensional grid consider resulting som approximation dimensional principal manifold see example 
several original algorithms construction principal curves surfaces finite datasets were developed during last decade well many applications idea
1996 discussion about som at 5th russian national seminar neuroinformatics method multidimensional data approximation based elastic energy minimization was proposed see bibliography there
method based analogy between principal manifold elastic membrane plate
