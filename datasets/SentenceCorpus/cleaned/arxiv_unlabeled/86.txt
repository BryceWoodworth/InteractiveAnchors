 
large number spectral variables most data sets encountered spectral chemometrics often renders prediction dependent variable uneasy
number variables hopefully reduced using either projection techniques selection methods; latter allow interpretation selected variables
since optimal approach testing all possible subsets variables prediction model intractable incremental selection approach using nonparametric statistics good option avoids computationally intensive use model itself
two drawbacks however: number groups variables test still huge colinearities make results unstable
overcome limitations paper presents method select groups spectral variables
consists forward-backward procedure applied coefficients b-spline representation spectra
criterion used forward-backward procedure mutual information allowing find nonlinear dependencies between variables contrary generally used correlation
spline representation used get interpretability results groups consecutive spectral variables will selected
experiments conducted nir spectra fescue grass diesel fuels show method provides clearly identified groups selected variables making interpretation easy while keeping low computational load
prediction performances obtained using selected coefficients higher than those obtained same method applied directly original variables similar those obtained using traditional models although using significantly less spectral variables
 introduction 
prediction problems often encountered analytical spectral chemometrics
they require estimating unknown value dependent variable example near-infrared spectrum
problems may encountered food  pharmaceutical textile industry cite only few
viewed statistical data analysis perspective main difficulty problem cope colinearity between spectral variables: not only consecutive variables spectrum highly correlated nature but addition real applications usually concern databases low number known spectra high number spectral variables
any method built original spectral variables thus ill-posed making feature spectral variable selection and/or projection necessary
selection projection methods differ several aspects
projection methods more general essence selection may regarded projection many zero weights
however projection methods usually build factors latent variables combinations large number original features
even if their prediction properties good they usually suffer fact latent variables hardly interpretable terms original features wavelengths case infrared spectra
contrary selection methods based principle choosing small number variables among original ones leading easy interpretation
course challenge selection methods obtain prediction performances same level projection ones
work interested variable selection methods providing interpretability
however if whole procedure consisting selecting features building prediction model them kept linear will certainly lead poorer performances than traditional widely used pls partial least squares latter consists projection prediction
thus investigated how nonlinear models may used both selecting features performing prediction
nonlinear models could used wrapper approach  their estimated generalization performances used relevance criterion group variables
however very demanding terms computational load because resampling techniques must used estimate accurately predicted error model addition fact one model must learned each considered feature set
paper thus focuses so-called filter approach: features selected prior use any prediction model
among filter methods correlation standard criterion used selecting features linear way: features maximal correlation dependent output variable possibly minimal information between them avoid redundancy selected
mutual information see eg  extends correlation measure nonlinear dependencies while correlation strictly limited linear ones
example correlation between centered antisymmetric variable its second power zero despite fact they obviously depend one another though nonlinear way
mutual information avoids drawback providing more general less restricted way measure dependencies between variables
mutual information mi already been used select variables near-infrared spectra
despite provides promising way extend state-of-the-art spectral analysis nonlinear methodologies direct selection variables mi suffers some drawbacks
first mi estimation becomes difficult number selected variables grows
indeed forward procedure estimation faced curse dimensionality making estimation mi last selected feature much more difficult than first selected one
second low number spectra usually available learning makes results selection highly dependent data set: small change data lead different selected variable sets resulting difficult interpretation
finally even though estimation mutual information less demanding terms computation time than construction nonlinear model large number initial variables results high computation times selection
paper propose first reduce number variables through projection spectral features before selection mutual information
maintain interpretability despite use projection latter achieved ensuring each coordinate projection corresponds restricted set initial features consecutive wavelengths
general methodology proposed followed: spectra projected functional basis
more precisely eg  projection basis b-splines chosen rather than wavelets example; indeed b-splines advantage they span restricted interval wavelengths intervals roughly same length over whole range
consequence each coefficient depends value corresponding spectrum limited wavelength interval
complete procedure then consists replacing spectra their b-spline coefficients selecting relevant coefficients measuring their mutual information output variable predicting latter using radial-basis function networks any other nonlinear model could used
all three steps nonlinear giving procedure necessary flexibility reach high performances both prediction interpretation
design parameters unavoidable nonlinear context number b-splines used projection set automatically without necessity user's choice using cross-validation method
paper shows prediction results obtained procedure comparable than those obtained through conventional linear techniques pls
addition interpretability added number wavelengths selected procedure remains low making possible identify wavelengths responsible phenomenon predict
moreover b-spline compression allows us both reduce feature selection running time increase quality prediction results compared same nonlinear procedure applied directly original spectral variables
section paper reminds how spectra projected basis b-splines details how number b-splines set automatically analyzes computational complexity procedure
section presents mutual information criterion its use forward-backward procedure
also investigates computational complexity forward-backward method
section shows examples application proposed method two data sets
first one consists nir spectra obtained fescue grass; aim predict nitrogen content plant
second one database spectra fuel samples goal predict cetane number fuel
