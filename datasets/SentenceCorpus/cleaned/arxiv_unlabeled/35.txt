here task construct hypothesis mixture gaussians statistically indistinguishable actual mixture generating data; specifically kl~divergence should at most
scenario give time algorithm learns class mixtures any constant number axis-aligned gaussians
our algorithm makes no assumptions about separation between means gaussians nor does any dependence minimum mixing weight
contrast learning results known ``clustering'' model where assumptions unavoidable
our algorithm relies method moments subalgorithm developed discrete mixture-learning problem
 introduction 
kearns et al \ introduced elegant natural model learning unknown probability distributions
framework given class probability distributions over access random data sampled unknown distribution belongs goal output hypothesis distribution high confidence close measured kullback-leibler kl divergence standard measure distance between probability distributions see section details distance measure
learning algorithm should run time
model well-motivated its close analogy valiant's classical probably approximately correct pac framework learning boolean functions
several notable results both positive negative been obtained learning kearns et al \ framework  see eg 
here briefly survey some positive results been obtained learning various types mixture distributions recall given distributions mixing weights sum 1 draw corresponding mixture distribution obtained first selecting probability then making draw  kearns et al \ gave efficient algorithm learning certain mixtures hamming balls ; product distributions over each coordinate mean either some fixed over all mixture components
subsequently freund mansour independently cryan et al  gave efficient algorithms learning mixture two arbitrary product distributions over
recently feldman et al  gave time algorithm learns mixture any many arbitrary product distributions over discrete domain any
