 introduction 
consider problem reconstructing low rank matrix small set observed entries possibly corrupted noise
problem considerable practical interest many applications
one example collaborative filtering where users submit rankings small subsets say movies goal infer preference unrated movies recommendation system
believed movie-rating matrix approximately low-rank since only few factors contribute user's preferences
other examples matrix completion include problem inferring 3-dimensional structure motion triangulation incomplete data distances between wireless sensors
