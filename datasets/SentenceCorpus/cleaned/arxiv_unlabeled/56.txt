 introduction 
successful telecommunication requires efficient resource allocation achieved developing adaptive control policies
reinforcement learning {rl} presents natural framework development policies trial error process interaction environment
work apply {rl} algorithm network routing
effective network routing means selecting optimal communication paths
modeled multi-agent {rl} problem
sense learning optimal control network routing could thought learning some traditional {rl} episodic task like maze searching pole balancing but repeating trials many times parallel interaction among trials
under interpretation individual router agent makes its routing decisions according individual policy
parameters policy adjusted according some measure global performance network while control determined local observations
nodes do not any information regarding topology network their position
initialization each node well learning algorithm follows identical every other node independent structure network
there no notion orientation space other semantics actions
our approach allows us update local policies while avoiding necessity centralized control global knowledge networks structure
only global information required learning algorithm network utility expressed reward signal distributed once epoch dependent average routing time
learning multi-agent system biologically plausible could thought neural network each neuron only performs simple computations based locally available quantities
