 introduction 
quasars  radio pulsars  cosmic gamma-ray bursts were all discovered alert scientists who while examining data primary purpose encountered aberrant phenomena whose further study led legendary discoveries
discoveries were possible era when scientists had close connection their data
advent massive data sets renders unexpected discoveries through manual inspection improbable if not impossible
fortunately automated anomaly detection programs may resurrect mode discovery identify atypical phenomena indicative novel astronomical objects *} our research applies anomaly detection photometric time series data called light-curve data
our specific application find anomalies sets light-curves periodic variable stars
most stars like our own sun almost constant luminosity whereas variable stars undergo significant variations
there over 350,000 cataloged variable stars more being discovered
2003 general catalogue variable stars lists known suspected variable stars our own galaxy well 10,000 other galaxies
periodic variable stars period star established
common types periodic variable stars include cepheid eclipsing binaries rr lyrae details found
study periodic variable stars great importance astronomy
example study cepheids yielded most valuable method determining hubble constant study binary stars enabled discovery star's true mass
finding new class subclass variable stars will tremendous value
figure shows typical light-curve each star class before after perform our pre-processing techniques described section 
y-axis measures magnitude brightness star
magnitude inversely proportional brightness observation thus y-axis plotted descending values
x-axis measures folded time
folded light-curve light-curve where all periods mapped onto single period why there may multiple points y-axis single time point
describe light-curves process folding more detail section } our research motivated challenges inherent performing anomaly detection large sets periodic variable light-curves
several challenges common many time series data sets
there large number time-points each light-curve high dimensionality low signal-to-noise ratio voluminous amounts data
indeed new surveys panoramic survey telescope rapid response system pan-starrs capacity produce light-curves billions stars
any technique developed light-curves must scale very large data sets
unique challenge working light-curve data periods light-curves not synchronized because each generated different source star
understand why phasing poses challenge anomaly detection domain consider figure  illustrates how two similar light-curves may appear dissimilar under similarity measure like euclidean distance if phase adjustment not performed
top panel shows two similar light-curves whose phases not synchronized
middle panel shows square correlation plotted function phase adjustment
maximum similarity occurs at phase shift approximately 0 3
bottom panel shows two light-curves after dotted light-curve shifted amount
define optimal phase shift between two light-curves shift yields maximum similarity value
phasing problem presents challenge both general anomaly detection techniques those developed specifically time series
general anomaly detection method even metric works unphased data may not work out box
regard time series anomaly detection techniques our task finding anomalies distinct time series differs most work assumes single contiguous time series not necessarily periodic anomalous sub-regions sought
pcad our solution problem anomaly detection large sets unsynchronized periodic time series
heart pcad modified k-means clustering algorithm called phased k-means pk-means runs sampling data
pk-means differs k-means re-phases each time series prior similarity calculation updates centroids rephased curves
because pk-means modification k-means provide proof pk-means does not break k-means's convergence properties
pk-means subroutine runs offline sampling data
use sampling enables pcad scale large data sets
online portion pcad calculation anomaly score each time series set centroids produced offline pk-means
operation linear size data set
another advantage pcad its flexibility discover two types anomalies: local global
define terms local global anomaly provide scoring methods both
once each time series assigned anomaly score pcad ranks time series accordingly outputs top review
our knowledge pcad only anomaly detection method developed specifically unsynchronized time series data output both global local outliers
our paper presents empirical evidence four data sets pcad effectively finds known anomalies produces better ranking anomalies when compared naive solutions other state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods time series
discuss effect sample size parameter used pk-means anomaly detection results show experimental results light-curve data unknown number anomalies
our paper concludes astrophysicists's discussion significance anomalies found pcad
