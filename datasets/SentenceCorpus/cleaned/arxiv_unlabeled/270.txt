 
work describes method approximating matrix permanents efficiently using belief propagation
formulate probability distribution whose partition function exactly permanent then use bethe free energy approximate partition function
after deriving some speedups standard belief propagation resulting algorithm requires time per iteration
finally demonstrate advantages using approximation
 introduction 
permanent scalar quantity computed matrix been active topic research well over century
plays role cryptography statistical physics where fundamental ising dimer models
while determinant matrix evaluated exactly sub-cubic time efficient methods computing permanent remained elusive
since permanent p-complete efficient exact evaluations cannot found general
best exact methods improve over brute force   include ryser's algorithm requires many arithmetic operations
recently promising fully-polynomial randomized approximate schemes fpras emerged provide arbitrarily close approximations
many methods build initial results broder who applied markov chain monte carlo popular tool machine learning statistics sampling perfect matchings approximate permanent
recently significant progress produced fpras handle arbitrary matrices non-negative entries
method uses markov chain monte carlo only requires polynomial order samples
however while methods tight theoretical guarantees they carry expensive constant factors not mention relatively high polynomial running times discourage their usage practical applications
particular experienced prominent algorithm slower than ryser's exact algorithm any feasible matrix size project only becomes faster around
remains seen if other approximate inference methods brought bear permanent
instance loopy belief propagation also recently gained prominence machine learning community
method exact singly-connected networks trees
certain special loopy graph cases including graphs single loop bipartite matching graphs bipartite multi-matching graphs  convergence bp been proven
more general loopy graphs loopy bp still maintains some surprising empirical success
theoretical understanding convergence loopy bp recently been improved noting certain general conditions its fixed points relating them minima bethe free energy
article proposes belief propagation computing permanent investigates some theoretical experimental properties
section  describe probability distribution parameterized matrix similar those described partition function exactly permanent
section  discuss bethe free energy introduce belief propagation method finding suitable set pseudo-marginals bethe approximation
section  report results experiments
then conclude brief discussion
