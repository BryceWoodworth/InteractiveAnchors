cannot predict exactly how complicated processes weather stock market social interactions so will develop into future
nevertheless people do make weather forecasts buy shares all time
predictions based formal models human expertise intuition
investment company may even want choose between portfolios basis combination kinds predictors
scenarios predictors typically cannot considered ``true''
thus may well end up position where whole collection prediction strategies experts  each whom some insight into some aspects process interest
address question how given set experts combined into single predictive strategy good if possible even better than best individual expert
setup follows
let finite set experts
each expert issues distribution next outcome given previous observations
here each outcome element some countable space  random variables written bold face
probability expert assigns sequence outcomes given chain rule:
standard bayesian approach combine expert predictions define prior experts induces joint distribution mass function
inference then based joint distribution
compute example: marginal probability data  b predictive distribution next outcome  defines prediction strategy combines those individual experts c posterior distribution experts  tells us how experts' predictions should weighted
simple probabilistic approach advantage computationally easy: predicting outcomes using experts requires only time
additionally bayesian strategy guarantees overall probability data only factor smaller than probability data according best available expert
flip side strategy never do any better than either:  means potentially valuable insights other experts not used our advantage
more sophisticated combinations prediction strategies found literature under various headings including bayesian statistics source coding universal prediction
latter experts' predictions not necessarily probabilistic scored using arbitrary loss function
paper consider only logarithmic loss although our results undoubtedly generalised framework described eg \
introduce hmms intuitive graphical language allows unified description existing new models
additionally running time evaluation models read off directly size their representation
