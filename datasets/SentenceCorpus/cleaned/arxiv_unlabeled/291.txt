article our concern not assess nor compare
appropriateness different models but focus computational
issue shared most them
indeed even if modeling

size data set
issue should put into perspective
new challenge inherent analysis network data

execution deal networks composed tens
thousands nodes if
not more

not handle networks more than few hundred  ;  few thousand  
heuristic-based algorithms may not satisfactory

but they concerned same limitations em
thus new

online algorithms constitute efficient alternative classical
