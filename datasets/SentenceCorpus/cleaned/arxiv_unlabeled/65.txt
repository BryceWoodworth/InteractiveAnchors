 introduction 
modeling relational information among objects pairwise relations represented graphs becoming important problem modern data analysis machine learning
many data sets contain interrelated observations
example scientific literature connects papers web connects pages links protein-protein interaction data connects proteins physical interaction records
settings often wish infer hidden attributes objects observed measurements pairwise properties
example might want compute clustering web-pages predict functions protein assess degree relevance scientific scholar's query
unlike traditional attribute data collected over individual objects relational data violate classical independence exchangeability assumptions typically made machine learning statistics
fact observations interdependent their very nature interdependence necessitates developing special-purpose statistical machinery analysis
there history research devoted end
one problem been heavily studied clustering objects uncover group structure based observed patterns interactions
standard model-based clustering methods eg  mixture models not immediately applicable relational data because they assume objects conditionally independent given their cluster assignments
latent stochastic blockmodel represents adaptation mixture modeling dyadic data
model each object belongs cluster relationships between objects governed corresponding pair clusters
via posterior inference model one identify latent roles objects possibly play govern their relationships each other
model originates stochastic blockmodel where roles objects known advance
recent extension model relaxed finite-cardinality assumption latent clusters via nonparametric hierarchical bayesian formalism based dirichlet process prior
latent stochastic blockmodel suffers limitation each object only belong one cluster other words play single latent role
real life not uncommon encounter more intriguing data entities multi-facet
example when protein social actor interacts different partners different functional social contexts may apply thus protein actor may acting according different latent roles they possible play
paper relax assumption single-latent-role actors develop mixed membership model relational data
mixed membership models latent dirichlet allocation  emerged recent years flexible modeling tool data where single cluster assumption violated heterogeneity within data point
they been successfully applied many domains document analysis  surveys  image processing  transcriptional regulation  population genetics
mixed membership model associates each unit observation multiple clusters rather than single cluster via membership probability-like vector
concurrent membership data different clusters capture its different aspects different underlying topics words constituting each document
mixed membership formalism particularly natural idea relational data where objects bear multiple latent roles cluster-memberships influence their relationships others
will demonstrate mixed membership approach relational data lets us describe interaction between objects playing multiple roles
example some protein's interactions may governed one function; other interactions may governed another function
existing mixed membership models not appropriate relational data because they assume data conditionally independent given their latent membership vectors
relational data where each object described its relationships others would like assume ensemble mixed membership vectors help govern relationships each object
conditional independence assumptions modern mixed membership models do not apply
paper develop mixed membership models relational data develop fast variational inference algorithm inference estimation demonstrate application our technique large scale protein interaction networks social networks
our model captures multiple roles objects exhibit interaction others relationships between those roles determining observed interaction matrix
