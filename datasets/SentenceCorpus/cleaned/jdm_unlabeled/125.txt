 
would you redirect trolley save five people even if means trolley will run over person side track
most people say they would
would you push same person into path trolley order save five
most people say they would not
sorts intuitive moral judgments made rapidly seem almost automatic
now imagine combined choice context where one redirect trolley push person its path do nothing
number lives lost intervening varied
most straightforward interpretations current theories moral judgment predict either no effect combined context will lead greater focus lives lost
contrast observe similarity effect utilitarian choice may become less attractive combined choice context
 introduction 
moral judgments often contrasted mundane secular decision making consumer choice
latter predominantly involves weighing costs benefits often may not preferred strategy moral situations
now classic trolley problem runaway trolley threatens run over kill five people trapped railroad track
if switch flipped trolley will move onto another track saving five but killing person trapped track
footbridge version only way save five push large person off bridge stop trolley
most people approve flipping switch but disapprove pushing person patterns so consistent some claimed they universal
reluctance push person often described example deontological decision making where focus intrinsic goodness badness actions per se rather than instrumental outcomes
asymmetry between switch pushing scenarios been used effective tool developing evaluating theories moral judgment
one popular distinction doctrine double effect differentiates between harm caused means harm caused side effect
harm means when actor uses body single victim prevent death larger number people considered impermissible
harm side effect however when trolley kills single victim after redirected sidetrack considered permissible
other relevant distinctions between direct indirect harm intervention victim versus intervention harmful object
number other studies varied plethora other factors associated action spatial distance physical contact between actor victim temporal order events sinnott-armstrong et al number further advancing our understanding role properties intervention moral choice
although most research trolley problems focused factors associated intervention others looked at role utility outcomes
example sacrificing stranger approved more than sacrificing relative but sacrificing obnoxious person nazi soldier approved more than sacrificing stranger
similarly lives in-group members valued more than lives out-group members
additional indicator sensitivity outcomes when number lives at stake increases approval intervention save lives increases too
finally trolley dilemmas been shown influenced framing experimental question
positive framing focusing attention number lives saved intervention leads greater approval action than negative framing focuses number lives lost result intervention
our study concerned context effects based combining two classic scenarios into one where actor throw switch redirect trolley push person off footbridge do nothing
standard case omission leads five deaths pushing causes one death vary number deaths associated redirecting trolley
current moral theories typically do not make explicit predictions about extended context comparisons though most straightforward interpretations suggest combined contexts increase attention outcomes
example mikhail proposed switch version two side-tracks one there person other empty
under condition redirecting trolley onto track single person becomes morally prohibited
our study however varied both action outcomes way no choice transparently dominated any other choice
specifically one our combined contexts actor could push large person off footbridge sacrificing one person save five throw switch redirect trolley away five but putting side track where two people will die do nothing case five people die
pushing person less desirable than throwing switch all else equal but killing two people less desirable than killing one
if combined choice context increases attention outcomes then mikhail's analysis action throwing switch should rated more negatively because there option available leading fewer deaths
same reason act pushing one person save five should if anything become relatively more desirable
alternatively action pushing may seen always wrong so disapproval pushing would not affected context
collected pilot data combined contexts appeared undermine seemingly straightforward predictions
particular presence switch option led less approval pushing person even when throwing switch led more deaths
led us consider different form choice context effect similarity effect
know no theory moral judgment predicts similarity effects
what follows first describe similarity effects closely related context effects then turn study aimed at examining choice context effects
toc paragraph choice context effects
 h number class paragraph sec anchor  choice context effects
h number sec end  challenges moral psychology faces when extrapolating results binary moral dilemmas broader contexts shows parallels development choice theory
suppose interested how much consumers like number prospective car models
one way ask them how much they willing pay given model
shortcoming method lacks reference point person compares item so many cases answers will not very informative
another way try capture consumer choices simply use binary comparisons where consumers choose more preferred car all possible pairwise comparisons
transform choices into some preference metric will tell us relative ranking each car compared rest
further since scale will assume transitivity even rely partial information where if do not data direct comparison between cars c still infer what people will choose based other comparisons two cars participated
early promising attempts model choice behavior were quickly undermined new findings wider range paradigms
depending particular configuration choice set addition new option been found systematically change preferences
several context effects been identified present purposes focus similarity compromise effects
addition consider context effect associated separate versus joint evaluation so-called evaluability hypothesis
toc paragraph similarity compromise evaluability
 h number class paragraph sec anchor  similarity compromise evaluability
h number sec end  imagine buyer choose between toyota prius ford focus all she cares about price fuel economy
toyota prius gets better gas mileage but ford focus compensates having lower price
further imagine our hypothetical scenario she finds herself roughly indifferent number  number between two options
early work rational choice theory recognized when additional options become available new options might well attract choices but theories did assume relative preference between initial set prius focus our example would remain same
many empirical studies however established people often violate independence principle
similarity effect adding non-dominated option close one alternatives tends increase relative share its competitor
example if add honda insight choice set slightly worse than prius fuel efficiency but slightly better price buyer who was previously indifferent about prius focus options typically shifts preferring focus over prius
informally could say insight steals more choices prius than focus
alternatively see figure number imagine adding honda civic choice set rather than honda insight assume civic more similar focus being slightly better gas mileage but slightly more expensive
now relative choice between prius focus should shift towards prius civic competes more focus than prius
refer choice context effects similarity effect
addition similarity effect two other types context effect potentially relevant current work
first compromise effect whereby introducing third option results one first two being seen compromise leads increase choices compromise option
continuing car example if add third option nissan leaf example much better gas mileage than prius but also significantly more expensive then prius will become compromise studies show being middle often increases consumer preferences
conversely adding cheaper less fuel efficient option prius versus focus choice set may make focus compromise lead being favored
how might compromise effects work our hypothetical scenario
let's begin our example throwing switch save five people but leading death two people versus doing nothing
adding option pushing one person save five could make throwing switch compromise between saving more versus fewer lives all else equal avoiding actions leading any deaths
leads counter-intuitive notion adding push option may make throwing switch more desirable
final context effect will mention stems work separate versus joint evaluation
imagine you assign value two dictionaries one very good condition containing number number words other fair condition but number number words
hsee found smaller dictionary priced higher than larger one when each evaluated isolation separate evaluation but smaller dictionary received lower pricing than larger one joint evaluation
according evaluability hypothesis number words not very meaningful piece information separate evaluation because there no reference point comparison
result number words becomes more important dimension joint rather than separate evaluation
same way our scenario where throwing switch leads two people dying but five being saved evaluability may shift direction outcome utility when option pushing single person save five added
would lead throwing switch option becoming less desirable
moral choices equally susceptible choice-set context effects
our initial hunch was instrumental choices would based evaluability
but also considered possibility options evoking deontological rules might not susceptible context effects
example option saving three lives might seen quite positive itself but lose its value when there option available would save four lives
but inappropriate immoral act like pushing person off bridge may remain immoral equally bad even when instrumentally less desirable options added
trolley footbridge problems conceptualized comprised choice set having two dimensions one representing value utility number people saved lost other representing value cost intrinsic actions themselves including inaction
latter dimension useful basic distinction difference between throwing switch acceptable versus pushing person unacceptable when instrumental outcomes same
addition baron his collaborators shown when harmful outcomes at stake people often choose do nothing showing omission bias
example one would expect given choice between doing nothing one person dies versus throwing switch one person dies people will show strong preference do nothing
combining observations dimension forms action leading harm context omission preferable throwing switch turn greatly preferable pushing person
dimension lives lost less better
two hypothetical dimensions set stage examining context effects
next section present empirical study compares preferences action omission five different choice sets
key comparison between two three-alternative choice-sets trilemmas same omission footbridge-intervention options but differ number victims switch intervention
if approvals two shared options pushing omission differ function properties third option will demonstrate context effect may take form similarity effect compromise effect evaluability effect
