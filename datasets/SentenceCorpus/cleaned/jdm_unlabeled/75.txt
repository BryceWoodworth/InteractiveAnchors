 introduction 
rozin argued recently some phenomena broad social significance they warrant whatever even imperfect light able shed them
discourse means jurors reach their verdict decisions arguably falls into category
jury deliberation component democratic legal system traditionally shrouded secrecy
even if were more available external observers complexity number individuals engaged largely unconstrained dialog about controversial often intricate matters so great challenge analysis process
unsurprisingly then bulk jury research been devoted examination influences jury outcomes rather than deliberation process itself
research does exist deliberation process typically concerned social influence processes little say about phenomenon key interest us here  reasoning means jurors influence one another
work reported here undertook gain insight into dialogic reasoning occurs during jury deliberation reducing its complexity looking at just microcosm albeit arguably authentic one larger process
jurors awaiting trial assignment were asked listen tape-recorded synopsis constructed transcript actual trial make verdict judgment
two jurors whose judgments differed were then asked deliberate they might jury room try reach agreement one another regarding proper verdict
present article examine some characteristics discourse including both characteristics general sample characteristics variation appeared across participants
individual juror's task two us argued earlier one theory-evidence coordination
juror needs construct multiple theories story-verdict constellations evaluated against presented evidence
theories compared verdict having most consistent least discrepant evidence associated selected
if characterization correct task requires representations evidence representations each theories verdict definitions set mental operations directed toward coordinating two
specific prediction test here therefore nature representations both will affect nature outcome jurors' deliberation
individual variation data consistent model
kuhn et al found individuals at more advanced epistemological levels who believe absolute certainty not possible who also tend more highly educated were more likely choose more moderate intermediate verdicts number degree murder manslaughter their individual verdict choices
performance was also related number argument skills  e g discounting counterargument justifying alternative verdict  require evidence-theory coordination
present article wished explore utility theory-evidence coordination model shedding light aspects subsequent phase jury decision-making process i e individual juror's reasoning judgment following presentation trial evidence engagement jurors discourse one another objective reaching joint decision
specifically pose two research questions
first if success excerpt discourse between two jurors defined one successfully persuading other evidence better fits one verdict than another successful productive discourse should contain frequent reference individual verdicts criteria define each well evidence against they must compared
does jurors' discourse fact characteristics
second wished better understand how individual differences juror reasoning identified earlier work likely manifest themselves juror discourse
education level been found strong predictor individual juror reasoning therefore could anticipated affect discourse between jurors well
however itself education level complex largely opaque variable
what likely make more educated individual more incisive reasoner juror context
here investigate level epistemological understanding likely candidate
research epistemological understanding identified three broad levels understanding absolutist absolute objective truth determined multiplist subjectivity interpretation judgment recognized given priority evaluativist subjectivity recognized but does not preclude evaluation judgment conflicting interpretations
latter levels become more prevalent increasing age more educated individuals tend fall more often into latter categories
different levels understanding regarding nature knowing certainty propose implicated education difference juror behavior similarly may implications ways jurors talk one another hence conduct their decision-making task
specifically predict absolutist conception knowledge certain objectively knowable works against execution theory evidence coordination entailed juror task
multiplist relativist conception knowledge entirely subjective more open examination multiple perspectives yet omits judgmental component characteristic evaluativist conception multiple perspectives compared evaluated framework argument evidence
