 introduction 
hammond argued there two main camps researchers field judgment decision making jdm who each adopted different criteria assessing competence human judgments decisions
according hammond researchers brunswikian tradition tend emphasize correspondence judgment ecological criteria while researchers heuristics biases h b program tend assess coherence
hammond's claim conclusions about competence judgments decisions will depend upon selection coherence correspondence criterion
hammond stated understanding important field human judgment cannot go forward cannot eliminate current disarray without our acknowledging role coherence correspondence
strong claim focus paper evaluation claim
first i provide overview brief history terms coherence correspondence c c philosophical theories truth they relate jdm
second i provide example hammond's claim examining some literature base rate neglect
third i examine hammond's claim applies broader field jdm
fourth i critique hammond's claim suggest refinements c c distinction needed
specifically i point out there two important types coherence third philosophical theory truth pragmatism needed complete framework
