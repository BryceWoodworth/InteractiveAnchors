 introduction 
distinction between maximizing satisficing approaches decision making long been considered important decision making literature
when maximizing decision makers hope find best possible solution systematically comparing available alternatives based well-defined preferences
when satisficing contrast decision makers aspire find solution meets important minimum requirements aspirations i e option good enough rather than best
schwartz et al attracted considerable attention interest when proposing individuals differ their global disposition maximize versus satisfice decision making
new maximizing scale was claimed adequately measure individual maximizing tendency was presented
based analysis correlates scale maximizers seemed less happy life less optimistic possess lower self-esteem
maximizers also appeared more prone depression perfectionism regret well more inclined engage upward social comparison than satisficers
accordingly schwartz argued maximizing represents recipe unhappiness due overly high expectations self-fulfilling fears regret
increased opportunities choice were also claimed represent particular burden maximizers who would feel compelled explore all possible opportunities find increasingly difficult make choice
line reasoning corresponds schwartz's previous research problems related increased choice possible tyranny freedom schwartz recommended decision makers should make efforts learn accept good enough rather than searching elusive best well stop worrying about what they missing
subsequent research replicated several key results schwartz et al 's studies identified other negative correlates
example findings parker bruine de bruin fischoff suggest maximizing associated worse life outcomes less behavioral coping greater dependence others more decision avoidance
parker et al argued if relationships causal then importance teach normative decision making skills well stress benefits satisficing order obtain better outcomes
inspired research opportunities associated schwartz et al 's maximizing scale well prospects offering practical advice decision makers scale was introduced several groups graduate students business administration norway
some groups responded original english version scale while other groups rated items pilot version norwegian based preliminary translations items
surprisingly hardly any subjects seemed maximizers based their scores original maximizing scale regardless whether scale was presented original english version pilot-version norwegian
all but very few subjects reported satisficing approaches most tasks depicted items scale
yet based discussions schwartz et al 's theoretical underpinnings many subjects reported they indeed considered themselves maximizers
however many items scale were seen too commonplace too inconsequential set off maximizing efforts
subjects also argued many items referred situations were irrelevant them
feedback indicated many items scale not sufficiently general terms item content simultaneously not sufficiently relevant measure differences individual maximizing tendency across samples settings cultures
limitations construct validity scale also been stressed diab gillespie highhouse among others
diab et al argued uni-dimensionality internal consistency important characteristics maximization attribute all thirteen items scale should load onto one factor
however schwartz et al 's scale comprises three distinct sub-dimensions several items produce relatively weak inconsistent factor loadings
accordingly there been debate literature concerning validity construct factor structure reliability scale well proposed correlates indicating maximizers less happy than satisficers
diab et al asserted findings indicating maximizers less happy than satisficers need interpreted light inadequate definition measurement core construct
based definition individual maximizing tendency general tendency pursue identification optimal alternative diab et al presented several alternative measures
hypothesized schwartz et al 's maximizing scale produced significantly higher correlations maladaptive personality traits dysfunctional decision making behaviors regret indecisiveness avoidance neuroticism life-satisfaction than several diab et al 's alternative measures including their nine-item scale
nenkov morrin ward schwartz hulland also addressed factor structure reliability validity schwartz et al 's maximizing scale several short forms scale were tested using datasets different populations
results replicated three-factor solution schwartz et al
nenkov et al interpreted first dimension reflect preference extensive alternative search i e desire continue seeking even better options
second dimension was interpreted reflect decision difficulty i e decision makers' perceived difficulty choosing making decisions
third dimension was taken represent decision makers' tendency hold high standards themselves their surroundings
nenkov et al argued along same lines diab et al stressing need uni-dimensionality internal consistency measurements maximizing construct
however although several short versions schwartz et al 's scale appeared equally useful when analyzing correlates three sub-dimensions varied their correlation other variables
nenkov et al therefore argued three dimensions should examined separately future research there need resolve whether all perhaps only one two three sub-dimensions represent inherent components maximizing construct
research reported diab et al nenkov et al suggests measurement individual maximizing tendency associated several fundamental methodological problems need resolved order advance research area
view interest schwartz et al 's seminal article relatively few studies report empirical findings based original scale refined versions scale so far
important exceptions include carrillat edmondson ladik's study customer loyalty iyengar wells schwartz's investigation job search strategies bruine de bruin parker fischoff's investigation individual differences decision making competence parker bruine de bruin fischoff's exploration decision making styles competence outcomes chowdhury ratneshwar mohanty's investigation maximizing versus satisficing consumers lewer gerlich gretz' analysis determinants maximizing consumer purchase
ambition studies reported here was threefold
first purpose derives lack success when introducing schwartz et al 's scale new population was contribute improving measurement scale testing original new items across several new large samples
second purpose was replicate extend previous studies correlates individual maximizing tendency
improved insight into correlates may shed better light maximizers' personality traits driving forces behind efforts maximize decision making
instrument development testing across subjects settings important practical well theoretical methodological reasons
reliable scale adequate factor structure discriminate validity would facilitate future research maximizing
efforts develop adequate scale may also improve our understanding core construct aid development clearer definition better nomological net
attention attracted schwartz et al 's research also demonstrates reliable scale high interest high potential value decision makers who wish reflect improve their decision making
