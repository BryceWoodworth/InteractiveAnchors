 
compare critique two measures risk perception
suggest single question  how risky situation
 captures concept risk perception more accurately than multiple-item measure used sitkin weingart
fact latter measure inadvertently captures notions attractiveness expected return rather than risk perception
further propose error underlying construction sitkin weingart's measure explained terms top-down model risk perception perceived risk perceived return consequences rather than determinants attractiveness
two studies compare validity two alternative measures
 introduction 
concepts risk return attractiveness distinct concepts theory decision making
therefore empirical measurement perceived risk should apply special care avoid its contamination perceived return global evaluation attractiveness guard against inadvertent replacing one kind meaning another
demonstrate ease three concepts confused understand reasons confusion examine measure risk perception was developed sitkin weingart critique its validity measure concept risk perception
explain erroneous construction measure within framework top-down model risk perception suggest error constructing measure reflects inadvertent replacement top-down bottom-up perception relationships between perceived risk perceived return attractiveness
empirical data provide support suggestions
