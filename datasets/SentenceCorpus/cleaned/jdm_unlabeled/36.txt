 
previous research identified important determinants overall evaluations experiences lived across time
means novel guessing task i study what decision-makers themselves consider important
informants some participants live evaluate experience
guessers others infer its overall evaluation asking informants questions
i rewarded accurate inferences analyzed classified questions four experiments involving auditory gustatory viewing experiences
results show guessers thought overall evaluations reflecting average momentary impressions
moreover alternatively they tended consider personality attitudes experiencing person experience-specific holistic judgments behavioral intentions regarding experience
thus according lay intuitions overall evaluations more than reflection experience's momentary impressions
 introduction 
people often report experiences expressing number scale
someone might say number out number concert terms painfulness i rate medical procedure number out number
overall evaluations experiences been shown important decision inputs studied extensively
kahneman wakker sarin suggested experiences represented intensity profiles pleasure discomfort over bounded intervals time i e time profiles experienced utility
experiments field studies shown people evaluate more positively experiences increasing rather than decreasing time profiles at equivalent levels total pleasure experienced
there preference steeper rates improvement well variability experience
finally peak-end rule finding suggests overall evaluations best predicted only two moments experience most pleasant unpleasant final
kahneman wakker sarin present set assumptions about experiences explaining why integration summation all moments would correct normative point view
life satisfaction researchers psychologists other hand explore alternative paradigms study role personality beliefs evaluating person overall evaluations
contrast previous research present work aims reveal what decision makers themselves draw they think about overall evaluations experiences
i will compare lay intuitions what researchers considered
comparison may further enrich theories overall evaluations suggest ways testing them
i employ novel method guessing task order elicit lay intuitions
philosophy method active information search method naturalistic decision-making huber wider huber proposed study risky choice
method consists giving participants minimal description decision problem allowing them seek information
i report experiments participants had guess overall evaluation experience lived another person
active information search was allowed prior making guess
information participants sought was taken reveal lay intuitions about target overall evaluation
