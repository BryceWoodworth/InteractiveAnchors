 
people prefer their own initials other letters influencing preferences many domains
name letter effect may not apply negatively valenced targets if people motivated downplay distance themselves negative targets associated self previous research shown
current research examine relationship between same initial preferences negatively valenced stimuli
specifically examined donations disaster relief after seven major hurricanes test influence name letter effect negatively valenced targets
individuals who shared initial hurricane name were overrepresented among hurricane relief donors relative baseline distribution initials donor population
finding suggests people may seek ameliorate negative effects disaster when there shared characteristics between disaster self
 introduction 
katrina petrillo raised number hurricane katrina victims selling lemonade
when asked why she said i realized my name going go down history one biggest storms ever
current research explores whether katrina petrillo's response association between hurricane katrina her name might more likely than what would expected chance
specifically predict donors who share initial disaster will more likely donate disaster relief efforts particular disaster than would individuals who do not share initial disaster
prediction individuals who share initial disaster will more likely donate fundraising efforts targeted at disaster consistent research demonstrated people prefer initial their first name over other letters
preference called name letter effect reflected both subjective ratings initials choices same-initial targets over comparable targets different initials
shared initials been shown influence choices numerous domains including product preferences donations political candidates spouses occupations
example one study found people names beginning letter d overrepresented profession dentists people names beginning letter l overrepresented population lawyers
similarly people named george more likely live georgia than expected chance people named louise more likely live louisiana
together findings indicate similarities affect judgment choice presumably creating unit-relation facilitates assimilation positive feelings self into representation target
psychologists theoretically assumed people should avoid associations negative stimuli
claim based several studies shown people cut off reflected failure close others order protect ego
example people less likely wear clothing displaying logos sports teams recently lost game compared teams recently won game
similarly snyder colleagues randomly assigned groups college students receive positive negative false feedback group task
they found compared no-feedback control successful group demonstrated more affiliative tendencies while failure group demonstrated less afilliative tendencies
under other circumstances individuals may downplay negative features target they share unit relationship
finch cialdini found subjects who believed they shared birthday rasputin rated him less negatively after reading description his misdeeds than those who did not
recent study nelson simmons extended work demonstrating pairing initial negative outcome undermines task performance
specifically they found people whose first names begin c d initials lower gpas than people other initials baseball players k initials letter used represent strikes baseball more likely strike out than players other initials presumably because people tend downplay severity negative outcome much they downplay rasputin's deeds when they think he shares their birthday
other words people first names begin c d may implicitly downplay severity getting lower grades consequently dampen efforts perform well
extending research implicit egotism negative stimuli contend people may not always minimize their associations negative stimuli downplay their negativity
clearly katrina petrillo understood negative impact hurricane katrina
she claimed sharing her name severe storm motivated her help its victims
if she minimized her association storm unlikely she would attend common initial consequently would feel no more motivated donate money than anyone else
similarly if she downplayed severity storm unlikely she would mention worst storm history invest so much time raising money
case again unlikely she would so compelled donate given previous research suggesting people less likely donate less severe disasters
katrina petrillo's efforts raise money victims hurricane katrina contrary both processes outline above well self-enhancement literature general
however there circumstances when people may not avoid their association negative targets may even make reparations actions others whom they share association
example people will endorse compensatory behavior right wrongs committed their ingroup against outgroup even if compensatory behavior comes at personal cost self
doosje colleagues found phenomena was mediated feelings collective guilt suggesting responsibility like positive affect transfer between members unit-relation
if group membership increases likelihood compensatory behavior actions other group members then perhaps other kinds unit-relations do same
taken together previous literatures self-target associations allow us speculate katrina petrillo's sentiment towards victims hurricane katrina may shared others
shared-initials capable producing unit relation there at least some evidence unit-relation target inflicts harm lead people help their victims
led us expect people would i more likely donate money same-initial disasters possibly ii donate more money same initial disasters
