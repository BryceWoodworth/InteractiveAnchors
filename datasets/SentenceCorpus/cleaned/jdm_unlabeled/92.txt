 
inferences about target variables achieved deliberate integration probabilistic cues retrieving similar cue-patterns exemplars memory
tasks cue information presented on-screen displays rule-based strategies tend dominate unless abstraction cue-target relations unfeasible
dominance also been demonstrated  surprisingly  experiments demanded retrieval cue values memory
three modified replications involving fictitious disease binary cue values were represented either alternative symptoms e g fever vs hypothermia symptom presence vs absence e g fever vs no fever
former representation might hinder cue abstraction
cues were predictive severity disease participants had infer each trial who two patients was sicker
both experiments replicated rule-dominance present-absent cues but yielded higher percentages exemplar-based strategies alternative cues
experiments demonstrate change cue representation may induce dramatic shift rule-based exemplar-based reasoning formally identical tasks
 introduction 
making choices between objects people express either preferences bike do i like more
inferences share will fare better

often multiple pieces information about attributes probabilistic cues combined
traditionally decision researchers formulate decision strategies processing steps somehow integrate cues either weighted additive fashion according noncompensatory rules like lexicographic orderings
numerous strategies been proposed participants appear choose between them adaptively
juslin olsson olsson emphasized structural similarity choice categorization tasks both involve integration features cues
however categorization exemplar-based models assuming storage retrieval feature patterns basis inference rather than piecemeal cue integration cue abstraction models cam proven successful
juslin his colleagues explored applicability exemplar models multiple cue judgment tasks found successes well failures
persson rieskamp extended juslin's approach memory-based decisions cue values had retrieved memory rather than being presented experimenter i e during judgmental phase experiments participants received only stimulus names all their respective attributes  had been learned beforehand  had retrieved long term memory
their surprise p r did not find more exemplar-based decision making rather most participants adopted cam
will test conjecture retrieval memory per se does not induce exemplar-based decisions whereas difficulty cue abstraction combination memory retrieval does
