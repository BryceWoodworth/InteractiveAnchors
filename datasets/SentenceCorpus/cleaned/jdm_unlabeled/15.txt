 
assumption people possess repertoire strategies solve inference problems they face been made repeatedly
experimental findings two previous studies strategy selection reexamined learning perspective argues people learn select strategies making probabilistic inferences
learning process modeled strategy selection learning ssl theory assumes people develop subjective expectancies strategies they
they select strategies proportional their expectancies updated basis experience
study newell weston shanks shown people did not anticipate success strategy beginning experiment
instead behavior observed at end experiment was result learning process described ssl theory
second study broder schiffer ssl theory able provide explanation why participants only slowly adapted new environments dynamic inference situation
reanalysis previous studies illustrates importance learning probabilistic inferences
 introduction 
how do people make probabilistic inferences inferring selling price car severity illness likely winner tennis match
different strategies applied make inferences integrating all available information predict criterion
fact many researchers argued people equipped repertoire different cognitive strategies making judgments decisions
do people apply different strategies solving probabilistic inferences
if so how do they select their strategy repertoire
cost-benefit approach strategy selection argues people trade off strategies' anticipated costs benefits
contrast i will argue selection achieved via learning-that people learn success failure strategies through experience select strategy based past success
i will describe computational theory specifies learning process will use explain people's probabilistic inferences two previous studies
