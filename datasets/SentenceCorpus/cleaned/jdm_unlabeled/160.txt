 
using college student samples two studies were conducted validate chinese version domain-specific risk-taking dospert scale
results replicated important findings reported weber et al chinese culture
risk-taking risk perception were domain-specific whereas perceived-risk attitudes were relatively stable across domains supporting risk-return model risk taking
results both exploratory factor analysis efa confirmatory factor analysis cfa showed ethical recreational health safety gambling domains were preserved chinese version dospert items social investment domains formed one factor
result may explained weber hsee's cushion hypothesis
other possible reasons cross-cultural difference factor structure were also discussed
 introduction 
significant past research been conducted understand people's differences their risk-taking behaviors often referred differences risk attitude
according expected utility theory prospect theory risk attitude explained shape utility function
model risk attitude-an individual's location continuum risk aversion risk seeking-is assumed personality trait
based single trait view risk attitude researchers employed various methods measure
some studies require participants choose between lotteries then compare participants' observed choices choices predicted expected value
using probability equivalence method kogan wallach developed choice dilemma questionnaire asking respondents probability equivalents twelve choice dilemmas combined into single score represents risk attitude
nonetheless according blais weber studies were questionable due two major problems
firstly people may classified risk seeking risk averse depending method employed measure risk attitude
secondly even same method may categorize individual into different groups across different situations domains
problems suggest those measurements do not possess satisfactory predictive validity across range situations
given obvious deficiency many risk attitude measurements recently some researchers claimed risk attitude should conceptualized risk-return framework risky choice treated domain-specific manner
risk-return models assume risk taking reflect tradeoff between perceived risk fear expected return hope risk taking preference x expected benefit x b perceived risk x c where represents marginal effect expected benefit x risk taking preference b represents marginal effect perceived risk x risk taking preference c error term
researchers found systematic situational group differences perceived risk expected benefit risky behaviors
nevertheless people's perceived-risk attitude coefficient b-remains relatively stable across situations groups
therefore differences perceived risk expected return risky choices seem play major part observed domain-specificity risk attitude
risk return framework weber et al developed domain-specific risk-taking dospert scale order assess both conventional risk attitudes apparent risk taking i e risk taking preference formula above perceived-risk attitudes six domains namely social recreational gambling investment health safety ethical decisions
conventional risk attitudes defined people's stated level risk taking perceived-risk attitude defined willingness engage risky behavior function its perceived risk
therefore dospert scale measures both individuals' propensity engage risk activities their perceived risk expected return activities making possible study relationship between apparent risk taking risk perception thus perceived-risk attitude
using scale weber et al demonstrated participants' degree risk taking differed across domains differences were primarily associated differences perceived risk expected return risky behaviors rather than differences perceived-risk attitude
results provided strong support risk-return model risky choice
researchers provided strong evidence dospert scale's reliability validity
weber et al reported its initial psychometric properties including moderate reliability estimates satisfactory construct validity convergent discriminant validity respect constructs sensation seeking intolerance ambiguity social desirability
geographically dospert been validated many other cultures german dutch italian spanish
nonetheless date scale not been tested eastern cultures
mentioned above items six content domains dospert were originally developed validated u s since substantial cultural differences exist between western societies eastern societies there need examine its psychometric properties eastern culture
therefore order further examine cross-cultural validity dospert current paper validated scale chinese culture using university students china
process looked similarities differences risk taking function culture then discuss possible explanations observed differences
specifically conducted two studies address issues
simplicity sake will refer our translated revised version scale dospert-c
study number attempted identify factor structure dospert-c using exploratory factor-analytic procedure
moreover examined reliability dospert-c
also performed regression examine relationship between risk perception risk behavior
mentioned above risk-return framework assumes involvement various determinants namely perceived risk expected benefit perceived-risk attitude
however because logistical constraints expected benefit could not collected present study
thus study's emphasis conventional risk attitudes perception risk perceived-risk attitude
study number order provide further empirical support factor structure dospert-c conducted confimatory factor analysis
