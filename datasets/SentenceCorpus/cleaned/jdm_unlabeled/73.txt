however recent research suggests immune neglect-the tendency overlook coping strategies reduce future distress-may lead affective forecasting problems
prior evidence immune neglect been indirect
more direct evidence deeper understanding immune neglect vital informing design future decision-support interventions
current study young adults n number supplied predicted actual recollected reactions emotionally-evocative interpersonal event valentine's day
based participants' qualitative descriptions holiday team raters reliably coded effectiveness their coping strategies
supporting immune neglect hypothesis participants overlooked powerful role coping strategies when predicting their emotional reactions
immune neglect was present not only those experiencing holiday negatively non-daters but also those experiencing positively daters suggesting bias may more robust than originally theorized
immune neglect was greater immediate emotional reactions than more enduring reactions
further immune neglect was conspicuously absent recollected emotional reactions
implications decision-support interventions discussed
 introduction 
biases emotional judgment disrupt decision making
affective forecasting particular type emotional judgment involves predicting how future events will affect one's emotional state
affective forecasting significantly influence range important life choices including decisions seek diagnostic medical testing exercise get divorced file personal bankruptcy
effort elucidate potential biases affective forecasting recent studies examined how well predicted emotional reactions correspond actual emotional reactions life events
research shows affective forecasting prone error people often biased toward overpredicting intensity duration emotional reactions future events
key reason biased affective forecasting may people overlook coping strategies attenuate emotional reactions events
phenomenon been labeled immune neglect-the tendency overlook coping strategies other aspects psychological immune system reduce future distress
three studies provided indirect evidence immune neglect but none studies directly assessed coping strategies used participants course managing distressing events
initial study showed people overlook subtle aspects situation-particularly its potential influence coping-when making affective forecasts
study participants predicted how they would feel event they received negative personality feedback either expert psychologists purportedly infallible source computer purportedly fallible source
source personality feedback did not influence predicted emotional reactions but powerfully influenced actual emotional reactions experienced response personality feedback
study provided preliminary support possibility when engaging affective forecasting people might overlook coping strategies being able rationalize information fallible source
follow-up study examined affective forecasting college football team losses
study dispositional coping styles were found significantly correlated actual emotional reactions football losses but were unrelated predicted reactions situation-specific coping strategies were not assessed
finally third study examined affective forecasting election loss favored presidential candidate
cognitive processes working memory were associated better emotional functioning after loss but had no bearing predicted reactions
studies situational factors dispositional coping styles cognitive processes were unrelated predicted emotional reactions however they were related actual emotional reactions presumably through implied-but-unmeasured influence situation-specific coping strategies buffered emotional reactions distressing life events see figure number
time ripe basic research directly testing immune neglect hypothesis
recent reform initiatives national institutes health institute medicine called expanded emphasis emotional processes underlying decision making
further immune neglect recently been theorized reduce engagement proactive health behaviors lead consumers make faulty personal financial decisions
research decision-support interventions already targeting immune neglect effort facilitate decision-making processes
arguably decision-support interventions most likely effective when they informed foundation sound empirical evidence
direct evidence deeper understanding immune neglect essential development future evidence-based interventions will use findings affective forecasting improve decision making
past studies documented situational influences dispositional coping styles cognitive processes associated actual emotional reactions life events but not predicted emotional reactions-leading biased forecasts
three factors thought influence actual emotional reactions through their effect situation-specific coping strategies
no study date assessed situation-specific coping strategies presumed proximal mechanism underling forecasting problems despite implications decision making public health
therefore goals present investigation were examine immune neglect more directly b increase our overall understanding immune neglect identifying key moderators
order examine immune neglect directly present study used quantitatively-coded qualitative data coping strategies used participants day stressful life event
coping strategies assessed reliably using qualitative data
furthermore situation-specific coping strategies may more robust than indirect dispositional measures coping predicting emotional response discrete life events suggesting past studies may actually underestimate immune neglect
central hypothesis study was coping strategies would associated actual emotional reactions stressful life event but not predicted reactions thereby demonstrating immune neglect source bias affective forecasting
study was also designed identify moderators immune neglect expand our understanding phenomenon
foremost valence event-whether event pleasant unpleasant-may influence immune neglect
been suggested immune neglect may only apply affective forecasting unpleasant events pleasant events presumably do not trigger need coping strategies
however research ambivalence indicates many so-called pleasant events e g pregnancies promotions major purchases actually marked mixed feelings including distress could trigger use coping strategies
thus role immune neglect pleasant life events warrants further consideration
second immune neglect may vary across time course emotional reactions
emotional reactions response life events attenuate over time empirical evidence mixed whether affective forecasting more difficult immediate more enduring emotional reactions events
thus present study examined whether participants were more likely overlook immediate more enduring effects coping strategies upon their emotions
finally immune neglect could dissipate experience
several studies examined predicted actual recollected emotional reactions life events determine whether people learn experience make emotional judgments more accurately see hoerger chapman epstein duberstein press
findings been mixed whether predicted recollected reactions similarly problematic recollected reactions less vulnerable bias
thus present study examined immune neglect both predicted recollected reactions
identifying moderators immune neglect research determine situations where immune neglect most relevant potentially inform future interventions improving affective forecasting skills
current investigation builds prior work my colleagues i examining affective forecasting valentine's day number number hoerger quirk chapman duberstein press
studies those other labs demonstrate young adults vulnerable overpredicting intensity emotional reactions events involving relationships dating breakups
example young adults overestimate how happy they will feel event having date valentine's day overestimate how unhappy they will feel if they do not date
current investigation involves primary analyses existing qualitative data relevant coping was gathered during second studies hoerger quirk et al press
present research distinct prior report addressing fundamentally different constructs accounting variation actual recollected reactions rather than predicted reactions associated forecasting error coding hundreds archived qualitative responses
was hypothesized coping strategies coded quantitatively qualitative data collected valentine's day would associated actual emotional reactions but not predicted reactions demonstrating immune neglect source affective forecasting problems
supplemental analyses also examined whether immune neglect varied function valence event pleasant event those date unpleasant those without date timing valentine's day day after two days after type emotional judgment predicted ratings versus recollected ratings emotional reactions valentine's day
