 introduction 
assumption narrow self-interest central rational choice theory
postulate decision makers dms concerned about maximizing their own material gain indifferent payoffs other dms around them
simplifying assumption yields powerful framework predict explain human decision making behavior across wide variety domains
however there reliable counterexamples demonstrating dms' elicited preferences choices often influenced part payoffs other dms thus challenging what some termed selfishness axiom
studies motivations underlie interdependent decision behavior long history motivations been referred variety names including social preferences social motives other-regarding preferences welfare tradeoff ratios social value orientation svo

within svo framework assumed people vary their motivations goals when evaluating different resource allocations between themselves another person
examples dm may endeavor maximize her own payoff individualistic maximize competitive minimize inequality averse difference between her own other person's payoff maximize joint payoffs prosocial
worth noting however assumption narrow self-interest itself particular svo namely perfectly individualistic orientation
moreover considering spectrum different svos not challenge rational choice theory per se but rather extension postulate effort increase theory's psychological realism descriptive accuracy
svo been found affect cognitions account behavior across range interpersonal decision making contexts specifically domain negotiation settings resource dilemmas
svo also been identified covariate interacting different emotional states influencing propensity cooperate
svos even been identified non-human primates indicating some other species also show intrinsic preferences prosocial behavior
order use full explanatory power svo psychological construct need measure efficiently reliably validly
several different measurement methods quantifying variations svo across individuals been developed
although use existent measures produced wealth findings even categorical approaches measures substantial limitations
instance some measures yield only low-resolution output lack sensitivity important individual differences providing at best nominal categorization
other measures highly inefficient often fail produce consistent results substantial proportion subjects
yet other methods require substantial time effort research subject order produce score
moreover none existent measures explicitly designed detect more nuanced motivations like inequality aversion
specifically previous measures not disentangled orientation joint gain maximization motivation minimize difference between outcomes
although two orientations related they both indicate deviation individualism towards prosociality they substantially different motivations should differentiated both theoretically operationally
furthermore social value orientation continuous construct corresponds quantity how much dm willing sacrifice order make another dm better off perhaps worse off
quantification interdependent utilities best represented continuous scale
moreover since most commonly used svo measures date produce only categorical data substantial amount information related peoples' social preferences being discarded ignored
consequently full explanatory power svo not been used because unnecessary sacrifice statistical power see cohen number discussion unfortunate practice reducing continuous variables categories
our view method assessing svo should yield high resolution output makes sensitive inter intra-individual differences facilitate comparisons thereof easy use efficient able detect most prevalent svo individual differences allow evaluation rank orders social preferences yield meaningful results virtually all subjects
amongst criteria consider demand high resolution measure produces data continuous scale crucial
introduce here new measure svo takes conceptualization into account allows greater explanatory potential svo through increased statistical power while also meeting aforementioned psychometric criteria
new method referred svo slider measure
