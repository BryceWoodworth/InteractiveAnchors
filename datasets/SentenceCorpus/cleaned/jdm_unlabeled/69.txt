previous research suggests depressed individuals may make decisions differ those made non-depressed they use sub-optimal decision-making strategies
study constructed instrument aims measure variety decision-making styles well respondent's view him herself decision-maker decisional self-esteem
styles estimates decisional self-esteem were then related depressive symptoms
depressive symptomatology correlated negatively perception self decision-maker
those higher depression severity scores characterized themselves being more anxious about decisions more likely procrastinate
they also reported using fewer productive decision-making strategies depending more other people help decisions relying less their own intuitions when making decisions
further research needed determine extent decision-making styles antecedents depressive symptomatology instead products aspects phenomenology associated depression
 introduction 
decision-making styles theorized stable trait-like patterns approach situations call decision
like personality traits styles do not perfect predictive power but instead represent likelihoods behavior across situations domains
person scoring high particular decision-making style spontaneity when needing make decision expected act spontaneous manner more often than thoughtful deliberate one
number styles decision-making subject debate
instance scott bruce suggested there five decision styles whereas harren nygren identified three decision styles
decision styles were found associated variety behaviors attitudes including life choices career health-related decisions consumer behavior evaluations new technology cultural backgrounds
affect stress other non-rational internal events capable influencing people's decisions
sadness  emotion most closely associated depression  been shown influence decisions made both experimental tasks well real-life decisions
individuals suffering variety psychopathological conditions influence degree quality affect stress anxiety therefore likely engage decision-making differs better-adjusted individuals may result less productive decisions
thus individuals disorders depression may particular pattern decision styles
conflict theory decision-making attempts characterize decision-maker regard confidence decision b coping strategies used handle internal conflict decision arrive at most adaptive solution
individual's most prominent decision-making style one reflects default coping strategy employed when making important decisions
questionnaire assess both confidence decision-maker well coping strategies been developed assessing three styles decision-making defensive avoidance hypervigilance vigilance well individuals' confidence decision-maker
strong emotion psychopathology may affect decision process either through its effect decisional self-esteem increasing likelihood suboptimal decision coping style defensive avoidance hypervigilance will employed rather than more adaptive decision-making style namely vigilance
indeed avoidant decision style was found associated greater perceived stress
radford nakane ohta mann kalucy used mann questionnaire cross-cultural study comparing decision styles japanese australian depressed subjects controls
australian depressed subjects exhibited lower self-esteem decision makers compared australian controls whereas japanese subjects there was no difference
echoing findings their previous work examining decision-making inpatients psychiatric disturbances australian depressed subjects found decision-making very stressful were more likely than non-depressed use maladaptive decision styles interestingly few differences were found between depressed nondepressed japanese subjects
results found australian sample were also found sample african-american adolescents low-income families
radford et al study depressive symptoms correlated poor self-esteem decision-maker careless decision style avoidance decisions
many important decisions will affect later adult life willingness persevere school interest potential occupations choice peers made during adolescent years
association maladaptive decision styles adolescent dysphoria highlights need earlier identification potential problem would then allow earlier targeted interventions
other evidence suggesting depressed individuals may distinct pattern decision-making comes research areas related decision-making
indecisiveness been noted one core symptoms depression according dsm-iv-tr
decisional avoidance tendency avoid making choice postponing seeking easy way out involves no action change may especially problematic depressed individuals
pietromonaco rook compared decision styles dysphoric college students those controls asking them make decisions about real-life situations possible risk possible benefit
dysphoric students considered risks more likely more important more damaging all types situations
social situations dysphorics also under-rated benefits compared non-dysphorics were more reluctant proceed decision consistent findings affective component decision-making may produce inverse correlation between perceived risks benefits
pietromonaco rook results suggest dysphoric individuals may more avoidant decisions might due increased perception risk makes them more cautious
depressed individuals may therefore exhibit greater indecisiveness greater avoidance decisions well greater avoidance risk
perfectionist tendencies insofar they contribute feelings disillusionment dissatisfaction oneself world been shown associated depression
schwartz et al found individuals who tend pursue best possible option rather than good enough option more likely depressive symptoms
whereas satisficers likely happy option just satisfies their needs maximizers considerably less likely fully satisfied their choices because perfect option usually rather elusive goal
maximizers also more prone experience regret further contributes dysphoria
regret also been found associated depressive symptoms
therefore likely decision-making styles based perfectionism tendency towards regret would associated depressive symptoms
interestingly recent study found maximizers may somewhat distinct decision style profile specifically greater spontaneity their decisions
several questionnaires assessing decision styles been developed each targets relatively small set decision styles
questionnaires also show considerable overlap some subscales
instance analytical subscale nygren instrument similar rational subscale scott bruce questionnaire similar mann vigilance subscale
similarly defensive avoidance subscale features similar both avoidant dependant subscales scott bruce questionnaire
each instruments also subscales unique
however administering more than one questionnaire study participants would impractical given aforementioned overlap
furthermore current instruments do not address some styles decision-making likely especially relevant depressed individuals
discussed above risk-avoidance perfectionism being prone regret not been included decision style inventories
study aimed accomplish two goals
study number more comprehensive questionnaire than ones currently available assessment decision-making styles was created
new instrument sampled broad set decision-making styles constructs related decision-making
study number resulting instrument was used identify patterns decision-making common depression relating decision-making styles assessment depressive symptoms
