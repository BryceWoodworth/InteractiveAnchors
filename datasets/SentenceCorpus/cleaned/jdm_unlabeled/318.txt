 introduction 
null hypothesis significance testing nhst summarize data test statistic determine probability p obtaining test statistic at least extreme one observed if null hypothesis h true
low p-value taken indicate null hypothesis unlikely true either h false very improbable event occurred
nhst many detractors various approaches inference been offered alternatives including increased focus effect sizes confidence intervals greater emphasis replicability
perhaps most comprehensive radical alternative nhst adoption bayesian approach hypothesis testing number researchers recently argued more widespread adoption approach
while many judgment decision making jdm researchers will familiar bayesian techniques model fitting parameter estimation hypothesis testing overwhelmingly conducted nhst framework
article begins introducing bayesian hypothesis testing applying existing work judgment decision making
