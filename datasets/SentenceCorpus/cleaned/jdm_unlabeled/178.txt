developed scale measuring personal tendency passive risk taking prt validated using number undergraduate student sample obtained three factors indicating separate domains passive risk taking risk involving resources medical risks ethical risks
scale criterion validity correlated reported passive risk taking everyday life also high test-retest reliability
while correlated dospert scale prt shows divergent validity classic risk taking constructs like sensation seeking convergent validity tendencies previously not linked risk taking procrastination avoidance
results indicate passive risk separate unique domain risk taking merits further research understand cognitive motivational mechanism perpetuating
 introduction 
simple term risk taking suggests action involved when accepting risk
reseach risk taking behavior focuses mainly issues like drug alcohol abuse promiscuous sexual activity smoking reckless driving gambling participating dangerous sports taking part crime
but many real life situations risk also embodied abstaining taking action rather than taking
consider following examples only number percent us adults age number older underwent colon cancer screening within previous number years used relevant home test kit within preceding year-which partly why less than number percent colorectal cancers detected early
us states where drivers cannot pulled over police solely not using seatbelt number percent chose not wear one
only number number percent americans age number  number working full time participate some kind retirement plan
people who don't undergo recommended cancer screenings don't wear seatbelts don't save retirement all taking risks due their inactions
risk taking literature so far focused predominantly actions people take put them at risk less attention been paid those risks brought greatly magnified inaction
even though grave passive risk choices like not getting cancer screenings not saving retirement been at focus academic research they not been regarded risk taking not been analyzed under theoretical framework
current research aims validate concept passive risk show separate domain risk taking behavior
concept risk been extensively studied last decades
there different definitions risk but most distinguish between certain probable outcomes marking riskier choice one greater outcome variance
