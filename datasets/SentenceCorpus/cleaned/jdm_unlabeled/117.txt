 
three experiments tested if individuals show violations transitivity choices between risky gambles linked designs
binary gambles varied probability win higher better prize value higher prize value lower prize
each design varied two factors third fixed
designs linked using same values different designs
linked designs allow one determine if lexicographic semiorder model describe violations transitivity more than one design using same parameters
addition two experiments tested interactive independence critical property implied all lexicographic semiorder models
very few people showed systematic violations transitivity only one person out number showed violations transitivity two designs could linked lexicographic semiorder
however person violated interactive independence did majority other participants
most individuals showed systematic violations assumptions stochastic independence stationarity choice responses
means investigators should evaluate models respect response patterns response combinations rather than focusing entirely choice proportions
 introduction 
descriptive theories risky decision making divided into two groups those satisfy transitivity preference those do not
transitivity preference assumption if person prefers b prefers b c then person should prefer c apart random error
use x number b denote preference so property denoted follows x number b b b x number b c x number d number x number b c
theories represent each gamble single number automatically imply transitivity
theories assume x number b b x number d number ua greater than ub where ua ub numerical values utilities two gambles
expected utility theory eu cumulative prospect theory cpt transfer attention exchange model tax well many other theories fall class theories satisfy transitivity
theories represent choice terms contrasts between components alternatives however need not satisfy transitivity preference
theories violate transitivity include family lexicographic semiorder ls models priority heuristic regret theory rt stochastic difference model sdm others
