propose novel theory whereby people's level agency influences relative intensities their social motives thus their social preferences
agency context refers decision makers' active involvement processes produce social outcomes
nonagentic decision makers not involved creating outcomes
therefore comparison between self others highly informative them they shun settings their outcome appears inferior
conversely agentic decision makers who take action influence social outcomes care more about others' outcomes more inclined promote social welfare
report five studies testing agency hypothesis
participants were presented realistic scenarios involving outcomes themselves another person
each scenario outcome oneself was fixed while outcome other person varied
participants' task was indicate their satisfaction other person obtaining either same outcome their own better one
found participants who were involved creating outcomes agentic condition were more satisfied other getting better option than were participants who were not involved nonagentic condition
even low levels influence outcomes were sufficient strong agency effect occur
discuss agency hypothesis relation theories social preference effects voicing participation decision processes trade-offs public policy
 introduction 
imagine following scenario
after buying new camera you find out colleague yours bought same camera
you consider possibility she might bought camera less than you so you ask her how much she paid
would you rather find out she paid same price you less
two conflicting reactions might surface your mind
particular you might worry your outcome would look poorer comparison thus you would prefer find out she paid same price not less
yet you might hope find out she paid less since benefits her does not cost you anything
people's reactions scenarios reflect their social preferences their satisfaction social outcomes obtained themselves others
decision makers' social preferences settings like camera scenario involve conflict between two social motives-avoidance inferior social comparisons concern about well-being others
propose decision makers' resolution conflict hence their social preferences depend their experience agency setting
thus people's social preferences depend heavily whether not they role creating outcomes
people tend more other-regarding their preferences extent they agency situation
role agency been documented recent studies participants were first paid performing task lab were then asked consider pay another matched participant same task
participants one condition were asked determine salary matched participant while participants another condition were asked indicate how satisfied they would various predetermined salaries matched participant
participants who chose outcomes were far more generous than participants who rated their satisfaction predetermined outcomes
particular they were more likely favor option paying another participant more than they had received themselves
choshen-hillel yaniv attributed shift social preference participants' level agency
individuals considered nonagentic when they experience social outcomes were not brought about their intentional actions
contrast individuals considered agentic when they act purposefully produce social outcomes outcomes being related their actions
how might agency affect social preferences
proposed theory draws insights theories social comparison social utility
been suggested individuals generally sensitive social comparisons tend draw self-inferences based differences they observe between themselves others
people said interpret differences favor others negative signals about their own social status consequently tend shun settings evoke uncomfortable comparisons
our suggestion settings where individuals hold nonagentic roles their inequality aversion so strong dominates their prosocial motives
individuals who hold agentic roles however balance between motives changes
agentic individuals do not view comparison conveying important social information since consequence their own deliberate action
being involved creating outcomes others they also care more about welfare others effect consistent notions warm glow welfare maximization
thus agentic individuals compared nonagentic ones pay less attention unfavorable inequalities care more about maximizing social welfare
our theoretical analysis suggests people construct their social preferences depending their level agency setting
applying analysis camera scenario implies people should express more other-regarding preferences when they involved creating outcome other person than when they not
