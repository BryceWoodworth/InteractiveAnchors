experiment number reveals asymmetric judgment pattern
jofs reflected actual presentation frequency quite accurately were unbiased exposure duration
conversely jods were almost insensitive actual exposure duration were systematically biased presentation frequency

implications findings underlying memory mechanisms discussed
 introduction 
event frequency duration fundamental importance behavioral adaptation
predators instance increase their chances survival if they approach areas where prey resides more frequently longer periods time
conversely prey should strive avoid areas where predators roam frequently consistently
consider individual who must decide where go hunting probability maximizing individual's yield function frequency length time duration prey lingers certain area
assume individual experienced hunter who often visited different areas past observed behavior prey animals
further assume observations made would represent valid sample prey animals' migrations
order properly adapt his own behavior environment hunter should use frequentistic temporal information his subsequent choice
requires two abilities first individual must capable discriminating differences frequency duration second representations frequency duration must stored memory so they used later judgment decision making
psychologists various fields studied processing duration frequency extensively
their approaches however differ
research animal cognition neuropsychology focuses primarily discrimination short term storage
cognitive psychologists often interested memory processes whereas jdm researchers mainly consider judgmental heuristics
fields host different theoretical perspectives apply different research paradigms arrive at diverging interpretations phenomena
consider example case frequency judgment
cognitive psychologists normally employ learning procedures induce frequency knowledge laboratory usually find participants subsequently make quite accurate judgments
they explain their findings reference general models memory
conversely jdm researchers often investigate factors cause changes judgment accuracy explain their results reference judgmental heuristics
separation between research fields been often lamented but there increasing number researchers striving towards integration both methodological theoretical level paper report studies using research paradigm cognitive psychology induce knowledge about frequency duration
compare judgments two related domains judgments duration jod judgments frequency jof
manipulate conditions encoding assess their effects judgmental patterns
specifically compare jod jof regarding differences their retrospective sensitivity differences their susceptibility biases
approach seek increase our knowledge fundamental memory processes
knowledge may help achieve better understanding variations judgment
remainder introduction give brief overview state research processing frequency duration arrive at working hypothesis regarding storage entities memory
ample evidence indicates organisms remarkably good at discriminating differences frequency duration
like animals adult humans even young children capable effectively discriminating low range frequencies n less than number
similarly humans like many other species able discriminate temporal information across wide range intervals  circadian timing timing seconds even milliseconds
discrimination very short durations millisecond range particular seems very accurate
all together research findings suggest common mental mechanism drives discrimination both stimulus dimensions  frequency duration
granting findings discrimination one may tempted assume frequency duration would also affect storage memory similar fashion
according common-path hypothesis figure number frequency duration would commensurate effects stimulus' representation r subsequent judgment instance they may both change accessibility strength event memory
changes strength could modeled different theoretical approaches memory
connectionist-network models frequency duration may conceived change strength associations among r its features other constituents network
multiple-trace models strength primarily conceived function number traces representing stimulus event at least if encoding response criteria constant
other things being equal trace number assumed increase function encounter frequency
may also increase function duration because prolonged exposure may entail repetitive encoding event
regardless underlying mechanism common-path hypothesis assumes same property memory used subsequent judgments
accordingly jof jod should made through assessments strength r memory
one main prediction derived common-path hypothesis jof jod should symmetrically biased
accordingly jof should biased exposure duration while jod should biased exposure frequency
empirical evidence common-path hypothesis however mixed
supporting evidence stems mostly jdm research heuristics assumed use memory strength predictor quantitative judgments
example when applying availability heuristic individual thought estimate criterion assessing ease stimulus stimuli rehearsed memory
fluency heuristic employs similar process more fluently stimulus processed due previous exposure higher estimation criterion
line notion some studies provided evidence exposure duration biases subsequent jof
example williams durso varied duration words number number number number sec between subjects
they found subsequent frequency judgments were systematically biased duration
specifically longer category exemplars were shown presentation higher estimated size category higher probability exemplars could reproduced free recall test
lewandowsky smith found similar effects earlier
employing within-subjects design they varied exposure duration number number number number number sec assessed effects frequency judgments recall
both measures were positively correlated exposure duration
similarily jod were found systematically biased frequency
ornstein showed retrospective judgments time intervals reflected number available events filled episode
hintzman reported evidence showing jod systematically reflected exposure frequency stimulus but see discussion paper next section
taken together findings support assumptions common-path hypothesis because jof jod seem behave symmetrically regard biases
conclusive test however requires us consider two other aspects judgment pattern
one relative strength biases other judgment sensitivity judgment sensitivity refers degree experienced differences duration frequency reproduced judgments
end one must compare jof jod within same experiment
approach was applied earlier memory research
seminal paper hintzman varied frequency four levels number number number number repetitions duration five levels number number number number number seconds within-subjects design
after presentation he asked participants either judge frequency each word occurred duration was shown average trial
hintzman found jof showed remarkable sensitivity actual differences exposure repetition
moreover jof were only weakly affected differences duration
conversely judgment sensitivity was comparatively lower jod
another difference already noted previous section jod were systematically influenced biased actual frequency
hintzman concluded asymmetric pattern results differences retrospective sensitivity uni-directional bias violates common-path hypothesis suggests frequency duration affect memory different fashion
hintzman reported similar results subsequent studies
all together empirical evidence line research suggests frequency duration stored differently memory
findings reported so far form incoherent picture
duration biases jof sometimes occur sometimes do not
jod seem more susceptible biases than jof but there also evidence opposite
there several possible explanations mixed evidence
important one type judgment task differs between studies
jod some studies use retrospective tasks some use prospective tasks
jof most studies documenting duration biases jof used set-size tasks
participants estimated size categories containing different exemplars
contrast duration biases jof less pronounced tasks assess judgment event frequencies
another possible explanation encoding conditions may differ across tasks studies
encoding frequency requires comparatively little attention stimulus
one must simply realize stimulus occurs
encoding duration however requires individual additionally sustains attention stimulus entire period its presence
differences procedures materials may differentially affect individual's inclination attend stimuli proportionate actual duration
literature time perception widespread notion attention crucial variable time processing
consequently differences result patterns might caused differences encoding rather than differences memory
without systematically considering encoding conditions might premature conclusion dismiss common-path hypothesis
present research focuses role encoding conditions jod jof
three experiments varied total duration frequency stimuli orthogonally within same experimental design
specifically presentation stimuli differed regard repetition frequency number number number times total summed duration they appeared screen number number number sec
resulting number frequency x number duration factorial design was always implemented within subjects
following stimuli presentation participants made jof jod
specifically they judged frequency event's occurrence its total duration exps number number number its single average duration exp number generally assess pattern judgment central dependent variable
takes two dimensions into account  judgment sensitivity biases
judgment sensitivity refers extent individuals able reproduce differences stimulus dimensions their judgments
biases indicators type memory representation underlying judgment
experiment number serves baseline study did not control encoding conditions
experiment number compares different conditions focus attention during encoding
experiment number compares different types stimulus formats differ likelihood holding observer's attention stimuli during encoding
