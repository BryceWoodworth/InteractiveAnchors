number options increases people more likely put off making active choice i e defer show less satisfaction any purchase actually made
extend line enquiry choosing charitable organisation volunteer
issue important because number voluntary organisations enormous impact decision may greater than consumer decisions terms time commitment benefits volunteer society
study number asked students examine real volunteering website record how many organisations they considered decision difficulty whether not they would like sign up chosen organisation prefer defer decision
study number presented either relatively small number large number choice set hypothetical organisations measured deferment likelihood decision difficulty
both studies more options considered greater likelihood defer

research first find detrimental effects excess choice extend volunteering
implications volunteer recruitment discussed
 introduction 
western societies place great value provision extensive choice
choice argued enhances ability match individual preferences outcomes associated feelings personal autonomy well-being people tend react negatively when choice restricted
however benefits extensive choice need considered alongside potential costs
research suggests instance too much choice may encourage confusion choice deferment well reduction satisfaction chosen options
moreover economic theory long recognised options become more similar opportunity costs next best alternative foregone also rise
tension between wanting more options but finding them difficult deal been referred paradox choice
date however much research focused consumer decision making products jams chocolates pens soft drinks sweets gift boxes music still know very little about whether paradox choice exists more consequential decisions
aim current research was investigate whether extensive choice undermines decision making respect potentially more meaningful decision context namely choosing organisation volunteer
volunteering one's time without concern financial gain serious time commitment many individuals been linked range volunteer benefits greater life satisfaction improved health skill development better job prospects well obvious benefits others
consequently implications individual deciding organisation volunteer potentially much larger than many consumer contexts explored previously
like many consumer contexts however charity volunteer sector one where excess choice abounds
example number number charities registered uk alone
moreover national centre social research institute volunteering research estimates economic benefit uk volunteering around xa number number billion annually
current uk government placed increased volunteering at heart its big society agenda
if plethora organisations indeed detrimental volunteer recruitment could major effect service delivery success big society other similar initiatives
understanding how people make decisions about selecting volunteer organisations how best structure choices aid people's decision making could therefore considerable policy implications
research into volunteer recruitment students very important population investigate
age stage life when many people begin volunteering first time
uk instance around number percent first year students more than number number students total volunteer each year through organised volunteering programmes at their higher education institutions student volunteering england sve number
key motivations include wanting learn new skills number number percent gain experience their future career
contribution economy estimated around xa number number million pounds
importantly students also tend continue volunteering after leaving college
us college graduates were more likely volunteer number number percent than people without college experience number number percent were also more likely still volunteering later life
present studies focus potential extensive choice increase likelihood individuals will put off making immediate decision instead defer decision later
given general propensity not revisit deferred decisions could important implications volunteer recruitment
our primary hypothesis was number organisations considered potential volunteers increases likelihood they will state preference defer decision will also increase
study number subjects were asked explore one main uk volunteering websites choose organisation they would most like volunteer
association between number options considered deferment likelihood was then tested
study number presented subjects either large relatively small choice set hypothetical organisations deferment preferences were again recorded
our secondary hypothesis was feelings confusion difficulty lack confidence during decision process might mediate effect
