 
research identified loss aversion strong robust phenomenon but also revealed some moderators affecting magnitude its effect decision making
current article draw attention fact even measurement loss aversion itself may affect its magnitude inducing focus either losses gains
three studies provide empirical evidence measurement-induced focus
all studies used coin-toss gambles-in there number number chance win lose-to assess gain loss ratios measure loss aversion
participants either filled out loss side gain side gain loss ratio
studies consistently showed that-using within between-subject designs anticipated real coin-toss gambles-the strength loss aversion depended measurement format fill-in-the-loss versus fill-in-the-gain filling loss side increased loss aversion
moreover loss aversion was more affected stakes gamble fill-in-the-loss format than fill-in-the-gain format
 introduction 
when making decisions decision-makers consider potential outcomes thus consider potential losses gains may occur
example when speculating stock exchange consider potential losses should stock go down potential gains should stocks go up
when making decisions-especially when people directly compare potential losses gains-people often give more weight losses
larger weight given negative outcomes generally referred loss aversion i e losses loom larger than gains
addition stock market decisions loss aversion been used explain many effects observed context decision making sunk cost effect status quo bias endowment effect
although existence loss aversion well-accepted there still work done developing better accounts its causes boundaries consequences
example researchers generally assume potential gains need approximately twice large offset potential losses
they introduced loss aversion coefficient-the ratio g l gains losses makes even chance gain g lose l just acceptable
they observed gain loss ratio number number number their experiments showing gains average need twice large losses make even chance gain g lose l acceptable
current paper however will argue show loss aversion ratio not constant but fact influenced how measured
show ratio approximately number when people focus gains compared loss but ratio increases when people focus losses compared gain
