our first experiment performing computer-based persian version iowa gambling task igt our subjects scored remarkably lower than their western counterparts
moreover our subjects chose more frequently more rapidly decks had less frequent but larger amounts punishments comparison decks had more frequent punishments smaller amounts
our second experiment subjects did not differentiate between decks same frequency punishment but different punishment amounts
however among decks same amount but different frequency punishment significant preference was apparent towards decks less frequency punishment
our results differ previous studies indicating different strategy risky decision making among healthy adult iranian subjects they show low attention amount punishment more concerned frequency punishment
 introduction 
risky decision making rdm defined cognitive process individual chooses available options according her assessment value reward punishment associated choices
assessment based individual's previous experiences obtained information about possible outcomes options
factors amount frequency reward punishment probability their occurrence delay their presentation influence more favorable choice subject
various studies shown decision making also affected emotional valence assigned each option based previous experiences
when making choice decision maker recognizes current situation analogous some previous experience draws inferences her previous choices
options history yielding larger more frequent more probable rewards more favorable effect our reward emotional processing systems therefore more likely chosen
fact our subjective intuitions may bias us make decisions not necessarily rational but emotionally favorable
research decision making general psychology suffer greatly focusing solely subject populations same culture
due need move single population based models also because rapid globalization commerce influence culture decision making become topic interest both psychologists economists
influence culture probability judgments risk perception risk preference been extensively explored researchers different fields
hsee weber report subjects collectivist cultures east asian cultures more risk-seeking because they larger social cushion fall back case losses
addition they found differences not due differences attitudes towards risk rather something about how risk perceived construed
social cultural causes known leave traces reflected variety cultural products proverbs cultural
iranian proverb providing advice when choosing between short term long term benefits reads cash slap face worth more than credit halva
proverb recommends people prefer instant gratification even if slap face over sweeter payoff paid sometime future
cultural products created over generations responsible storing transmitting cultural wisdom well current economic political status nation affect different aspects people's judgment decision making
believe halva proverb many others similar messages highlight influence social-economic causes years war instability social-political atmosphere iranian culture
there not been rigorous cross-cultural experiments focusing decision making middle-eastern cultures
paper report cross cultural differences rdm comparing results iranian subjects results same rdm assessment test performed western cultures
due factors religious restrictions gambling multiple regime changes years war expect iranians perform somewhat differently their western counterparts
moreover investigate effect frequency contrast amount reward punishment rdm among iranians
close discussion about some potential reasons some differences
