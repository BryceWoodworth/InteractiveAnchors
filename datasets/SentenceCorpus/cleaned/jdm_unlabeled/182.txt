 
according deliberation without attention dwa hypothesis people facing difficult choice will make better decision after period distraction than after equally long period conscious deliberation effect referred unconscious thought advantage uta
status dwa hypothesis controversial many studies tried but failed replicate uta
here report series experiments sought identify conditions under uta replicated
our starting point was recent meta-analysis identified conditions under uta was strongest previous studies
using within-subjects design task met each conditions failed replicate uta
based closer inspection previous methods findings then examined some additional factors could important replicating uta including mental fatigue choice complexity
was no avail results revealed only significant conscious thought advantage when choice complexity was increased relative first experiment
subsequently conducted exploratory analyses data across experiments found male subjects showed significant conscious thought advantage while female subjects showed trend towards uta
taken together our results suggest replication uta may depend more characteristics sample than characteristics task they suggest gender could source variance outcomes previous studies using between-subjects design
 introduction 
throughout life people face variety decisions involve choices between options many relevant attributes
instance deciding university program enroll one needs consider goals getting best possible education minimizing distance family friends finding nice place live
rational approach solving complex decision problem would involve comparing different options evaluating extent they satisfy goals
perform decision analysis one would preferably use external aids computer pencil paper writing out decision problem performing required computations
but what if you do not option using external aids instead rely memory mental information processing capacity making complex decisions
while conventional wisdom suggests one should think carefully before making difficult choice deliberation without attention dwa hypothesis proposed dijksterhuis colleagues argues otherwise
specifically hypothesis claims complex decisions best made without conscious deliberation following period during conscious deliberation about choice at hand prevented means performing unrelated attention-demanding task
support hypothesis dijksterhuis et al reported results experiment consisted three phases
information acquisition phase subjects received information about four fictional cars were each described terms number characteristics could positive fuel efficient negative does not airbags
one cars had nine positive characteristics whereas two had six one had only three
characteristics were presented one after other subjects were instructed form thorough impression each car
following information acquisition phase one group subjects was told they had four minutes think carefully about options before they would asked make choice
comprised conscious thought condition
other group was told they would first do another task-solving anagrams-for four minutes before they would asked make choice
comprised unconscious thought condition
results between-subjects comparison showed subjects unconscious thought condition performed better than those conscious deliberation condition latter performing at chance picking out best car
other words subjects who were given opportunity think about cars made worse choices than those who did not think about cars due distracting task
explain their surprising finding dijksterhuis nordgren proposed aforementioned dwa hypothesis
hypothesis claims processing earlier presented information will continue at unconscious level during execution distracting task effectively producing preference will guide one's decision when choice eventually needs made
explain why unconscious form deliberation produces better choices than conscious deliberation dijksterhuis colleagues further proposed unconscious thought much greater capacity processing information than conscious thought
hence unconscious thought would better suited dealing complex decisions consequence momentary distraction would result unconscious thought advantage uta case decisions involving many options many characteristics relevance
claiming people should rely unconscious processing make better choices dwa hypothesis readily attracted attention public media readily attracted criticism other scientists
dijksterhuis' claims were considered misleading potentially harmful researchers were quick offer alternative explanations uta
nevertheless unconscious thought paradigm took flight researchers started investigate boundary conditions uta
work indicated uta not very robust phenomenon many studies failed replicate spite using similar methods those dijksterhuis used
at same time however dijksterhuis other researchers produced number replications extensions uta
short available literature currently features number published studies together report total number experiments quality judgments decisions was compared between conscious unconscious deliberation condition see table number
experiments number replicated uta some form while number showed no significant difference performance four showed significantly better performance conscious thought condition conscious thought advantage cta
given most experiments listed table number used methods materials similar those used dijksterhuis intriguing question why results experiments could so inconsistent
address matter strick dijksterhuis colleagues conducted meta-analysis comprehensive collection published unpublished datasets they examined number methodological details differed between studies
results showed averaged across studies uta remained significant pooled effect size number
more importantly results also showed there indeed quite few methodological details significant influence magnitude uta
moderators not only pertained nature choices had made but also manner information acquisition deliberation phases were implemented different studies
specifically analysis strick et al showed effect sizes were larger studies employed more complex decisions predicted dwa hypothesis
analysis also showed uta absent when subjects different goal than evaluating options later judgment choice most studies when subjects led focus specific aspects information instead forming general impression each options most studies
addition uta was found stronger when information about choice alternatives was presented grouped per alternative instead randomly intermixed across alternatives when information was presented at relatively high pace when information was accompanied pictorial information
regard deliberation phase analysis showed uta was stronger when duration phase was relatively short when task used distract subjects unconscious thought condition involved solving word-search puzzles instead solving anagrams performing verbal working memory task
