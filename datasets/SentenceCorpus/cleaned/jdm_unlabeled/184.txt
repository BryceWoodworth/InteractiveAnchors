 
three experiments investigated individuals' preferences affective reactions negative life experiences
participants had more intense negative affective reaction when they were exposed highly negative life experience than when they were exposed two negative events highly negative mildly negative life event
participants also chose situation containing two versus one negative event
thus more negative events were better when events had different affective intensities
when participants were exposed events having similar affective intensities however two negative events produced more intense negative affective reaction
addition participants chose situation having one versus two negative life experiences
thus more negative events were worse when events had similar affective intensities
results consistent averaging summation s model delineate situations when more negative life events better when more negative life events worse
results also ruled out several alternative interpretations including peak-end rule mental accounting interpretations
 introduction 
more worse when comes negative life events
conclusion follows behavioral approaches
behavioral accounts addition negatively valenced stimulus already negatively valenced context should reduce approach preference tendencies
averaging summation s model demonstrated individuals' feelings preferences sometimes but not always sum affective values associated each event example individuals may not always feel more negative after experiencing compound event containing both highly negative plus mildly negative event than they feel after experiencing singular highly negative one
model incorporates findings judgment social-influence literatures
averaging example was found judgment literature when individuals were given traits cues had discrepant values see however our discussion set size effects section number number whereas summation each individual's impact was seen social influence audience literatures where participants typically performed task front spectators having similar impact ratings similar status levels
s model averaging effects not relegated judgment domain summation effects not relegated social influence domain
rather individuals' responses reflect sensitivity sum values associated each event well central seeking tendencies  average value events
see appendix quantitative expression model
model was initially developed provide theoretical account how individuals respond simultaneous presence one multiple audience members having heterogeneous homogeneous status levels
