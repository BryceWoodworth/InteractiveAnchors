 
people often more likely accept risky monetary gambles positive expected values when gambles will played more than once
investigated whether distinction between single-play multiple-play gambles extends medical treatments individual patients groups patients
resident physicians medical students n number undergraduates n number ranked number different flu shots no-flu-shot option number number combinations perspective individual patient vs group number patients uncertainty frame probability vs frequency
rank no-flu-shot option measure preference treatment vs no treatment was not significantly related perspective participant population
main effect uncertainty frame interaction between perspective uncertainty frame approached significance number number greater than p greater than number number no-flu-shot option faring particularly poorly treatment faring particularly well when decisions about many patients were based frequency information
undergraduate participants believed no-flu-shot option would less attractive treatment would more attractive decisions about many patients but intuitions were inconsistent actual ranks
results those other studies suggest medical treatments individuals groups not analogous single-play multiple-play monetary gambles perhaps because many people unwilling aggregate treatment outcomes over patients same way they would compute net gains losses over monetary gambles
 introduction 
convincing body research demonstrates people often make different choices when making multiple-play decisions than when making single-play decisions
samuelson initiated literature revealing anecdote about lunch colleague who would reject single gamble even chance winning number losing number but who would accept series number gambles
subsequently several studies indicated people more likely accept mixed gambles i e gambles involving possible gain possible loss positive expected values evs when gambles will played more than once although opposite result been also been observed
multiple plays samuelson-type gambles particularly attractive when participants shown distribution possible outcomes resulting repeated plays
although rationality making different choices single-play multiple-play gambles been debated article concerned primarily empirical distinction
related research shows multiple plays may also increase attractiveness higher-ev unmixed gambles reduce incidence certainty possibility effects reduce choosing pricing preference reversals reduce illusion control facilitate multiplicative combination probabilities outcomes
taken together results indicate choices preferences often more consistent expected value theory expected utility theory when multiple plays considered
