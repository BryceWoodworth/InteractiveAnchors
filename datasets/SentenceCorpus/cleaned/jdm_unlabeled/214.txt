our estimation parameters probability weighting function proposed tversky kahneman similar those obtained previous studies lottery choice negative monetary payoffs negative hypothetical payoffs

our results provide evidence probability weighting general phenomenon independent source disutility
 introduction 
expected utility theory eut standard theoretical model choice under risk used economic analysis
eut posits utility assigned lottery prospect linear probability each possible outcome lottery
while eut appealing formulation economic modeling number experiments called into question descriptive model choice under risk see starmer review literature
other hand specifications allowing probabilities weighted function pip where pip inverted s-shape provide good empirical fit available experimental data
inverted s-shape corresponds overweighting low probabilities underweighting high probabilities
recognition empirical support probability weighting incorporated key assumption several theories choice under risk including prospect theory rank dependent expected utility theory cumulative prospect theory
particularly striking phenomenon arise consequence probability weighting common ratio violation
consider two lotteries individual utility function ux
first yields payoff x not-equals number probability p zero payoff probability numberp second lottery yields x not-equals number probability p zero otherwise
linearity assumption expected utility theory implies individual who chooses first lottery over second one must also choose lottery delivers x probability q p over lottery yields x probability q p
clearly if pux greater than equal pux then q pux greater than equal q pux
originally conjectured allais common ratio violations result indifference curves probability triangle explained later fan out fan been found widespread domain positive payoffs lotteries involving monetary outcomes
empirical support underlying probability weighting common ratio violations comes primarily experimental studies all outcomes involve non-negative monetary payments
however many economic decisions involve possibility losses
examples include decision invest stock choose among alternative medical procedures trust another person institution business personal transaction
few studies explored decisions domain losses they used one two techniques induce negative payoffs
some studies researchers use hypothetical payoffs examples include kahneman tversky abdellaoui
other studies participants given real cash endowment at beginning experiment real losses deducted initial balance examples include holt laury mason et al
however many real life decisions involve negative outcomes not monetary
consider cancer patient who asked make choice between two uncomfortable medical treatments involve tradeoffs between probabilities utilities different prospective states health e g radiation therapy versus extensive surgery
another example decision defendant criminal case accept reject plea bargain reduced sentence prison
defendant faces choice between lotteries over time incarceration
however methodological challenge exists when studying decisions over non-monetary adverse outcomes how do induce real outcomes type laboratory
some authors used aversive stimuli investigate other principles decision making
example ariely et al used annoying sounds well having subjects place their fingers inside tightening vice study effects anchoring preferences
coursey et al required individuals drink sucrose octa-acetate unpleasant tasting liquid study willingness-to-pay willingness-to-accept decisions bad good negative value
paper use painful electric shocks induce negative payoffs
pain good measure disutility almost everyone would rather avoid
addition means inducing disutility use electric shocks satisfies smith's precepts pertaining appropriateness reward medium experiment monotonicity dominance
presume larger shock either magnitude duration worse than smaller one
fixed duration disutility shock monotonic current therefore monotonic its voltage
furthermore our simple decision task described below given voltage levels applied our experiment quite reasonable presume differences between voltage levels alternative choices large enough dominate costs deciding between alternatives
physical pain unlike cash payments also other advantages inducing individual incentives recipient consumes instantly cannot transfer other individuals
paper consider whether phenomenon probability weighting particular inverted s-shaped pattern probability distortion observed when people face lotteries involve painful shocks whether common ratio violations been observed lotteries involving positive monetary payments also appear our setting
addition although probability weighting predict complex pattern fanning fanning out inside probability triangle particular gambles consider expect see more risk aversion when gambles get better i e when there lower overall chance shock means indifference curves would tend fan-out
find both probability weighting common ratio violations prominent features our data
median probability weighting parameter estimate very similar those observed decisions over negative hypothetical monetary payoffs
results suggest similar process probability weighting characterizes lottery choice both monetary non-monetary outcomes when payoffs negative
