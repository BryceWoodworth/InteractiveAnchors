 introduction 
many decisions repeated over time accordingly results past decisions substantial impact future decisions
financial analysts make repeated decisions involving gains losses charting financial data common method used summarize past performance companies markets
runs consecutive gains losses frequently depicted charts generally some their more noticeable characteristics
behavioral finance researchers believe run patterns so prominent runs affect future predictions made analysts
influence troubling because runs highlighted shefrin's quote often occur naturally without any special underlying cause
shefrin emphasized folly basing financial predictions solely run patterns he provided case studies financial experts illustrate poor decisions
one example involved prediction number senior investment adviser merrill lynch
after exceptionally long period high returns equities analyst incorrectly forecast below average returns were inevitable after long run gains
unfortunately analyst there was number number percent increase dow jones index close trading year
analyst committed classic gambler's fallacy believing long runs outcomes low frequency occurrence therefore runs more likely end longer they continue
but assume any investors who decreased their investment equities at time were doing so because gambler's fallacy
there no doubt humans susceptible biased probabilistic reasoning when judging predicting runs random near random binary events
but runs losses gains not like other binary events because consequences events also financial impact decision maker
run losses will result depletion financial resources just run gains will result increase financial resources
but most real-world laboratory-based studies impact runs gains losses risk preferences focused solely biased reasoning explanations disregarded explanations based financial impacts runs
example sundali croson examined prevalence gambler's fallacy hot hand gamblers playing roulette casino
hot hand another decision bias result betting random events
decision makers who follow hot hand heuristic behave if runs gains losses likely continue possibly because winning creates illusion control
result decision makers risk more after run gains risk less after run losses
sundali croson tested hot hand effect looking at number bets gamblers made after win after loss
researchers assumed hot hand bias would cause gamblers make more bets after win than after loss they found many gamblers who produced betting behaviors
however researchers also admitted same pattern risk preferences could result concurrent changes financial state occur during runs gains losses
they suggested gamblers could also place more bets after win because they feel richer
however sundali croson had no way recording financial status gamblers their study
laboratory studies allow researcher examine how runs gains losses influence risk preferences whilst controlling financial status decision maker
most previous studies gains losses laboratory settings not implemented control
example johnson tellis macinnis examined effects runs losses gains single simulated investment decision
investment decision was based stock reports highlighted run gains losses immediately prior investment decision
length run was manipulated researchers
majority participants varied their choice basis prior runs researchers explained choices terms hot hand gambler's fallacy
although research important implications one-off investment decisions experimental design fails capture dynamic nature sequential risky choice
prior run gains losses had no direct effect financial status participants subsequently no effect choices made participants
not surprisingly reasons provided participants experiment appeared indicate biased probabilistic reasoning
one laboratory study did attempt capture dynamic more complex aspects sequential risky choices was conducted leopard
study participants were provided long sequence binary gambles where riskiness gambles was manipulated changing variance amount lost gained
although experimental manipulation does not change actual risk gamble i e expected value remains same each choice previous research shown participants perceive gambles larger variance riskier choices
example winning losing number number perceived riskier than winning losing number number
leopard allowed runs gains losses occur naturally during long sequences random events participants were requested play until they had lost their starting bank number number until they had played number gambles
leopard recorded run valence loss vs gain run length before each choice was made also recorded current bank participant each time gamble was played
leopard tested run effects conducting kruskal wallis non-parametric equivalent anova analysis gamble risk each run length
runs losses were coded negative run value runs gains were coded positive run value
significant run effect was found number percent her participants each participant's data summarized figure number
leopard then grouped participants basis visual inspection graphs displayed figure number
she inferred eight participants had followed gambler's fallacy figure number three participants had shown hot hand effect figure number b
she also found two participants who provided non-linear risk preferences she labeled participants incurable optimists figure number c
she believed participants increased their risk because they perceived long runs any type signal positive outcome imminent
leopard's conclusions raise several questions
leopard admitted outcome financial state inherently confounded some degree at least some subjects p number
many participants leopard's study provided significant relationships between risk preference financial state including all but three participants displayed figure number
addition her classification participants relied solely visual inspection data graphed figure number
however unclear whether linear non-linear patterns required classifications were actually statistically significant
addition consistent trends were not always evident both types runs gains losses across full range run lengths
many participants figures number number b showed stronger non-linear trends run length increased run valence changed
non-linear trends could reflect change risk strategy during times
finally outcomes each participant's gambles were random therefore participant's financial state at times when runs occurred could varied dramatically within between participants
leopard does not provide any information about how many participants failed complete number trials what financial state each participant was at end each experimental session
not out question participant may experienced runs only when down their initial bank alternatively experienced runs only when up their initial bank
difficulty using random event sequences there no control over when runs will occur what type run will occur how long each run will
goal current study improve leopard study controlling type runs length runs when runs occur respect participant's financial state
more thorough statistical analysis data collected will also provide better justification speculated causes risk preference patterns during runs gains losses
i hypothesize financial status will affect risk preferences but runs gains losses will still influence risk preferences independently effects status
latter hypothesis based evidence decision makers highly predisposed faulty probabilistic reasoning involving repeated random binary events
consequently linear patterns risk preferences follow gambler's fallacy negative slope hot hand positive slope still expected
however other participants may show significant non-linear relationships between run variables risk preference there two possible explanations non-linear patterns
prior research found perceptions runs may not linearly related length
carlson schu recently reported incremental reaction sequence repeated outcomes often peaks at three consecutive outcomes plateaus after third event
second explanation non-linear effects participant follows different strategies runs different lengths valence
example self-perception being lucky winner after couple wins row will compete growing misperception streak must end if continues grow
eventually latter perception may win out change risk preference occurs leading non-linear pattern risk preferences
i hypothesize use risk strategies during runs gains losses much more dynamic transient than suggested previous research
