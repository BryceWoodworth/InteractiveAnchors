 
type emergency decision-making not received research attention police search lost person rural wilderness area
many incidents decisions concerning where search lost subject made planning team each member assigns probabilities various hypotheses about where subject might located including residual hypothesis subject somewhere else entirely outside designated search area
current study number adult males search planning experience were asked assign probabilities fictional lost person incident
was hypothesized according support theory subjects who first considered five possible scenarios accounting how subject could left search area-i e unpacked residual hypothesis-would subsequently increase their probability estimate global hypothesis missing subject was not designated search area compared those subjects who unpacked focal hypothesis
hypothesis was confirmed
also found considerable evidence subadditivity most subjects estimated higher summed probabilities individual scenarios accounting focal residual hypotheses respectively
potential negative consequences unpacking effects during lost person incident were discussed possible means mitigating effects were described
 introduction 
past two decades seen growing interest manner emergency responders make decisions field
example klein his colleagues studied decision-making processes various types emergency managers fire commanders who required initiate appropriate response their respective emergencies early their incidents possible
researchers found emergency managers whom they studied rarely consider alternative options simultaneously analytic fashion
rather manager's decision making follows pattern termed satisficing first satisfactory option comes mind selected
expertise emergency managers according klein reflected their ability quickly categorize emergency according their experience imagine scenario particular course action toward resolving emergency could successfully implemented
one type emergency response not studied klein his associates police search person lost large scale rural wilderness area topic only recently become focus research behavioral scientists
variety people become targets searches including hunters hikers anglers other outdoor enthusiasts well children who wander away camp rural homes elderly people suffering senile dementia
organized searches lost people usually come under authority public safety personnel county sheriffs regional state police officers conservation officers park rangers
north america search management system prescribed national association search rescue nearly universally recognized best practice model organizing lost person incident itself application incident command system endorsed u s federal emergency management agency managing all emergency incidents
below system will described pertains decision making processes other cognitive variables particularly subjective judgments probability
lost person incident begins decision subject missing person report may spatially disoriented large rural environment forested area
incidents usually considered highly urgent factors related health age weather natural hazards may threaten subject's safety
most u s states canadian provinces officer who given authority incident at his her disposal any number resources assistance including other officers personnel other agencies civilian search rescue volunteers including field searchers search dog handlers search coordinators
even before searchers arrive at location where search will conducted search management team will appointed first operational period usually number hours
upon arrival at scene incident commander-in consultation other members search management team-will set motion routinized efforts quickly locate missing subject tasking searchers canine teams track missing person place last seen pls
well efforts confine subject search locale will usually implemented setting up trail blocks some distance away pls
after first steps initiated however incident commander will confer search management team concerted planning session strikingly unlike satisficing process described klein
environmental psychologists heth cornell who studied decision-making processes search managers cogently described typical planning session unlike most paramilitary operations there surprising amount consensual decision making
experienced search rescue command teams believe no one person authoritatively state best course action
like naval navigation teams described hutchins there fixed responsibilities social hierarchies when operations executed but contrast authoritarian decisive control experienced search managers seek consultation develop their hypotheses plans modestly one four others
during discussions search rescue planning team makes search tractable parsing environment developing scenarios what likely happened lost person
thereafter search management consists largely iterative task assignments individuals teams dispatched check possibilities
methodology bayesian planning team will revise its priorities basis field reports search teams along clues eyewitness reports similar evidence uncovered during search activities
specifically planning session involves identifying primary search area search activities will conducted then dividing larger area into any number smaller segments single search resources e g dog teams search crews tasked
once segments identified drawn planning map attempt made prioritize segments order ensure those areas most likely contain missing subject searched relatively early incident
prioritization accomplished requiring search planners assign estimates probability each segments termed probability area poa
well methodology involves assigning some nontrivial probability rest world row all area outside designated search area will likely not searched during operational period
individual probability judgments then combined averaged yielding planning poa reflects consensual probabilities subject may located within each segment well row
mentioned quote above methodology bayesian initial subjective probabilities recomputed according bayes theorem segments searched lost person not located see appendix
because row definition does not receive search assignments will necessarily grow larger poa search proceeds negative information decreases poa various segments within search area
indeed search coordinators advised monitor poa rest world particularly respect decisions about expanding search accomplished partialing out new segments formerly outside designated search area
noted heth cornell process developing search plan resembles interlocking cognitive efforts contributed members navigation crew u s navy ship described hutchins his book cognition wild
hutchins applied term distributed cognition describe mutual complementary efforts individual specialists using host cognitive artifacts maps charts electronic instruments computers
similarly fischhoff johnson used term distributed decision-making refer specifically command-and-control type operations decisions made two more individuals
although during search operations numerous artifacts may employed maps software statistical data lost person behavior profiles emphasis article will subjective probabilities initially assigned search area become starting point subsequent bayesian computations made search proceeds
stated earlier methodology prioritizing search area requires planners make subjective estimates probability each segment search area plus row
assumed judgments based planners' sar experience acquired expertise plus reference actuarial data tabulated previous lost person incidents how far pls various types lost people tend travel before being located
unfortunately much research decision processes would appear cast doubt ability planners make valid probability judgments ability render unbiased assessments probability uncertain events been challenged tversky koehler's support theory
briefly support theory maintains subjective probability judgments based not likelihood events themselves but descriptions events
thus same event may seen more less likely depending manner described those making judgments
example people estimate significantly higher chances dying heart disease cancer other natural causes than simply any natural cause
unpacking effect said occur whenever people asked consider disjoint components uncertain event various possibilities cause event rather than merely event itself
other words more explicitly event described more likely will judged occur
various explanations unpacking been proposed including tendency explicit inclusion specific causes effect increase confidence cause remind people possibilities they might overlooked
side effect unpacking subadditivity
according tversky koehler when people asked make global judgment probability dying unnatural cause they tend base their judgments representative typical case without necessarily delineating example possible types unnatural causes
however unpacking event judged e g homicide fatal accident drowning not only leads higher estimates probability but frequently total probabilities greater than number percent
term subadditivity therefore refers fact probability judgments globally described event less than sum assigned unpacked version event
another important consideration support theory pertains those occasions when people judge relative probabilities two more mutually exclusive hypotheses
example if there three suspects crime b c hypothesis culprit associated probability did termed focal hypothesis while possibility someone other than guilty b c some unknown x called residual hypothesis
case set possibilities-either not-a symbolized x number discrete either hypothesis must necessarily true
support theory each hypothesis under consideration will varying degrees support each depending manner hypothesis described example whether not unpacked
when comparing relative probabilities focal residual hypotheses support former s will decrease estimated probability latter s x number seen formula where pa x number refers probability rather than x number true
bringing discussion back search rescue planning task describe hypothesis missing subject designated search area focal hypothesis while possibility he she somewhere else-the row-as residual hypothesis
typical application poa methodology described earlier using support theory terminology
after some discussion individual planners proceed individually unpack search area into smaller segments all represent separate hypotheses about where subject might finally allocate some probability residual hypothesis person none those segments
at point begin form our own hypotheses why methodology sometimes fails
according hill single most common reason why lost person not found reasonable period time victim had traveled out designated search area search planners had not extended search into row soon enough
similar problem apparently encountered u s coast guard their conduct maritime sar searching missing vessels at sea
described scenario lock said occur when planners become fixated particularscenario exclusion all others
possible if not indeed likely planners emergency situations experiencing unpacking effects tend keep them unreasonably locked their focal hypotheses
other words considering all many possibilities could account missing person vessel at sea any search segments planners estimate consensus poa inflated focal hypothesis target designated search area while underestimated residual hypothesis target somewhere else
even if bayesian procedure used reevaluating poa search proceeds eventual decision reject focal hypothesis start extending search into row delayed detriment lost person's safety
example application bayesian formula applied sar see appendix poa's updated each time segment searched subject not found
each iteration poa row grows slightly larger
