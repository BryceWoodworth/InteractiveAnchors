petersburg paradox famous economic philosophical puzzle generated numerous conflicting explanations
shed empirical light phenomenon examined subjects' bids one st
petersburg gamble real monetary payment
found bids were typically lower than twice smallest payoff thus much lower than generally supposed
also examined bids offered several hypothetical variants st
petersburg paradox
found bids were weakly affected truncating gamble were strongly affected repeats gamble depended linearly initial seed value gamble
one explanation call median heuristic strongly predicts data
subjects following strategy evaluate gamble if they were taking median rather than mean payoff distribution
finally argue distribution outcomes embodied st
petersburg paradox so divergent gaussian form statistical mean poor estimator expected value so expected value st
petersburg gamble undefined
results suggest classic paradox straightforward explanation rooted use statistical heuristic
 introduction 
st
petersburg paradox originally proposed number house offers flip coin until comes up heads
house pays number if heads appears first trial otherwise payoff doubles each time tails appears compounding stopping payment being given at first heads bernoulli number shown figure number
conventional definitions st
petersburg gamble infinite expected value nonetheless most people share intuition they should not offer more than few dollars play
explaining why people offer small sums play gamble infinite expected value important question economics philosophy
st
petersburg paradox attracted explanations many well-known thinkers including daniel niklaus bernoulli cramer de morgan condorcet euler poisson gibbon economists including marschack cournot arrow keynes stigler samuelson von mises ramsey aumann
earliest discussions st
petersburg paradox led idea utility curves now central concept economics
moreover menger's discussion paradox sparked von neumann's interest utility turn influenced von neumann morgenstern's foundational book theory games economic behavior
despite importance st
petersburg paradox there no widely accepted explanation low values most people place theoretically priceless gamble
moreover there precious little empirical data st
petersburg paradox
present study review several major classes explanations then provide empirical data designed test explanations
