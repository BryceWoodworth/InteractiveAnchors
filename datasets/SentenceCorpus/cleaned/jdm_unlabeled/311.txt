 
researchers frequently argue within-subjects designs should avoided because they result research hypotheses transparent subjects study
conjecture was empirically tested replicating several classic between-subjects experiments within-subjects designs
two additional experiments psychology students were given within-subjects versions studies asked guess what researcher was hoping find i e research hypothesis members society judgment decision making sjdm were asked predict how well students would perform task
whole students were unable identify research hypothesis when provided within-subjects version experiments
furthermore sjdm members were largely inaccurate their predictions transparency within-subjects design
 introduction 
field psychology there long-standing controversy over appropriate use between within-subjects designs
within-subjects designs greater power less variability but many researchers eschew their use two reasons
first been argued within-subjects designs render our research hypotheses transparent
within-subjects design subjects will aware purposes our experiment may behave accordingly thus posing threat internal validity experiment
second some argued life more similar between-subjects design
therefore between-subjects designs increase generalizability experimental findings
however others argued between-subjects designs pose their own risks
parducci birnbaum contend particularly subjective judgments between-subjects design should abandoned because results confounding context stimulus
most famous demonstration principle was provided birnbaum who showed between-subjects design subjects rated number number being significantly larger than number
theoretically between-subjects design two conditions identical except manipulation single stimulus
case stimulus manipulated was number being rated number number
however birnbaum argues subjective judgments cannot made isolation they require context
within-subjects design context specified two more conditions compared each other
between-subjects design subjects left construct their own context evaluate stimulus
when case very likely different contexts will invoked different stimuli
example number likely bring mind other single-digit numbers comparison thus leaving impression number relatively large number
contrast number likely bring mind other triple-digit numbers comparison leaving impression number relatively small number
thus between-subjects design both stimuli context vary between conditions confounding results
although relative merits may theoretically debated what more troubling hypotheses tested two designs often do not result same conclusions
example between-subjects comparisons manipulations base rates do not affect judgments probability leading conclusion base rates ignored
however within-subjects comparisons base rates large significant effects judgments probability leading conclusion base rates not ignored
despite concerns about using between-subjects designs evaluate subjective judgments raised birnbaum others appears within-subjects design fallen out favor many areas psychology
particular within judgment decision making there exist many findings supported almost exclusively between-subjects data
examples include hindsight bias research reason-based choice availability support theory many classic demonstrations heuristics biases
researchers areas frequently argued between-subjects designs more appropriate
one main reasons cited superiority between-subjects designs belief within-subjects designs transparent
although appears popular reason rejecting within-subjects design assertion never been empirically tested
thus gap literature inspired two specific aims research
first aim was determine if classic examples between-subjects designs could replicated using within-subjects designs
