cws index coherence criterion looks only at internal properties data without incorporating external standard
experiment number college students n number carried out number  number digit addition multiplication problems under time pressure
experiment number experienced golfers n number also college students putted toward target nine different locations
within each experiment analyzed same responses using different methods
arithmetic tasks accuracy information mean absolute deviation correct answer mad using coherence criterion was available golf accuracy information using correspondence criterion mean deviation target also mad was available
ranked performances participants according each measure then compared orders using spearman's rs
mental calculation cws order correlated moderately rs number mad
however different coherence criterion degree model fit did not correlate either cws accuracy
putting ranking generated cws correlated number generated mad
consensual answers were also available both experiments rankings they generated correlated highly those mad
coherence vs correspondence distinction did not map well onto criteria performance evaluation
 introduction 
evaluate work plumber therapist surgeon necessary assess on-the-job performance
while all professionals their creative moments most fields ability perform practiced task consistently well hallmark expert
performance assessment also key determining whether training program technical innovation worthwhile
ideally assessment objective rather than matter opinion
quantitative assessment performance attends measurable aspects work typically bottom line outcome labor
how many leaks were stopped
how many patients were cured
outcome measures capture what hammond refers correspondence competence they focus directly consequences
outcomes also compared theory-based standards example updating opinions should governed bayes's theorem
hammond refers type standard coherence criterion
two types criteria optimality compare performance gold standard compelling benchmark against measure behavior
indeed some researchers argue performance measured meaningfully only when gold standard been agreed upon
just hammond hoped correspondence-coherence distinction would help clarify debates about proper way evaluate scientific theory paper invoke distinction hope clarifying debates about how assess performance
many professional domains gold standards simply not available
what outcome reflects quality film review grade assigned instructor sentence imposed magistrate
weiss shanteau responded challenge gold standards elusive constructing empirical index referred cws does not incorporate ground truth
they suggested proficiency evaluative skill at its core
whatever task one must attend relevant aspects situation decide what do
viewing evaluation akin what measuring instrument does weiss shanteau identified two necessary properties expert judgment discrimination responding differently different stimuli consistency responding similarly similar stimuli
cws index presented equation number combines two properties ratio format
ratio large when judge discriminates effectively reduced when judge inconsistent
weiss shanteau stressed two properties not conceptually independent
easy enough adopt strategy trades off one property at expense other but achieving both at same time requires accurate evaluation stimuli essence expert judgment number when they originally proposed cws index weiss shanteau were intentionally non-committal about measures discrimination inconsistency
trade-off implied ratio definition heart concept any measures reflect two properties will do
applications generate numerical data including present ones discrimination inconsistency been operationalized using terms familiar analysis variance
experimental design suitable cws analysis may simple presentation each several stimuli more than once
discrimination means different stimuli responded differently
accordingly discrimination captured mean square between stimuli
inconsistency implies given stimulus presented multiple times inspires different responses various occasions
inconsistency captured mean square between replications
cws approach resembles coherence criterion examines purely internal properties behavior
however differs other coherence criteria while proficient performance inexorably generates high values cws there no theory specifying optimal behavior
our view performance ought tied external world experts should follow prescriptive model their task
however not always possible evaluator know best answers applicable model often unknown well
absence optimal answers does not diminish practical importance having capability evaluate members large class professionals who provide opinions about status achievements people
more popular approach evaluating subjective domains compare someone's responses those other people
opinions often converge toward truth
consensual answers often been proposed surrogates correct answers although logic doing so been criticized
gist criticism simply people may agree poor answers
one may view consensus coherence criterion postulating there exists across people common latent structure underlying their opinions
current project employed tasks there were indisputably optimal responses namely mental calculation golf putting
accuracy arithmetic calculation customarily assessed using coherence criterion correct answers dictated logical rules mathematics
accuracy putt usually assessed using correspondence criterion how close ball gets its target
goal present research was shed light cws's ability capture subjective domains examining objective domains
