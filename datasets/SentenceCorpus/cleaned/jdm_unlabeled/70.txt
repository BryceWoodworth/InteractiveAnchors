 
conflict over iran's nuclear program involves us-led policy impose sanctions iran perceived each side preeminent challenge its own national security global peace
yet there little scientific study understanding how material incentives disincentives economic sanctions psychologically affect targeted population potentially influence behaviour
here explore iranian nuclear program within paradigm concerned sacred values
integrate experiments within survey number iranians
find relatively small but politically significant portion iranian population believes acquiring nuclear energy become sacred value sense proposed economic incentives disincentives result backfire effect offers material rewards punishment lead increased anger greater disapproval
pattern was specific nuclear energy did not hold acquiring nuclear weapons
present study first demonstration backfire effect material disincentives well incentives issue whose apparent sacred nature recent rather than longstanding
 introduction 
dealing political conflict two broadly different approaches modeling values drive decisions choice behavior consequentialist approach based instrumental material values deontological approach based moral sacred values
consequentialist approach suggests all decisions ultimately based expected outcomes actions
contrast deontological approach suggests sacred values represent moral imperatives circumscribe certain actions independently all out proportion expected outcomes prospects success act accordance them because they right noble thing do fundamental matters religion
there serious misgivings about explanatory adequacy theories rational choice economics politics
recent work social cognitive psychology suggests sacred values may critically involved important decisions life well sustaining seemingly intractable cultural political conflicts
sacred values svs appear intimately bound up sentiments personal collective identity may privileged links emotions show insensitivity quantity calculations loss versus gain resist material tradeoffs
psychological implication holders sacred values strongly averse using traditional utility-based models reason about values
specifically while secular value easily substituted another value tradeoffs involving svs result strong negative emotions moral outrage
one focus sacred values research been seemingly intractable conflicts deep historical context between israelis palestinians disputes over centuries old sharia law indonesia hindu-muslim clashes over babri mosque india
fierce inter-group conflicts may also arise over issues much narrower history iran's national nuclear program perceived major source challange security each side
nuclear program been repeatedly depicted iranian leadership uncompromisable inalienable right
white house recently acknowledged possibility iran's ideological commitment nuclear weapons they're not making simple cost-benefit analysis issue
preliminary experiment suggested operation svs iran's nuclear program however sample was small most importantly study was ambiguous about whether svs were about acquiring nuclear energy nuclear weapons
previous research study examined only effects material incentives compromise
