 
heuristic decision-making models like take-the-best rely environmental regularities
they conduct limited search ignore available information assuming there structure decision-making environment
take-the-best relies at least two regularities diminishing returns says information found earlier search more important than information found later correlated information says information found early search predictive information found later
develop new approaches determining search orders measuring cue discriminability make reliance take-the-best regularities clear open manipulation
then demonstrate well-studied german cities environment three new city environments when how regularities support take-the-best
do focus not accuracy take-the-best most previous studies but measure its coherence decision-making process
particular consider whether take-the-best decisions based single piece information justified because exhaustive search information unlikely yield different decision
using measure show when two environmental regularities present decisions made limited search unlikely changed after exhaustive search but both regularities often necessary
 introduction 
number olympics was first time professionals us nba league were allowed play men's basketball competition
us dream team filled stars like michael jordan magic johnson larry bird charles barkley patrick ewing was one most dominant teams ever assembled any sporting competition
their closest game was number  number victory final over croatia head coach chuck daly never felt need call timeout during tournament
making predictions about outcomes sporting contests notoriously difficult but dream team made some predictions easy
imagine trying predict whether not us would beat its first opponent tournament angola examining players each team beginning starting five moving bench players
at some point early us list-maybe after jordan johnson bird barkley ewing-there would no need look further
no matter who else was us roster angolan roster outcome already clear
dream team also made predictions easy during course games
about number minutes play first half against angola us led number number
was clear us would win large margin without needing watch rest game
both decisions about us victory non-compensatory because not all available information used so ignored information cannot compensate for-that change decision based on-the information used
remaining player rosters not examined rest game not watched
yet decision forego further information seems sensible both cases
not reaction limited time cognitive resources but recognition nature environment decision-making taking place
