 introduction 
experiments within broad decision making tradition involve subjects making multiple decisions either different partners groups repeated decisions learning task
analyses data typically involve examination how rewards received related characteristics experiment individuals involved
complex multivariate analyses relatively rare
typical analytic approach at least one major drawback
most studies tradition involve multiple decisions each individual
each subject participates several decisions
entirely possible individuals vary their decisions across rounds play they engage
looking at average results decisions could mask important variations patterns within data
aggregated analyses do not allow researcher fully examine ways characteristics participants experimental design affect decisions
other words analyses provide descriptive results but only hints decision-making dynamics within experiments
suggest data experiments fit classic form multi-level nested data sets they usually include multiple decisions actor within one more set conditions
mixed models been specifically developed deal multi-level units observation help us understand process dynamics decision making within our studies
paper describe logic mixed model analyses contrasting them familiar within between subject designs
then demonstrate use models decision making data reanalyzing data two previously published articles
first study involves modification iowa gambling task multiple decisions individual players response variety stimuli second involves prisoner dilemma games conducted within seven person groups
finally briefly describe wide range possible applications advantages approach provide pragmatic advice using hierarchical models encourage their broader use decision making research
although major aim paper illustrate utility method include appendix sas language used our analyses provide greater transparency encourage use method
mixed model one there both between within-subject variables
noted above studies decision research literature often focus exclusively between-subject variables their analyses ignore within-subject variables those affect variations decisions one individual makes
yet variations individuals' decisions often theoretically substantively important
thus argue more natural fruitful parsimonious analyze many decision making studies using mixed model approach
addition mixed models very flexible adapt wide variety experimental designs
pure within-subjects design all subjects serve all treatment conditions
first panel table number illustrates design assuming there two different design elements b
design each subject s participates each condition design element design element b b
example would classic lichtenstein slovic study gamblers las vegas casino showed within-subject preference reversals based response mode bids choices
pure between-subjects design one each subject serves only single condition there no within-subject variation
design illustrated second panel table number where each subject s only one condition two design conditions b
other words pure between subjects design subjects nested within b ab each subject contributes single observation dependent variable thus appears only single treatment condition
many decision making studies use design simplify their data mimic design summarizing across all decisions individual makes form summary score
summary number then used dependent variable
researchers also use design involves repeated measures conditions one more factors presented each subject within-subject variables set rewards neuroimaging study variables gender culture experimental conditions positive negative frames subjects do not share between-subject variables
design frequently referred psychologists mixed design illustrated third part table number b within subjects factor between-subjects factor
term mixed particularly apt there sources variance produced between-subjects differences within-subjects differences both types differences contribute statistical analysis
design allows us assess within-subject differences at same time study between-subject relationships
design also allows us model dependency successive decisions what technically called auto regression tendency individuals behave similar manner one decision another
researchers used mixed models variety settings
much original work mixed models was conducted agricultural settings thus statisticians also refer models split-plot design
agricultural setting plots were often considered random each plot exposed same set fixed experimental conditions one experimental variables while plots were nested within experimental conditions different experimental variable
mixed designs contain at least one within-subject plot variable at least one between-subject plot variable
panel models used economists both between-units often firms component within-units changes over time component
sociologists used hierarchical linear models examine influence characteristics school classrooms entire schools individual student achievement
developmental psychologists educational researchers used models examine growth curves changes individuals' achievement developmental characteristics within-subject variable students varying different characteristics between-subject analysis
thus there wide variety analytical methods pay close attention within between individual group variables
two widely used general modeling strategies hierarchical linear models mixed models
either allows modeling random variation individuals decisions nested within individuals
situations analyzed paper either hierarchical linear modeling mixed modeling approach used
suggest general logic approach applied issues facing experimenters studying decision making help researchers develop more accurate understanding elements decision making process lead hypothesized outcomes
within many experiments given individual makes numerous choices often across variety experimental settings
because individuals make multiple decisions decisions not statistically independent
usual method handling data simply aggregate all decisions level individual ignore any intra-individual variation
practice however ignores potential variation limits extent researchers assess impact experimental variables individual choice
also encourages researchers conduct numerous separate bivariate analyses
use mixed models provide both more inclusive yet more parsimonious efficient method analysis
now illustrate utility models reanalyzing data two different studies
