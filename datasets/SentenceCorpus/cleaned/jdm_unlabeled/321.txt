 
long known problem preferential publication statistically significant results publication bias may lead incorrect estimates true effects being investigated
even though other research areas e g medicine biology aware problem identified strong publication biases researchers judgment decision making jdm largely ignore
reanalyzed two current meta-analyses area
both showed evidence publication biases may led substantial overestimation true effects they investigated
review additional jdm meta-analyses shows most meta-analyses conducted no insufficient analyses publication bias
however given our results rareness non-significant effects literature suspect biases occur quite often
findings suggest conclusions based meta-analyses without reported tests publication bias should interpreted caution b publication policies standard research practices should revised overcome problem
 introduction 
comparison statistically non-significant results larger proportion significant results overestimate underlying population effect
long known repeatedly discussed problem preferential publication significant studies will therefore lead literature provides false impression regarding robustness size effect question
when non-significant results largely completely excluded publication even non-existing effects may appear substantial
strong direct evidence overrepresentation significant results scientific literature originates primarily area medicine where several representative samples all studies investigating specific research question become available
samples consist studies registered drug licensing agencies funding agencies institutional review boards
several surveys compared results registered studies data were eventually published
recent particularly impressive example survey turner et al
data base survey consists number clinical trials effect antidepressant agents were registered food drug administration fda united states
according fda number studies reported statistically significant primary results
thirty-seven studies were eventually published
contrast number studies reporting non-significant main results number remained unpublished
additional number studies appeared scientific journals but reported-in contradiction fda records-significant main outcomes studies dependent variables considered most relevant were exchanged
combined effect size registered studies was g number
published literature however combined effect size was inflated g number
field psychology surveys nature rare individual studies their results particular seldom documented systematic fashion
however one survey did employ similar procedure assess publication biases
data base consisted all studies were approved department psychology human subjects committee at u s university between number number
approximately number percent studies reporting significant results were published
studies non-significant outcomes however only number percent were submitted publication
thus there strong evidence supporting conclusion publication biases affect scientific literature several disciplines including psychology
even though omnipresence null hypothesis significance tests may less pronounced area jdm than elsewhere psychology still widely used procedure
rarity non-significant results give good reason assume publication biases do occur
thus main question pursue article whether there evidence inflated estimates effect sizes jdm literature caused biases
generally publication biases pose threat validity body scientific knowledge represented literature
however absence registered studies may serve standard comparison problem may only become apparent when study results collected systematic quantitative review
any summary review extant literature including meta-analyses will inevitably produce incorrect estimate true effect if available information represents selective sample relevant research area
at same time meta-analyses provide opportunity gauge extent problem
several methods been developed aim assess whether collection effect sizes affected publication bias
areas human medicine biology several examples serious publication biases been identified using methods reanalyze published data
however jdm psychology whole problem been largely ignored
following will first provide brief overview methods detection publication biases
then will use methods reanalyze some detail one meta-analysis area jdm
