 
although theories economics evolutionary biology predict one's age health survival probability should associated one's subjective discount rate sdr few studies empirically tested links
our study analyzes detail how sdr related age health survival probability surveying sample individuals townships around durban south africa
contrast previous studies find age not significantly related sdr but both physical health survival expectations u-shaped relationship sdr
individuals very poor health high discount rates those very good health also high discount rates
similarly those expected survival probability extremes high discount rates
therefore health survival probability not age seem predictors one's sdr area world high morbidity mortality
 introduction 
people generally prefer receive reward sooner rather than later
present value future reward often discounted when there delay receiving reward
many terms used describe phenomenon time preference positive rate intertemporal substitution impatience impulsivity
delay discounting will used paper refer phenomenon individual discounts value reward received future relative receiving reward immediately degree individual discounts future reward will measured subjective discount rate sdr define formally below
although delay discounting common assumption models intertemporal choice literature relatively incomplete when comes why people discount future general why some people discount more than others
among various factors associated delay discounting proposed literature review detail next section theory background age emerged one key factor
although existing theoretical models delay discounting often explicitly specify mortality risk reduces opportunity consumption future morbidity risk reduces utility consumption future determinants delay discounting most existing empirical tests theoretical models rely mostly age proxy those risks
distinction between age mortality morbidity may important
if determinants sdr known if determinants changed many potentially bad outcomes related impatience could theory prevented if willingness wait some future reward could enhanced
while one's age not changeable one's mortality morbidity risks changed either through investment one's own health capital through public health interventions
if mortality morbidity risks causally related one's sdr changes risks potentially lead changes one's sdr
our study complements existing literature adding health survival probability  addition age  empirical specifications
