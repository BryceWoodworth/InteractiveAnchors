 
indecisiveness individual difference measure chronic difficulty delay decision making
indecisiveness associated low decisional confidence distinct patterns pre-choice information search behavior
present study explored whether confidence levels search behaviors associated individual indecisiveness also emerge group decision making contexts
study number decisive indecisive participants were assigned make decision individually homogenous three-person group
indecisiveness score was found predict participant decisional confidence individual condition but not group condition group participants being overall more confident than individuals
similar results were obtained other related measures participants' perceptions decision task
surprisingly no indecisiveness-related differences information search were found suggesting other aspects group process contribute increased confidence
results provide initial evidence indecisiveness does not influence group decision making especially indecisive individuals working groups may way boost decisional confidence
 introduction 
indecisiveness individual difference measure associated chronic difficulty delay decision making
self-report descriptors include taking long time decide not knowing how decide feeling uncertain during decision making avoiding decisions changing ones mind regretting decisions
given tendencies indecisive individuals appear poorly adapted many tasks important goal identify circumstances indecisiveness likely compromise effective decision making
present research motivated question whether relationship between indecisiveness patterns decision making informational search contexts observed individuals extends groups
introduction first review past empirical work establishing relationship between indecisiveness decisional confidence informational search patterns
then motivate our interest exploring relationships group decision making context integrate relevant group literature
finally present empirical study relationship between indecisiveness patterns decision making individuals versus small groups
