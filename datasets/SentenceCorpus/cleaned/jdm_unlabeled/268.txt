 
one major challenge behavioral decision research identify cognitive processes underlying judgment decision making
glockner argued compared previous methods process models more efficiently tested simultaneously analyzing choices decision times confidence judgments
multiple-measure maximum likelihood mm-ml strategy classification method was developed purpose implemented ready-to-use routine stata commercial package statistical data analysis
present article describe implementation mm-ml r free package data analysis under gnu general public license provide practical guide application
also provide mm-ml easy-to-use r function
thus prior knowledge r programming not necessary those interested using mm-ml
 introduction 
been repeatedly argued individuals make adaptive use different decision strategies application respective strategy might depend different factors participants' characteristics effort accuracy trade-offs learning experiences presentation format situational forces
some strategies might entirely based deliberate computations
others contrast might partially rely automatic-intuitive processes
glockner betsch showed classic process tracing methods mouselab might hinder information search processes necessary applying automatic processes
furthermore taking into account intuitive-automatic processes many strategies make essentially same choice predictions
glockner showed considering strategies make different choice predictions people more efficiently classified applying multiple-measure maximum likelihood strategy classification method mm-ml compared relying choice-based strategy classification alone
furthermore mm-ml method also allows us differentiate between strategies make same choice predictions given decision time predictions aid discrimination
preparing experiment generate data application mm-ml method comprises three basic steps number choose dependent measures specify distributions those measures number choose set strategies number select items differentiate between considered strategies derive predictions dependent measures
then fit predictions strategies individuals' empirical data calculated using mm-ml strategy most likely accounting individuals' behavior identified
glockner provided implementation mm-ml method stata  commercial package data analysis
