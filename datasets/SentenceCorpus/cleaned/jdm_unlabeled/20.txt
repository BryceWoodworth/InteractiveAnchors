hybrid ecology relationships among correspondence coherence strategies goals cognitive tactics continuum intuition analysis become critically important
intuitive tactics used achieve correspondence physical world do not work electronic world
rather i make case judgment decision making hybrid ecology requires coherence primary strategy achieve correspondence process requires shift tactics intuition toward analysis
 introduction 
live correspondence-driven world actual state world imposes constraints interactions within
correspondence-driven domains judgments  how far away how high obstacle
what correct diagnosis given symptoms
where enemy force likely attack
 guided multiple probabilistic fallible indicators physical world
survival depends correspondence accuracy our judgment how well corresponds objective reality
increasing availability sophisticated technological systems however profoundly altered character many correspondence-driven environments aviation medicine military operations nuclear power well processes judgments decision making within them
paper i trace evolution aircraft cockpit example transformation probabilistic environment into ecological hybrid environment characterized both probabilistic deterministic features elements
technology changed nature cues information available pilot also changed strategies tactics pilots must use make judgments successfully
i make case judgment decision making hybrid ecology requires coherence primary strategy achieve correspondence process requires shift tactics intuition toward analysis
recognition changes carries implications research models high-technology environments well design systems decision aids
