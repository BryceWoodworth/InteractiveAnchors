 introduction 
perhaps one most well-established behavioral decision making effects effect default options choice
people choose options presented defaults more often than they otherwise would even important decisions would seem require careful thought choosing health care retirement plans
but under umbrella default bias several different effects all point direction choosing default
mere inattention could lead some decision makers retain default if action required only when opting out default
loss-averse decision makers may not want give up default because feels like loss more painful than gaining different option pleasurable
fact someone set option default create information leakage people might infer normative reasons choosing default
finally people may choose defaults when there sufficient transaction costs money time choosing alternative
examine effect default options choices call default pull
default pull effect default options decision makers' uncertainty about their own preferences
when deciding what one likes argue even subtle defaults help shape what decision maker prefers causing her consider whether she prefers default
process provides link between how defaults influence choices how anchors influence judgments
way default pull effect kind constructed preference wherein manner preference elicited influences what one's preferences
unlike many findings people stick default show default pull sometimes involves choosing default sometimes involves choosing something different what one otherwise would presence default but not default itself
study default pull use motivated experimental choice strips away many common reasons why defaults might work modified presentation dictator game whatever option top list allocations left selected computer interface ostensibly unintentionally see figure number
subtle default option substantially affects players' choices different defaults change average amount given number percent total endowment
design results our experiment allow us rule out inattention loss aversion information leakage transaction costs explanations effect default
before describe specifics task briefly review literature default biases then formally define default pull
