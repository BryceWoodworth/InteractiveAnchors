experimental study demonstrate if people receive feedback over outcomes they obtained factual outcomes outcomes they would obtained had they decided differently counterfactual outcomes they become regret-averse subsequent decisions
effect not only observed when feedback evoked regret counterfactual outcomes being higher than factual outcomes but even when feedback evoked no regret factual outcomes being equal counterfactual outcomes
findings suggest effect subsequent decisions at least partly due transfer comparison mind-set triggered prior choice
 introduction 
regret negative experience most us would want avoid
stems comparing obtained decision outcome outcomes might been had one chosen differently
research regret consistently shown anticipation regret motivation avoid regret drives many our decisions
although literature regret distinguishes between experienced regret anticipated regret does acknowledge connection between two sense experience current regret may affect anticipation future regret
agreement notion creyer ross found experienced regret bidding subsequently led more risk averse biddings
more specifically led people subsequently prefer high probability low payoff options over low probability high payoff options
also context consumer decision making cooke et al showed experienced regret over first decision influenced subsequent purchase decisions
similar vein zeelenberg pieters showed experienced regret led consumers switch different product
studies effect experienced regret subsequent decisions was domain-specific sense example regret purchasing specific product was found affect subsequent purchases same similar product
more recently however raeva mittone schwarzbach found effects experienced regret might broader scope even extend decisions other domains
their study regret over risky decision affected subsequent decisions intertemporal choice setting
after playing gamble participants who learned they could obtained higher outcomes had they decided differently i e had they played another gamble showed stronger time preference
time preference does not refer comparison between factual counterfactual outcomes not related traditional gamble paradigm thus pertains different domain than one participants experienced regret
so how should explain findings
domain-specific effects experienced regret subsequent choice most straightforward explanation would after experience regret decision-makers merely learn they should not repeat their mistake thus change their behavior i e once bitten twice shy
would consistent most models emotion regulation more specifically regret regulation
broader effects experienced regret however explanation terms learning may not suffice
after all after experiencing regret risky setting does not directly follow one avoid making same mistake showing strong time preference
note however even non-domain specific effects regret one could envisage carry-over process assuming not specific decision-related regret carries over subsequent decisions but rather more unspecified nature regret carries over
experience regret may sensitize decision makers future experiences regret increase their motivation avoid anticipated regret
rather than concluding they do not want make same mistake twice decision makers may reason they do not want experience same negative emotion twice
explanation was favored raeva et al
do not want dispute regret-specific explanations been put forward previous research
however do want draw attention additional yet unexplored more general process may result experience regret experience regret may lead carry-over comparative mind-set
one defining characteristics regret emotion results comparing what what could been
when obtained outcomes what after making choice compare unfavorable outcomes one could obtained decision-makers will experience regret
comparing decision outcomes therefore essential experience regret if you don't compare you don't regret
current paper draw attention consequences making comparison
particular suggest mere fact making comparative judgments about decision outcomes may already elicit comparative mind-set mind-set may carry-over subsequent decisions
xu wyer recently demonstrated carry-over effect series studies purchase decisions
example one their experiments they presented participants opportunity buy one out four types products chocolate bars potato chips chewing gum pens
choose buy one products one needs compare products
consistent their comparative mind-set idea participants' willingness purchase one products increased if previously they had completed task requiring them compare animals each other e g comparing elephants hippos
other words evoked comparative mind-set animals task carried over product purchase task
more general terms xu wyer p number described carry-over comparative mind-set once activated persist influence behaviors decisions other situations comparison processes might come into play
agreement insights here suggest experience regret critically dependent comparison what what could been may evoke comparative mind-set comparative mind-set persists influence subsequent decision-making
investigate possibility designed experiment participants made two successive decisions
first presented participants decision task they would would not experience regret
subsequently presented them different task matching task they had match two options terms attractiveness
induce regret first task participants were presented situation they obtained low outcomes learned they would obtained higher outcomes had they chosen differently
investigate idea that-at least part of-the effects induction regret may attributed invoked comparative mind-set also included several alternative inductions
some presented our participants same low outcomes but did not inform them outcomes they could obtained had they chosen differently
conditions participants thus obtained low outcomes but could not compare their outcomes what could been
absence comparison decision outcomes people could therefore not regret their decision
consistent bell who argued key identification regret factor decision making under uncertainty hypothesis may matter whether foregone lottery resolved not
predicted phenomenon experimentation should concentrated
indeed studies followed up advice found decision makers most likely anticipate regret when expecting feedback
another condition however did inform participants about outcome they would obtained had they chosen differently but told them outcome would yielded exactly same outcome
note condition crucial because condition too participants would experience no regret but no-regret would now result similar comparison process case conclusion there nothing regret also results comparison what what could been
experimental setup allowed us investigate plausibility our general comparative mind-set explanation versus more specific explanations learning regret sensitivity explanations put forward prior research
if effects experienced regret subsequent decisions would primarily result carry-over specific experience regret should find effects would observed only condition induced regret
