measure attachment land israel developed administered two groups jewish college students israel united states
levels land attachment high not significantly different two groups great deal variation
land may become more important through being inhabited group over centuries
positive contagion effect opposed some cases negative contagion produced when enemies live land some period time
demonstrate significant correlation positive contagion sensitivity attachment land israel
unlike many other cases interaction positive negative contagion negative contagion does not overwhelm positive contagion domain land attachment
also present evidence linkages between political positions religiosity importance israel arab aversion vulnerability israel attachment land but do not fully account contagion effects
number significant differences between israelis americans described
 introduction 
people often care deeply about their personal land example land their family owned lived decades centuries
may linked through evolution territorial defense
but people also seem care about land relevant their group rather than their own person family
land attachment may considered two distinct ways attachment place specific locations particular historical significance attachment space more type attachment larger parcel land some sociopolitical significance land defined borders country
place attachment sacred land probably history thousands years whereas attachment land space much more recent
national land newest aspect land since nations states relatively new inventions human history
nations states developed borders came define territories were defended expanded
personal land attachment system may been extended sacred land later national land process cultural preadaptation
land often thought untradable would not case if was just source resources
french word terroir captures broader perspective refers land including its human capital cultural history
none strong attachments been systematically studied psychologists
land plays central role many current political ethnopolitical conflicts including northern ireland iraq taiwan palestine israel sri lanka
states very rarely give up land voluntarily even if land inhabited people who despised despise host country
fact emphasized lustick he explores three very few cases country voluntarily gave up land number century
concept protected values relevant land attachment
protected values those unfungible values entities people resist trading anything
morally offensive at least some people even consider exchanging one's children one's religion one's land potential exchanges also been described taboo tradeoffs involving sacred values
land may also considered part person's nation's extended self hence particularly close relation person nation
finally land perhaps most important manifestation symbolic value property reinforcing group identity
exploratory study develop measure attachment national land space sacred land place context attachment land israel israeli american jews
developed measure came realize space place distinction may difficult instantiate differentiate
although believe worth attention one analyzes relationships land present study employed single composite measurement attachment land israel
focus paper addition measuring degree attachment land individual cultural differences variable explore one interesting potential determinant land attachment contagion beliefs
contagion beliefs based sympathetic magical law contagion once contact always contact
when two objects physical contact they pass essences between them basic properties each embedded other
process originally believed present only minds people traditional cultures now recognized universal part adult thinking
contagion effects typically permanent accomplished minimal physical contact
transfer essence psychologically characterizes contagion effects mentally represented at least two ways
one conception essence material eliminated physical processes
other essence spiritual resistant erasure physical processes
negative contagion much more common more potent than positive contagion
many people do not show positive contagion whereas everyone shows negative contagion
furthermore individuals who experience both combination two e g food touched cockroach one's favorite personal memento sweater worn adolph hitler mother teresa almost invariably results strong negative outcome
when group lived died particular area land years decades centuries one imagine their essence passed into land
could form base land attachment based positive contagion
other hand if one's land was occupied enemy some period time if was conquered enemy there could strong negative contagion effect
appears land may one rare cases where positive contagion may trump negative contagion at least there many examples world groups very attached land they think was once theirs but been occupied enemy centuries
study explore relation between attachment land israel measures contagion
also consider some other aspects land attachment including its relationship political views about israel religiosity personal importance israel aversion arabs views vulnerability israel attachment personal land
examine attachment land israel jewish college students both israel united states
there been important studies land disputes israel-palestine particularly perspective history political science intergroup attitudes acceptable unacceptable tradeoffs
land central particular conflict both sides considering land theirs
many cases contested land predominantly populated members opposing group
issues claim over sacred land  sites biblical historical significance temple mount  come into conflict well
personal land attachment also relevant confounded national land attachment israel-palestine
customary palestinians who were displaced wear key their former homes order remember their specific villages land they lived
there evidence many arabs jews national land particular sites israel constitute sacred hence protected values
although american jews do not live israel part jewish diaspora they often strong feelings about land israel
major force support israel functioning like many other diaspora understanding degree nature type land attachment relevance understanding ethnopolitical conflict
