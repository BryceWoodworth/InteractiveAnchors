 
when making decisions involve tradeoffs between quality timing desirable outcomes people consistently discount value future outcomes
puzzling finding regarding decisions extremely high rate at people discount future monetary outcomes
most economists would argue decision-makers should turn down only rates return lower than those available them elsewhere
yet vast majority studies find discount rates significantly higher than market interest rates
here ask whether lack knowledge about normative strategy explain high discount rates
initial experiment nearly half subjects did not spontaneously cite elements normative strategy when asked how people should make intertemporal monetary decisions
two follow-up experiments after subjects read financial guide detailing normative strategy discount rates declined up number percent but were still higher than market interest rates
decline persisted though attenuated at least one month
final experiment peer-generated advice influenced discount rates similar manner expert advice arguments focusing normative considerations were at least effective others
studies show part explanation high discount rates lack knowledge regarding normative strategy they quantify how much discount rates reduced response normative arguments
given high level discounting remains however there other contributing factors high discount rates remain quantified
