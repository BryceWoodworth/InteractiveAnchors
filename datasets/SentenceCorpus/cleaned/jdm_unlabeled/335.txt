present two studies predictive power recognition forecasting soccer games analyze previously published results
performance collective recognition heuristic compared two benchmarks predictions based official rankings aggregated betting odds
across three soccer two tennis tournaments predictions based recognition performed similar those based rankings when compared betting odds heuristic fared reasonably well
forecasts based rankings-but not betting odds-were improved incorporating collective recognition information
discuss use recognition forecasting sports conclude aggregating across individual ignorance spawns collective wisdom
 introduction 
thousands bookmakers accepting wagers sporting events around world today betting sports more popular than ever before
example number bettors uk alone wagered number million british pounds soccer games-placing over number million bets total
how should bettors bookmakers make forecasts about sporting events
many different approaches been proposed
one common denominator muster plenty knowledge-ranging various indicators strength individual players teams information about past outcomes wins losses-and then predict game scores e g number number game outcomes based knowledge
knowledge about teams players seems indispensable rendering accurate forecasts-statistically informally
indeed seems absurd assume one successfully predict tennis player will win match if one does not even know most names his her competitors tournament
one
surprisingly there mounting evidence contrary thomas carlyle's intuition collective wisdom individual ignorance genuinely exists
instance recent study ranks tennis players performing wimbledon number tournament-based how often they were recognized number amateur tennis players-predicted match winners better than atp entry ranking
wisdom ignorant crowds one among several examples sports surprising predictive power simple heuristics forgo exploitation ample amounts knowledge
fact simple forecasting mechanisms compete even outperform more sophisticated ones no means new insight
finding however been repeatedly met resistance not widely put use not yet made into popular textbooks example econometrics see hogarth press
one reason may intuitive appeal accuracy-effort trade-off less information computation time one uses less accurate one's judgments will
trade-off believed one few general laws human mind violations law seen odd exceptions
domain forecasting sports events indeed difficult judge what simple forecasting strategies outperform more complex ones simply because dearth data
recent review goldstein gigerenzer noted there need test relative performance heuristics experts complex forecasting methods more systematically over years rather than few arbitrary championships p number
focusing predictive power collective recognition ignorance sports paper contributes literature four ways
first presents two new studies predictive power recognition forecasting soccer games
two studies will show what extent previous results replicated
second compares predictive power recognition two studies previously published research against two benchmarks all tournaments predictions based official rankings e g fifa soccer aggregated betting odds
third investigate whether forecasts based rankings betting odds improved incorporating collective recognition information
fourth investigate performance recognition-based heuristic relies recognition individual names rather than category names e g names soccer players instead names soccer team itself
last but not least let us emphasize our investigation collective recognition domain sports should not taken mean power collective recognition restricted domain
