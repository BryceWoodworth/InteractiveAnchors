 
prior research found mixed evidence long-theorized link between religiosity pro-social behavior
help overcome divergence i hypothesize pro-social behavior linked not religiosity per se but rather salience religion religious norms
i report field experiment examined when auction participants will respond appeal continue bidding secular charitable causes
religious individuals more likely than non-religious individuals respond appeal charity only days they visit their place worship other days week religiosity no effect
notably result persists after controlling host factors may influence bidding but disappears when appeal charity replaced appeal bid other i e competitive reasons
implications link between religion pro-social behavior discussed
 introduction 
psychologists sociologists anthropologists religious scholars long posited link between religiosity defined degree one involved religious activities e g prayer church attendance etc
pro-social behavior e g charitable giving altruism cooperation helping volunteering
consistent empirical investigations repeatedly demonstrated religiosity key predictor self-reported pro-social behavior
however when actual behavior rather than self-reporting studied link between religiosity pro-social behavior disappears becomes extremely tenuous
because self-reports more likely than spontaneous behaviors reflect social desirability bias some argued religiosity less linked actual pro-social behaviors than desire seen others see oneself pro-social
paper considers alternative relationship between religiosity pro-social behavior one may help explain discrepancy
i hypothesize pro-social behavior linked not religiosity per se but rather salience religion religious norms
because religious people more likely situations where religion salient e g prayer at church etc
they may fact exhibit greater propensity behave pro-socially recall doing so self-report surveys
however heightened tendency towards pro-social behavior will not necessarily extend contexts religion not salient case when behaviors studied laboratory experiments
testing hypothesis current investigation sets aside oft-debated question does religion make people nicer
instead asks when does religion make people nicer
i report field experiment assesses whether when religious vs non-religious auction participants respond appeal continue bidding non-religious charitable causes
findings suggest religious individuals more likely respond appeal charity but effect isolated days they likely attended their place worship
prior research link between religion pro-social behavior insufficiently considered role environmental cues play motivating behavior
environmental cues non-conscious effects behavior social well private domains
furthermore stable individual characteristics e g ideological beliefs often fail accurately predict behavior unless task environment contains cues will trigger appropriate behavioral norms
example berger et al find voters more likely support education initiative if their polling location environmental cue happens school vs some other location effect persists even after controlling voter's political views demographic traits host other factors
findings implicate significant role context plays making behavioral norms salient
more specifically research priming effects demonstrates environmental cues activate relevant constructs memory  make them more accessible
activation also spread related constructs turn guide judgment behavior
berger fitzsimons example show increased exposure images dogs lead increased activation accessibility related category cats more positive evaluations puma brand sneakers
likewise hertel kerr show when there ambiguity regarding appropriate decision e g whether favor one's in-group people will rely normative scripts guidance more accessible norms more likely retrieved influence decision making
current context i hypothesize link if any between religiosity pro-social behaviors found contextually triggered salience religious norms
entirely consistent thesis individuals been shown behave more cooperatively when they been unconsciously primed words associated god religion
there also evidence suggest those who intrinsically religious e g those who pray frequently  but not those who extrinsically religious e g those who religious social political reasons  tend more pro-social secular aspects life
findings suggest pro-social behavior may associated less religiosity i e degree one religious than extent religion salient at particular time e g due recent impending trip church
when couple fact religious people more likely than non-religious people situations where religion salient e g prayer at church temple etc
may help explain why self-reported pro-social behavior higher religious people
current investigation presents experimental methodology able separate religiosity viewed stable individual characteristic religious salience triggered contextual cues natural field setting allows us test whether factors predict actual pro-social behavior
