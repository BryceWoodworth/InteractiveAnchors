here use them model patterns information search stopping deciding simulated binary comparison judgment task
simulation involves number subjects making number forced choice comparisons about relative magnitudes two objects two german cities more inhabitants
two worked-examples show how hierarchical models developed account explain diversity both search stopping rules seen across simulated individuals
discuss how results provide insight into current debates literature heuristic decision making argue they demonstrate power flexibility hierarchical bayesian methods modeling human decision-making
 introduction 
cognitive scientist individual differences behavior both intriguing annoying
all familiar subjects our experiments who don't do what they supposed do
sometimes different patterns behavior simply noise subject was cell phone during experiment but often they due legitimate responses our theories models failed anticipate cannot explain
field judgment decision making no exception challenge individual differences
brighton gigerenzer mention passing even theory important influential prospect theory typically predicts only number percent  number percent decisions two-alternative choice tasks many models do much worse
how should field treat individual differences challenges they present our models theories
one emerging approach tackling issues use hierarchical bayesian methods extend existing models apply them principled ways experimental observational data
approach not only provide tools interpreting individual differences but also facilitates theory building providing model-based account why individual differences might arise
think especially interesting important promising approach because deals fully developed models cognition without constraints theoretical assumptions used develop models
taking existing successful models cognition embedding them within hierarchical bayesian framework opens vista potential extensions improvements current modeling because provides capability model rich structure cognition complicated settings
demonstrate application hierarchical bayesian methods modeling heuristic decision-making use standard experimental setup requires subjects make judgments about relative magnitudes two objects size distance fame profitability so
perform judgments often assumed subjects search their memory external sources information cues help differentiate objects
example inference about relative size two cities might facilitated cues indicating two cities capital airport university so
judgments then determined rules use presence absence cues provide estimates desired criterion i e number inhabitants
tasks although apparently simple incorporate several important features need specification theories models wish describe how subjects perform them
paper present two simple case studies first focuses information search second focuses stopping rules
