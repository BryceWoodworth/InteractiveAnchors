 
statement conveys greater risk number people die cancer every day number number people die cancer every year
statistics where both frequencies temporal information used convey risk two theories predict opposite answers question
construal level theory predicts number people die cancer every day will judged more risky while ratio bias predicts equivalent number number people die cancer every year will result higher risk judgments
experiment investigated format produces higher risk ratings whether ratings influenced increasing salience numerical temporal part statistic
forty-eight participants were randomly assigned numerical temporal control salience condition rated risk framed number deaths per day per year
year format was found result higher perceived risk indicating ratio bias effect dominant but there was no effect salience
 introduction 
perception risk important area research not only understanding cognitive processes but also its practical applications conveying risk information public
health domain perceived risk generally regarded first step models health behaviour necessary but not sufficient condition behaviour change see weinstein van der pligt reviews
although other factors been shown mediate relationship conveying sense risk major focus health communication aim influencing individual judgment decision making
present research investigates how risk perception affected framing incidence rates often used convey risk information public
