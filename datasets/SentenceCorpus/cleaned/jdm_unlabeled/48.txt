 introduction 
paper compares compensatory non-conpensatory models descriptions how decisions made real-life settings experienced practitioners
study concerns traffic judges punishment they mete out alleged offenders brought their court
judges traffic courts professional decision makers
their decisions them routine they handle dozens cases every month
defendants appearing court decisions significant involving sometimes hefty fines driving license suspension even prison
asked how many elements traffic judges consider how complex their decision patterns
study relying actual cases professional decision-making contributes debate about plausibilitiy fast frugal heuristics psychological models cognition
there extensive literature how decision makers proceed when they rely multiple cues come decision
many researchers maintain decisions makers do not rely all information available combine any sophisticated way
instead claimed they rely simple heuristics sometimes turn out surprisingly efficient valid more complex approaches favored rational analysis
paper analyzes attempts model decisions made real life experienced traffic judges
how simple how complex judgments meted out
do traffic judges consider all elements case
what extent do they integrate all information available them
there at least two causes superficial treatment available information
first cognitive limitation
people do not use optimal approach because proper integration all information available beyond their mental powers
all humans limited cognitive abilities fundamental difficulty exacerbated conditions under traffic court judges work
their workload high only few minutes available case each characterized some twenty parameters
strategy selection contingent task demands
time pressure specifically time available per variable been shown affect decision making resulting fewer variables being considered replacement complex cognitive strategies simpler ones processing hundreds cases month after month traffic court judges acquire vast experience
there therefore reason expect their decisions settle into some pattern
however second factor they do not benefit feedback important consequences
feedback appropriateness one's decisions been shown essential developing good strategies
particular while interactions often ignored multivariable decisions not case when decision makers habitual access feedback their decisions care greatly about outcome
even if judges knew what happened offenders they sentenced they lack clear criterion evaluate quality their decision
judges little incentive develop complex decision rules
yet they surely do not render random judgments
instead accuracy they may strive adequate judgment one they consider appropriate circumstances expresses their attitudes about each case
yet even if criterion adequacy replaces accuracy unlikely judges attempt reach best possible decision every case
since their task routine each case must quickly dispatched lest backlog increase plausible they do not invest much care judges higher courts where stakes arehigher acquaintance offender protracted
they may also use methods less well thought out than if resources were unlimited motivation high information complete
