 introduction 
recent studies identified following peculiar effect individuals willing pay significantly less binary lottery offers either number number gift certificate equal probability than they number gift certificate alone
uncertainty effect ue not only counterintuitive also presents important challenge current theories risk-aversion arrive at risk-aversion indirectly through shape utility function predict risky prospects should valued no lower than value their worst possible outcome
indeed although disutility gambling been alluded literature generally been avoided formal models because implies unpalatable patterns violation internality
first paper demonstrate ue did so across number different contexts both hypothetical real suggesting effect does not arise incidental features particular paradigm
specifically ue was replicated non-monetary outcomes e g number minutes one willing work boring task studies using choice rather than willingness pay wtp e g number sure vs number number lottery offering either number number gift certificate real world situations actual goods
ruling out number plausible alternative explanations authors interpret ue resulting direct risk-aversion mechanism posits uncertainty per se directly decreases utility risky prospects
other words mere uncertainty about outcome one will receive makes lottery less valuable
support direct risk-aversion mechanism simonsohn built original finding gneezy et al ruling out two additional alternative explanations ue
first simonsohn found ue was observed even when participants certainty condition number sure were aware better outcome number rules out possibility mere awareness better outcome may devalue worse one
second he demonstrated majority participants understood instructions ue was not caused few who did not rules out possibility effect observed simply because participants misunderstand task
basis simonsohn similarly concluded aversion uncertainty per se i e direct risk-aversion likely responsible ue
there however at least two remaining alternative explanations ue been unaddressed previous research
first involves disappointment aversion people may value lotteries less because potential disappointment inherent not receiving better two outcomes
example number won lottery may seem worse than number guaranteed because individual knows they did not receive number
thus ue may result discrepancy values between better worse outcomes rather than uncertainty lottery itself
alternative explanation distinguished experimentally direct risk-aversion mechanism manipulating value better outcome
according bell's loomes sugden's models disappointment amount disappointment should zero when both outcomes equivalent increase monotonically their difference
consequently if ue driven anticipated disappointment inherent not receiving better two outcomes effect should eliminated at least attenuated when lottery outcomes equivalent their perceived value e g lottery one two bookstore gift certificates each worth number
if however ue arises solely mere uncertainty about outcome one will receive then effect should persist despite equivalent values
alternative was examined experiment number
second plausible explanation ue may participants willing pay less lottery because they just general aversion term lottery
might case because some people consider activities immoral against their beliefs
moreover lotteries state lotto typically low-probability gambles expected value less than price entry into lottery
result participants may suspicious term lottery because real world offers typically signal prospects negative expected value
