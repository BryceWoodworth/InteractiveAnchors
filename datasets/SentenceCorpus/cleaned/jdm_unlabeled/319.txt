 
currently disparity exists between process-level models decision researchers use describe predict decision behavior methods implemented metrics collected test models
current work seeks remedy disparity combining advantages work decision research mouse-tracing paradigms contingent information display cognitive psychology eye-tracking paradigms reading scene perception
particular introduce new decision moving-window paradigm presents stimulus information contingent eye fixations
provide data first application method risky decision making show how compares basic eye-tracking mouse-tracing methods
also enumerate practical theoretical analytic advantages method offers above beyond both mouse-tracing occlusion basic eye tracking information without occlusion
include use new metrics offer more precision than those typically calculated mouse-tracing data well those not possible feasible within mouse-tracing paradigm
 introduction 
decision researchers must often rely outcome measures i e choice preference etc
infer how decisions made individuals
advent increased computing power availability usability allowed decision researchers develop methods examine underlying processes attention information acquisition deliberation etc
rather than relying solely observable outcomes
process-tracing paradigms information boards mouse-tracing methods eye-tracking methods verbal protocols been utilized decision research mechanisms capturing decision process
need verify theoretical advances specify how i e process addition what i e outcome produced great interest tracing methods
