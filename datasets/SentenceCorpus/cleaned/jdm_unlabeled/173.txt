 
mere exposure familiarity effect tendency people feel more positive about stimuli they previously been exposed
eurovision song contest two-stage event some contestants final will more familiar viewers than others
thus viewers' voting likely influenced effect
previous work attempting demonstrate effect context been unable control contestant quality
current study used novel procedure analyse way contestant countries distributed their points function how viewers voted those countries between number number showed contestants did better if they previously appeared semifinal was seen voters
evidence mere exposure effect alongside previously studied factors cultural geographical closeness influences way viewers vote eurovision
 introduction 
mere-exposure effect tendency people like something more result repeated exposure greater degree prior exposure more potent effect
mere exposure been most famously studied robert zajonc since his initial studies been found tremendously robust effect-one been demonstrated huge array different contexts
example zajonc demonstrated repeated exposure nonsense words chinese ideographs photographs was enough induce positive evaluations objects
subsequent studies found familiarity effects also influence liking sounds shapes people names
amongst other things mere exposure been shown affect food preference infants ratings journals academics gambling voting behaviour elections
often been observed studies interpersonal attraction where repeatedly encountering individual increases ratings how attractive likable they
mere exposure appears effective even when stimuli presented subliminally
already mentioned mere-exposure effect been shown affect voting behaviour
olivola todorov found both familiarity perceptions competency were associated share votes achieved political candidates senate elections usa
verhulst et al re-examined analysis gave greater primacy familiarity
they concluded perceptions competency were mediator familiarity suggested greater familiarity may result candidates being perceived more competent
judgements familiarity happen part at preconscious level verhulst et al proposed perceptions competency context may rationalisation preconscious perceptions familiarity
most studies familiarity mere-exposure effect happen within laboratory setting
even studies looked at voting behaviour where seems data should available at population level mostly limited themselves working laboratory
may due difficulty measuring exactly how familiar candidates voters prior elections well myriad uncontrollable extraneous variables influence way individuals vote
example those who more likely win elections receive more press coverage making them more familiar voters
however prior familiarity candidates well estimated eurovision song contest
eurovision yearly extravaganza european countries some geographically close countries strong links europe represented musical act country
contest televised takes place over course evening during time viewers vote act they thought best
votes within country collated after each country distributes its points number  number number number various acts countries cannot vote their own act
since number eurovision used two-stage voting system
number number there was single semifinal during first stage semifinal voters were equally unfamiliar all contestants
second stage final voters had already seen those acts had go through semifinal while they were unfamiliar finalists who got bypass semifinal
since number there been two semifinals all contestant countries bar host four main financial contributors compete determine who will appear final-half semifinal number half semifinal number
viewer figures consistently show people more likely watch semifinal their own country competes
phenomenon means voters will more familiar finalists who appeared same semifinal their own countries
both formats allow estimates familiarity candidates contestants estimates would very hard achieve most studies real-world voting
abakoumkin looked at data number  number found those countries appeared semifinal achieved higher marks than those had not
although he concluded was due familiarity likely finalists had compete qualify were higher standard than those did not weaker entrants would been weeded out
result difficult say any certainty whether familiarity effect actually at work context
voting eurovision been subject much debate number studies been conducted looking at way countries tend vote within blocs determined cultural closeness
doosje haslam identified reciprocal voting patterns particularly countries more collectivist economically weaker
addition spierdijk vellekoop found geographic proximity religious linguistic cultural congruence presence substantial immigrant population contestant country all influence way countries distribute their points
some commentators argued factors go beyond quality songs performances undermine purity contest though others countered natural voters prefer songs countries they share cultural connections including presumably overlap musical tastes
other studies eurovision found expert judging panels less affected kinds factors than televoters acts appear later final tend receive more points
current study examines whether mere-exposure effect also influences voting behaviour
although been researched previously inability account quality competitors means still open question
rather than simply comparing competitors were semifinal those were not study looks only at participants who qualified via semifinal
assumed voters will more familiar those countries appeared same semifinal their own consequently they will more likely vote them
