 
asked whether people make their confidence judgments more realistic accurate adjusting them aim improving relationship between level confidence correctness answer
adjustment considered include so-called second-order metacognitive judgment
participants first gave confidence judgments about their answers questions about video clip they had just watched
next they attempted increase their accuracy identifying confidence judgments need adjustment then modifying them
participants managed increase their metacognitive realism thus decreasing their absolute bias improving their calibration although effects were small
also examined relationship between confidence judgments were adjusted retrieval fluency phenomenological memory quality participants experienced when first answering questions quality was one either remember associated concrete vivid details know associated feeling familiarity
confidence judgments associated low retrieval fluency memory quality knowing were modified more often
brief our results provide evidence people improve realism their confidence judgments mainly decreasing their confidence incorrect answers
thus study supports conclusion people perform successful second-order metacognitive judgments
 introduction 
realistic confidence judgments about retrieved memories important number contexts e g medical legal contexts
example eyewitness crime must judge his her level confidence about correctly having identified criminal
although many witnesses may feel confident about their identification relation between identification confidence correctness identification weak
spite weakness research also shown jurors often judge eyewitness credibility based level confidence eyewitness expresses
thus level confidence about memory report should accurate possible relative correctness report
general realism confidence judgments pertains how well person's confidence memory report matches correctness report
concept confidence realism includes two aspects calibration relationship between level confidence judgments probability answer being correct discrimination extent respondent discriminate between correct incorrect answers means their confidence judgments
study attended only participants' ability improve calibration
numerous studies reported people often show overconfidence e g they more confident than their memory report correct
case both general knowledge questions event memory questions although basis so-called overconfidence effect been widely debated
given people show lack realism their confidence judgments many contexts finding ways help people improve realism their confidence judgments important
our first aim was investigate whether individuals increase realism their confidence judgments memory reports adjusting confidence judgments they believe most unrealistic
task improving realism confidence judgment designated here adjustment task involves first identifying confidence judgments adjust then modifying them
when trying improve realism confidence judgments people presumably rely various types cues
our second aim was investigate potential usefulness two cues identifying confidence judgments need adjustment modifying them retrieval fluency subjective feeling ease recall phenomenological quality retrieved memories either remember associated concrete vivid detail know associated feeling familiarity
