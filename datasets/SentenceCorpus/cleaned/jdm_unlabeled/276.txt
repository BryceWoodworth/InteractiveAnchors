 
examine how adding attractive but unattainable alternative aua set available but less attractive alternatives influences evaluations near vs distant future sets alternatives
according construal level theory including aua would decrease attractiveness near future sets but may increase attractiveness distant future sets
four studies participants imagined choice situation three alternatives
some participants fourth alternatives was added was attractive but unattainable
half participants each condition imagined making decision near future whereas others imagined making decision distant future
participants then evaluated attractiveness entire set alternatives well each alternative separately
examined choices between jobs computers roommates
last study examined negotiations landlord about apartment
consistent our hypothesis aua increased evaluation distant set decreased evaluation near set
 introduction 
imagine considering vacation caribbean browsing through offers different vacation packages
all packages seem equally attractive but one them stands out being especially attractive  brand new five star hotel offers attractive tours all included quite moderate price
closer look discloses most attractive package offered exclusively members hilton club you not
how would existence very attractive but unattainable alternative aua affect your evaluation set vacation plans travel agency offers
would you stay agency look other agencies
some decision makers may find situation annoying
compared aua other vacation plans would seem mediocre entire menu agency offers would lose attractiveness
other people however could think fact principle agency attractive vacation packages speaks its favor increase their ratings agency menu offers
other cases including aua set alternatives may involve offering especially valuable products indicating they out stock including attractive dishes restaurant's menu indicting they not served day
obviously including aua costless
good strategy
promote sales
would reduce increase attractiveness entire set
related question research phantom decoy effect found when choosing between two equally desirable alternatives adding phantom decoy  namely alternative worse than both initial alternatives dominated one them  increases choice alternative dominates decoy
example decision maker may feel indifferent between five-star restaurant number minutes drive away three-star restaurant number minutes drive away
offering third alternative  four-star restaurant number minutes drive away may cause decision maker prefer five-star restaurant number minutes drive away
both phantom decoys auas irrelevant
unlike phantom decoy however aua more attractive than other alternatives
investigate impact attractive but irrelevant alternative evaluation entire set alternatives
suggest temporal distance making choice one factor may determine influence attractive but unattainable alternatives auas evaluation entire set
specifically based construal level theory propose when alternatives considered proximal future auas decrease attractiveness near future sets but do not decrease even increase attractiveness distant future sets leading interaction between auas temporal distance
what follows explicate how prediction derives clt test four studies
construal level theory proposes psychological distance decision influences individuals' evaluations alternatives systematically changing way they construe alternatives
people tend construe more psychologically distant alternatives higher level namely using more generalized representations
high-level construals essential qualities events therefore consist more central essential features
contrast low-level construals may include more peripheral less essential features events
thus whereas representations near future events rich details representations distant future events omit secondary incidental features events
high level features those when altered removed cause more change situation
example academic lecture changing topic lecture typically perceived more substantial change changing room lecture takes place therefore topic higher level feature talk than its location
there two non-exclusive ways clt might predict distance would increase beneficial impact decrease detrimental impact auas sets alternatives
first desirability considerations i e value action's end state constitute high-level construal alternative should receive more weight more distant future decision
contrast feasibility considerations i e ease difficulty reaching end-state constitute low-level construal alternative should receive less weight more distant future decision
because auas definition highly desirable but not feasible they would more attractive more distant future sets
second temporal distance may affect likelihood assimilation versus contrast
forster liberman kutchel recently showed psychological distance enhances assimilation opposed contrast target category
example one their experiments participants compared their athletic skills either moderately high standard moderately low standard then rated their expected athletic performance athletic competition would take place either next day year later
compared control condition time was not specified distant time perspective enhanced assimilation i e produced high self-rating after comparison high standard low self-rating after comparison low standard whereas proximal time perspective enhanced contrast i e produced low self-rating after comparison high standard high self-rating after comparison low standard
possibly temporal proximity would make participants more likely contrast aua set cause set evaluated more negatively than without aua
temporal distance other hand would reduce contrast produce assimilation set aua
result entire set alternatives will not look worse may even look better presence aua than without
report four studies examine prediction auas decrease attractiveness near future sets but do not decrease even increase attractiveness distant future sets
addition predicted interaction between time adding aua there might also main effects both factors
specifically adding aua might produce either overall assimilation effect overall contrast effect
temporal distance too might decrease increase attractiveness set alternatives due temporal discounting savoring respectively
