some engineers argue application multi-attribute utility theory while others argue what they call heuristics
clarify differences among methods i first ask whether each method aims at achieving coherence correspondence
analyzing statements design literature i argue utility theory aims at achieving coherence heuristics aim at achieving correspondence

 introduction 
kenneth hammond pointed out method evaluated both according its internal consistency coherence its external performance correspondence
important keep distinction mind when comparing decision methods because one method could achieving coherence while another method could achieving correspondence
example take-the-best heuristic violates criterion coherence transitivity satisfied linear regression while under some conditions take-the-best outperforms regression criterion correspondence predictive accuracy
article i show how coherence correspondence distinction inform conversation about decision methods within field had minimal overlap jdm judgment decision making field engineering design
number national science foundation nsf engineering design program director george hazelrigg wrote increasingly recognized engineering design decision-intensive process p number
nsf since number sponsored numerous workshops decision-based design
accreditation board engineering technology also defines engineering design decision-making process
what decisions do design engineers make
design engineers choose among alternative concepts
design concept technical specification artifact detailed enough so engineer predict reasonably accurately how artifact will function
example concept chair would specify material used build each chair part geometrical relationships among parts
there typically many attributes design concepts evaluated
examples attributes chair concept durability comfort production cost
hereafter i refer design concepts simply designs
some engineers argue application multi-attribute utility theory choosing among designs while others argue what they call heuristics stuart pugh's convergence process
debate large ignored coherence correspondence distinction
i ask two questions use distinction inform debate
first question whether each method aims at achieving coherence correspondence both
analyzing published statements design literature i argue multi-attribute utility theory aims at achieving coherence while pugh convergence process aims at achieving correspondence
second question if achieving coherence always implies achieving correspondence
important answer because while design objective decision-making correspondence difficult assess coherence easier assess used surrogate
surrogate coherence useful inferring objective correspondence relationship between two must known
i argue coherence does not always imply correspondence design also case decision problems studied jdm
i conclude study conditions under coherence implies does not imply correspondence topic where design jdm research might connect
before asking answering two questions i review two methods making decisions prominent place engineering design theory practice
