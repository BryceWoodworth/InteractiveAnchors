factual quantitative information about patients e g probability surviving surgery was given vignette form case descriptions visual analogue scales  vas's
differentiation consolidation theory predicts not only attractiveness facts but also mental representations objective facts themselves will restructured post-decision processes support decision
after decision participants were asked reproduce objective facts about patients
results showed distortions objective facts were used consolidate prior decision
consolidation process relied facts initially favoring non-chosen alternative facts rated less rather than more important
 introduction 
differentiation consolidation diff con theory process theory human decision making
models decision making process involving different kinds sub processes leading final decision
according theory human decision makers structure restructure both evaluations facts about decision alternatives when they make decision after decision
goal process reach sufficient support chosen alternative
example positively evaluated aspect initially preferred alternative bolstered make alternative seem even better when decision been reached
post-decision consolidation phase process continues strengthen decision when afterthoughts outcomes follow
theory shares process attractiveness restructuring approach decision making number other models human decision making some were reviewed brownstein simon snow read
empirical decision research shown time after time value attractiveness evaluation diagnostic value facts restructured before after decision supporting theories
chosen alternative upgraded attractiveness diagnostic value evidence pro alternative non chosen alternative downgraded before after decision
however there lack empirical investigations consolidation facts themselves
if decision maker given objective travel time e g number min fact one alternative decision between two job offers she he may change evaluation fact e g relaxing boring process making decision
evaluation does not mean quantitative facts representation must change
decision maker should able communicate exact travel time e g number min within non-systematic random error even if there was evaluative restructuring no facts restructuring
facts consolidation appears when quantitative qualitative facts decision problem communicated reproduced distorted way support decision
hindsight paradigm introduced fischhoff uses judgment approach some similarity present decision approach but focus post-event outcome phase
fischhoff other researchers following him studied how memory person's prior quantitative probability judgments kind self generated quantitative fact was distorted after outcome knowledge
they found general quantitative distortions were direction knew all before bias
mather shafir jonhson studied post-decision memory attributions chosen non-chosen alternatives after decision alternatives described qualitative features varying attractiveness
they found features positive attractiveness were attributed comparatively more often chosen alternative than non-chosen alternative
opposite was found negative features
when alternative was assigned participants memory attributions were less supportive assigned option than option was chosen voluntary
shows decision process had selective effect memories evaluative features
gurkmankin levy hershey had their participants make treatment choices yes no concerning medical treatment side effects success rate number percent
however since all patients different he doctor can't certain your probability
instruction communicated uncertainty about probability fact was used distortions supporting participant's choice
instead investigating qualitative evaluative features uncertain probabilities present studies will investigate precise quantitative facts well-defined attributes find out if facts distorted post-decision memory reproductions
specify present studies were designed test diff con prediction facts restructured post-decision consolidation
if hypothesis confirmed sub-processes restructuring process will investigated
one example subprocesses restructuring mental representations both chosen non-chosen alternative
chosen alternative restructured greater extent than non-chosen alternative
new problem not been focused past since attractiveness facts diagnosticity facts were focus  not facts themselves
earlier studies differentiation consolidation shown attractiveness restructuring does not normally appear most important decisive attribute support choice
instead kind restructuring focuses important conflict attributes favor non-chosen alternative
fact attractiveness consolidation processes real-life decision sometimes turn disadvantages chosen alternative into advantages after decision
was first reported svenson hill later verified salo svenson another real-life context
do not expect drastic restructuring facts but according diff con predict no systematic changes most important decisive attribute but systematic changes other attributes particular changes facts supporting non-chosen alternative
also want introduce visual analogue scale vas way new decision process research
scale been used primarily health care measure pain other contexts quantitative response scale
but present context will used give information about facts
according diff con theory decision sufficiently involving important trigger differentiation consolidation processes
therefore will use difficult engaging medical problem following empirical studies
predict number facts consolidation will restructure distort reproductions quantitative facts support chosen alternative number quantitative facts restructuring will follow same pattern attractiveness restructuring concern predominantly other attributes than most important decisive attribute particular conflict attributes number facts restructuring achieved through changes both chosen increasing facts support non-chosen alternative weakening facts support non-chosen alternative
also want number introduce facts presented vas scales
design will balanced order control response regression effects easily confounded true restructuring processes depending prior decision
first study economics students serve participants use vas visual analogue scale present medical vignette case
second study replicates first study group participants who familiar medical problems vas
