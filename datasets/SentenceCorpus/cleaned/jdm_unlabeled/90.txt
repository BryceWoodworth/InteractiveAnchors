 
gender difference risk preferences women being more averse risky choices robust experimental finding
speculating sources difference croson gneezy recently pointed tendency women experience emotions more strongly suggested feeling more strongly about negative outcomes would lead greater risk-aversion
here test hypothesis international survey number respondents india number us where ask questions about hypothetical lottery
both countries find emotions about outcomes stronger among women effect partially mediates gender difference willingness enter lottery
 introduction 
why do women engage less risky behaviors than men
prior work demonstrates females' lower risk preferences less risky behavior robust across variety contexts
particular relevance current work researchers documented substantial gender differences financial decisions involving risk
women instance substantially less likely than men enter lotteries
number meta-theoretical perspectives  structural role theories evolutionary approaches  consistent observations
however only recently researchers begun study underlying causal mechanisms gender differences
there several possible explanations gender differences entering lotteries
first males females whatever reason may assign different probabilities likelihood winning losing lotteries second men women may experience different positive negative reactions benefits costs entering lotteries
recent review literature gender differences risk preferences croson gneezy pointed research tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions outcomes events than men
authors hypothesized tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions outcomes may explain gender differences risk preferences
goal current study address heretofore untested hypothesis using cross-national sample
elaborate tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions would explain gender differences risky financial decisions whether enter lottery if compared men women evaluated losing more strongly b strength negative evaluations losing predicted decisions about whether enter lotteries
thus predict evaluations losing will mediate gender differences tendencies join lotteries
but assuming moment females tend experience stronger emotional reactions all outcomes suggested croson gneezy they would also experience stronger positive reactions winning
wouldn't stronger positive reactions offset negative emotional reactions creating null effect gender lottery decisions
argue typical setup lotteries assigns much higher probabilities losing than winning does not allow stronger positive reactions winning counterbalance stronger negative reactions losing
other words because people know they most likely lose expected emotional reactions losing lotteries should much stronger predictor decisions enter them than expected emotional reactions winning lotteries
thus even if do find stronger reactions winning losing among women expect only reactions losing will influence decisions play
results recent study harris et al consistent hypothesis
using sample undergraduate psychology students researchers measured gender differences stated likelihood engaging variety risky behaviors
researchers found most domains females weighed negative outcomes more strongly than did males
further compared males females expected negative outcomes occur greater likelihood
finally harris colleauges found evaluation negative outcomes well expected likelihood those outcomes partially mediated gender differences stated willingness engage risky behaviors
but extent decision-makers overestimate likelihood negatively valued events cannot know certain whether gender differences reactions losing explain gender differences lottery decisions
thus one goal current reseaerch make probabilities winning losing known explicit measure gender differences evaluations winning losing under conditions
explained below second goal study was offer cross-cultural test prediction
study outlined section follow tests hypotheses using amazon's mechanical turk
users tend disproportionately u s india
thus our dataset allows us test robustness our hypotheses using men women two different continents
prior work addressing cross-cultural differences risk taking found americans tend less risk seeing than chinese
hsee weber use cushion hypothesis explain cross-national differences arguing times financial need decision makers collectivist cultures rely network ties help
cushion safety net thus allows more risky behavior
thus might expect observe more risk taking among indians than americans
most importantly however should expect predicted gender differences occur above beyond any cross-cultural differences
