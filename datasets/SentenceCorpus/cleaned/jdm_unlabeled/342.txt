 
several approaches judgment decision making emphasize effort-reducing properties heuristics
one prominent example effort-reduction recognition heuristic rh proposes judgments made relying one single cue recognition ignoring other information
our research aims shed light conditions under rh more useful thus relied more often
propose intuitive thinking fast automatic effortless whereas deliberative thinking slower stepwise more effortful
because effort-reduction thus much more important when processing information deliberately hypothesize rh should more often relied situations
two city-size-experiments instructed participants think either intuitively deliberatively assessed use rh through formal measurement model
results revealed both experiments use rh was more likely when judgments were made deliberatively rather than intuitively
conclude potential application heuristics not necessarily consequence intuitive processing
rather their effort-reducing features probably most beneficial when thinking more deliberatively
 introduction 
heuristics meant reduce effort
indeed without issues processing effort information search costs there would little need examining fewer cues reducing difficulty storing retrieving cue values simplifying weighting principles cues integrating less information  all characterize heuristic strategies
following pioneering work herbert simon most approaches judgment decision making dealing heuristic processing specifically emphasize its simplifying properties  though there some discourse whether heuristics generally less accurate than complex strategies
however despite disagreements many would concur heuristics render judgments decisions easier one way another
how does heuristic processing relate concept intuitive thinking
answer question  treated differently literature  one must first specify characteristics intuition
herein like many others define intuitive thinking automatic fast effortless unconscious based vast amounts prior experience
moreover intuition usually deemed involve integration multiple pieces information weighted additive manner
intuitive processes little no information-processing costs enable individuals quickly integrate multiple reasons their decisions compensatory way
finally intuition typically contrasted deliberation describes slow effortful stepwise mostly rule-governed processes
sum alter oppenheimer epley eyre stated thinking involves two distinct processing systems one quick effortless associative intuitive another slow effortful analytic deliberate p number
note however not entirely clear whether intuitive deliberative thinking actually represent two qualitatively different modes thinking rather end points same dimension
if one accepts two basic notions namely one central appeal heuristics lies their effort-reducing properties b intuitive thinking more effortless than deliberation thus rendering effort-reduction less appealing following conjecture seems straightforward deliberation will increase need heuristic processing
stated differently heuristics should much more helpful when judgments decisions performed slow stepwise effortful manner under conditions deliberation
situation heuristics may significantly relieve mind burdensome computations  without necessarily leading reduced accuracy
intuitive thinking however will comprise automatic information integration makes simplification partially obsolete
note again hypothesis need not imply intuition deliberation completely different manners thinking  so long more intuitive thinking accepted less effortful than more deliberative thinking our conjecture should hold
indicated above our view intuition should actually reduce reliance heuristics not consistently echoed literature
indeed some considered heuristic processing sense attribute substitution result intuitive thinking though they acknowledge attribute substitution also deliberate strategy
also although focusing single-cue mechanisms rather than attribute substitution gigerenzer stated heuristics used without awareness
latter case each provides potential mechanism intuition
similarly gigerenzer seems advocate fast-and-frugal heuristics his adaptive toolbox approach intuitive mechanisms intuitions ignore information
gut feelings spring rules thumb extract only few pieces information ignore rest p number
however neither fast-and-frugal heuristics approach nor other related notions per se seem make strong claims about extent use heuristics mark intuitive thinking
theoretical positions seems largely open question
nonetheless intuition reliance heuristics often been equated past
contrast propose clear difference between intuitive thinking heuristics  especially those put forward part adaptive toolbox outlined above intuition characterized speedy integration multiple pieces information
heuristics contrast ignore information
indeed previous empirical findings consistent our conjecture
example glockner betsch showed individuals capable integrating complex information within surprisingly short time frame
measuring reliance more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions risky choices using cognitive reflection test cokely kelly showed more reflective thinking characterized more heuristic search processes
similarly frederick proposed choice heuristics result more deliberate cognitive processes e g elimination-by-aspects but become automated when affective responses rapidly generated e g choosing-by-liking
other studies directly inducing intuitive vs deliberative thinking revealed heuristics more likely applied deliberate rather than intuitive judgments
example asking participants think carefully increased reliance anchoring heuristic
contrast those instructed answer spontaneously relied their experiences judgmental object rather than experimentally provided anchors
similar results been reported frequency judgments basketball predictions judgments randomness
