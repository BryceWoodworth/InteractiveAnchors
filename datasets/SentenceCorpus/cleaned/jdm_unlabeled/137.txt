show overbidding effect more strongly related individuals' competitiveness traits than comprehension lottery's payoff mechanism
 introduction 
decision making often involves choices between risky outcomes
prospect theory expected utility theory both posit individuals balance outcomes their potentially weighted probability occurrence means certainty equivalent binary lottery will lie somewhere between lowest highest outcomes
however gneezy list wu document cases where individuals value risky prospect less than its worst possible realization
they call phenomenon uncertainty effect demonstrate its existence various laboratory experiments including real hypothetical pricing tasks inter-temporal choice tasks well field experiment sportscard market
uncertainty effect however disappears within-subject designs observed only lotteries do not involve cash
gneezy list wu study sparked small but growing literature examining robustness their findings
example sonsino found occurrence uncertainty effect internet-based within-subject design
keren willemsen argued however gneezy list wu's results were artifact poorly understood experimental instructions
specifically series experiments they replaced lottery coin toss spinner wheel clearly define payoff probabilities
they also added comprehension checks
their new protocols eliminated uncertainty effect almost completely
similarly rydval et al used physical lottery formats i e drawing good gift exchange deferred payment closed bag containing two goods identical except their face value instead verbal lottery descriptions observed uncertainty effect almost disappeared
other hand simonsohn argued uncertainty effect neither caused fact gneezy list wu's manipulation uncertainty was fully confounded number outcomes presented subjects nor subjects may had erroneously believed lottery could result payment number
instead he argued uncertainty effect occurs consequence direct risk aversion
direct risk aversion arises literal distaste uncertainty i e uncertainty enters directly into people's utility function
theoretically gill stone showed uncertainty effect arise tournaments where two agents competing win fixed monetary prize
similarly andreoni sprenger argued uncertainty effect not anomalous if certain uncertain consumption evaluated different utility parameters
they argue marginal utility uncertain consumption diminishes more quickly than marginal utility certain consumption
because uncertain utility more concave than certain utility one expect gamble valued less than its worst possible outcome
paper document cases polar opposite uncertainty effect found gneezy list wu where individuals value outcome risky prospect more than its best possible realization
demonstrate cases where subjects willing pay much three times value best possible realization lottery second price auction
term effect overbidding effect
addition documenting overbidding effect seek identify causes effect
three non-exclusive possible explanations results observe number confusion about auction mechanism number confusion failure comprehension about lotteries i e subjects did not understand payoff mechanism lottery number subjects derive utility winning being top dog experiment i e walk out experiment top dog among their peers
regarding first two issues plott zeiler show often-reported wtp-wta disparity likely result subjects' confusion elicitation mechanism-suggesting wtp-wta divergence not underlying feature preference per se but rather result misunderstanding bidding mechanism
tempting attribute overbidding effect elements value elicitation mechanism
example kagel levin's non-risky induced value experiments subjects tended slightly overbid second price auction
experiments subjects assigned value v winner auction paid difference between his her value second highest bid price profit v  price
second price auction individual's weakly dominant strategy submit bid equal v but kagel levin show many people submit bids higher than v
kagel levin attributed overbidding either dominant bidding strategy not being transparent weak learning feedback mechanisms second price sealed bid auction
although result often taken stylized fact associated second price auctions lusk shogren document several more recent induced value studies focus all bidders' values not just market price tend find behaviour more in-line theoretical predicted bidding behaviour second price auction
even if accept kagel levin's result over-bidding second price auction difficult conclude primary cause behaviour observed here lotteries where subjects' values v unknown
although subjects our experiments overbid would expect people's bids lie somewhere close expected payoff not close maximum payoff lottery
stated differently overbidding effect observed kagel levin might explain bids slightly higher than expected value lottery but cannot explain bids excess maximum lottery payout
use experimental design varied amount training about auction mechanism amount feedback after each round
varying amount training allows us directly test whether confusion elicitation mechanism may explain observed results
other hand amount feedback after each round allows us test whether mechanism may induced more competitiveness sessions
also measured subject's personal traits regarding comprehension how lotteries work well their competitiveness
our results suggest overbidding effect small part attributed comprehension how lotteries work but extensive training second price auction does not eliminate overbidding effect thus ruling out confusion elicitation mechanism primary cause overbidding
find comprehension negatively related overbidding effect while competitiveness traits positively related overbidding behavior
