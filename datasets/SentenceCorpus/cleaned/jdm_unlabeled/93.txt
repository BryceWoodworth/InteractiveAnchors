current study explored how differences processing may emerge through diurnal patters circadian rhythm varies across individuals
predicted during circadian off-times participants would exhibit stronger framing effects whereas framing effects would relatively weaker during on-times
six-hundred eighty five individuals took part study findings supported our hypothesis revealing diurnal pattern risk responding varies across number hour circadian cycle
 introduction 
most studied examples risk decision making revolve around risky-choice framing its foundations prospect theory
according prospect theory presentation outcome either loss gain affects amount risk person willing accept
effect due differences perceived subjective value captured s-shaped value function
function concave gains leads risk-averse preferences convex losses leads preference risky alternatives
most well known example framing effect participants read asian disease will potentially kill number people
participant then asked choose between two alternatives dealing disease
one alternative contains certain outcome e g number people saved certain other stated likelihood outcome e g number number probability all number people will saved number number probability no one will saved
alternatives presented either positively people saved negatively people die
importantly both alternatives contain exactly same expected outcome numerical magnitude
people tend choose certain risk free option when problem framed positively risky option when framed negatively
while framing effect proved enduring number studies pointed toward processing differences determining factor strength framing effect
one most widely investigated personality factors framing research need-for-cognition nfc
personality trait reflects extent people engage effortful thought how much they enjoy doing so
thus individuals high levels nfc should process tasks more effortfully whereas individuals low trait should use less effort
research shown framing effects lessened individuals who high nfc
similar results were found simon fagley halleran when high nfc was combined math ability depth processing
related research shown merely requesting elaboration rationale influence likelihood framing effects
other research shown presenting task either high low personal importance should lead more less effortful processing respectively influences likelihood framing effects
overall findings studies tend show when more effort involved task framing effect attenuated one exception
somewhat similar approach research fuzzy-trace theory shown when greater gist like memory retrieval used framing effects robust whereas when more precise verbatim retrieval relied framing effects less evident
recent investigations shown support fuzzy trace viable means understanding framing effects
one ability factor been identified numeracy refers propensity integrate complex numeric information
research shown low numerate individuals respond more superficially non-numeric sources information i e frame consequently they been shown demonstrate stronger framing effects
investigation another individual difference variable frederick used cognitive reflection test show risky-choice framing effects were attenuated people relying more conscious deliberative processing more robust people using more automatic processing
similar findings were reported oechssler roider schmitz
other research shown ability differences may influence framing effect
one study stanovich west found individuals relatively higher cognitive ability measured sat scores were less likely exhibit framing effects
later research shown working memory also plays role framing effects but exact nature role not been completely defined
recently however stanovich west reexamined their original assumptions larger study their findings seem call their prior hypotheses framing effects into question
taken together findings create picture how framing effects differ across individuals situations
clearly type processing involved important predictable influences choices people make
findings suggest framing effects will less likely when person being more thoughtful diligent involved decision task
variety factors may influence effort deliberative processing person uses
