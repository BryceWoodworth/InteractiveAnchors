 introduction 
past decade since was baptized recognition heuristic inspired much innovative research
been studied extensively normative descriptive point view provoked some controversial debate at times
many other interesting investigations notwithstanding majority empirical studies dealt descriptive question whether what extent recognition cue considered isolation  how often rh actually used
whereas some aimed show rarely case altogether others concentrated bounding conditions determinants rh-use possible individual differences tests alternative cognitive process models
clearly rh precise model makes exact predictions about choices underlying processes
however gain insight about whether under conditions predictions actually correct measurement must also precise
although many agree promising fruitful research strategy uncover situational individual determinants fast-and-frugal heuristics broder press yet much less clear how study measure rh-use
what may at first glance appear rather trivial question turns out represent substantial challenge my view source much controversy surrounding rh
so far emphasis been put paradigms materials appropriate studying rh
indeed pachur et al provided extensive discussion questions
they suggested no less than eight critical methodological necessities adequate investigation test rh should their view comprise
also they reviewed extant literature argued many previously published studies yield drawbacks respect eight points
however even if their list studies problematic features had not been somewhat incomplete does bear dilemma proposed necessities if taken seriously leave rather small niche empirical investigations rh worse yet severe problems when attempting measure rh-use
i will sketch problem what follows
central point pachur et al argue rh more likely used when objects naturally recognized cues must retrieved memory
line assumption inferences memory more often based simple heuristics assumption received support past
central argument favoring naturally recognized objects rh hinges decision makers acquiring recognition-criterion-relation through experience thus learning trust recognition when appropriate
those who  like myself  buy into arguments rule out teaching participants artificial objects providing them cues faced severe obstacle how measure use rh when there no control over participants' cue knowledge
assume participant faced judgment two cities larger recognizes one but not other
if she provides judgment recognized object higher criterion value choice line rh produced
however cases adherence cannot imply recognition was considered isolation thus do not provide information about use rh
more generally participant may adhered prediction cue question actually considering some entirely different piece information points same direction hilbig press
case comparing recognized unrecognized city example decision maker may chosen recognized city based knowledge city international airport large university like
thus so long there no control over participants' further knowledge specific paired-comparisons adherence prediction rh non-diagnostic
broder schiffer put simple counting choices compatible model tells us almost nothing about underlying strategy p number
best remedy caveat course unconfound recognition further knowledge if participants taught certain objects cue patterns  typically done when studying other fast-and-frugal heuristics alternative approaches  experimenter full control investigate whether additional cues alter degree participants adhere rh
indeed unconfounding different cues vital when considering adherence simple one-cue strategies
moreover full experimental control over cue patterns allows application sophisticated methods strategy classification broder schiffer proposed bridge gap between theories multi-attribute decision making empirically observed choices means formal measurement model
bayesian approach provides information about decision strategy most likely generated data vector
recently approach been extended considering choice outcomes response latencies confidence ratings
however both elegant approaches necessitate teaching providing all cue patterns set artificial objects so discriminate between different strategies
clearly at odds central methodological recommendations pachur et al who call using naturally recognized objects without teaching providing any further information
overall paradigm most favored pachur colleagues only three pieces information available researchers must base assessment whether rh was used i objects were presented given trial including their true position criterion dimension ii objects recognized participant iii object chosen judged higher criterion value
how based pieces information measure rh-use
so far three classes measures been applied viz
adherence rate enhanced measures based adherence rates formal measurement model
what follows i will introduce measures briefly discuss their theoretical advantages limitations present simulations re-analysis existing empirical data evaluate them
