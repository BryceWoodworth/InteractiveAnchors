hypothesize donations increase number recipients albeit at decreasing rate reflect donors' knowledge recipients
donations involve different concepts fairness-equity equality-and interact numbers alternatives
two experiments respondents indicated how they would donate lottery winnings number euros
results showed first more was donated non-governmental organizations campaigns respondents knew better
second total donations increased number recipients albeit at decreasing rate
third when limited giving only one multiple alternatives donors gave less than when restriction did not apply
fourth variability donations both increase decrease number potential recipients

 introduction 
recently much literature highlighted importance numbers alternatives choice
considered two perspectives
one investigators reported effects when people make unique selections different numbers alternatives
example studies documented differential satisfaction choice decisions involving pens pension plans gift boxes wines
moreover recent meta-analysis suggests magnitude effects depends preconditions choice moderators contexts decisions made
focus second perspective what happens when people allocate resources across different numbers alternatives
topic present paper
specifically consider issue context charitable donations investigate effects numbers alternatives amount total donations well their distribution across charitable organizations ngos non-governmental organizations specific campaigns
both issues important theoretical practical viewpoints
example when attempting maximize donations ngos might consider whether donors perceive them belonging small large subsets potential recipients
at same time ngos often seek funds different campaigns important know how number presentation campaigns affect total donations
report two experiments
first explore effects when donors allocate funds across different numbers ngos
second investigate what happens when single ngo solicits contributions different numbers campaigns
short find two effects increasing number alternatives total contributions increase albeit at decreasing rate distributions donations affected
specifically tend become less egalitarian case ngos but more so case campaigns
second experiment also investigate use drop down menus donation interfaces soliciting donations specific campaigns
when current practice choice limited one several alternatives contributions lower than when restriction does not apply
