products focus present study poems sources poets
explore manner poet's name affects experience reading poem
study number establishes effect wish address poet's reputation enhances evaluation poem
study number asks whether only reported evaluation poem enhanced poet's name was case emperor's new clothes enhancement genuine unaware
finding latter study number explores whether poet's name changes reader's experience so sense one reading different poem
conclude not so much attributed poem really differs unattributed poem just ineffably better
name highly regarded poet seems prime quality poem becomes somehow better
more subtle bias than deliberate one rejected study number but bias nonetheless
ethical implications kind effect discussed
 introduction 
hearing star soprano attending exhibition famous painter expected exceptional experiences
so they should be-their reputation was acquired precisely their ability provide exceptional experiences
reputation seems capable enhancing experience even retrospect when only discover next day had just heard diva visited season's hottest exhibition
but hindsight affect remembered experience cannot affect past experience itself
actual experience poem rather than expected remembered experience affected expectations real time
if so-how does happen
when experience product changed its label change does not occur product
would undetected audio recording photograph
intuition underlying juliet's famous call rose any other name would smell sweet
however experience not determined bottom-up processes alone
distal stimuli only experienced through proximal stimuli they give rise total experience takes place eyes beholder even ultimately mind beholder
hence cognitive psychologists obvious expectations alter experience
social psychologists cynics however will quick point out one cannot rely people's reports their experiences decide matter because reports not always sincere unbiased
glowing evaluation form cognitive snobbery it's supposed excellent so i will say excellent social desirability
caveat notwithstanding studies consumer behavior expectations typically manipulated through brand name price other marketing actions evaluations solicited via expressed judgments revealed preferences
allison uhl were among first study variables
they found people could not identify their favorite brand beer blind tasting
later results were more startling blind tasters cannot distinguish dog food pate experienced violinists cannot distinguish stradivari violins new violins
other hand judges purport distinguish among identical stimuli when labeled differently even just framed differently
when comparing informed evaluations blind evaluations ratings differently labeled but identical products some researchers automatically assume real change occurred experience e g makens number p number well-known brand positively affected taste italics ours ss experienced samples turkey meat while others assume will not
fact however should acknowledge certainly possible psychologically speaking actual experience genuinely different blind informed consumers possible actual experience just same blind informed consumers
question clearly empirical one moreover its answer could well differ context context individual individual
yet few studies tackled problem
lee et al when reviewing literature stated remains unclear whether manipulating participant's knowledge also changes experience itself just remains unclear most taste-test studies whether brand identity just another input overall evaluation whether modifies actual gustatory experience p number
their own study exception will described study number below
present paper another exception
few studies expectation effects used cultural products
yet cultural products particular interest both because our intrinsic interest them because question how expectations affect cultural experiences how distinguish between sincere effects cynical hypocritical ones particularly vexing regard ineffable ambiguous experiences artistic ones
whereas wines energy drinks pain-killers affect consumer's physiology lending credence term marketing placebos cultural products paintings music consumed primarily their effect mind
harder test whether mental experience altered than whether physiological one
conundrum itself been focus various cultural products e g yasmina reza's play art
present paper will focus ineffable product-poetry
study number sets stage establishing effect will later study depth
consists number experiments
experiment number shows readers poetry influenced poet's name
experiment number incidentally adds without cue quality imparted name reputable poet readers cannot reliably distinguish good poetry bad
taken together study number shows poems' ratings sensitive poet's reputation but not poem's quality
raises sad possibility effect may wholly due pretension social desirability many outside critics modern contemporary art suspect
study number sets out explore question
tests one particular model call emperor's new clothes effect enc short honoring anderson's famous parable
according model reading poem same without poet's name giving rise same aesthetic experience enhanced rating solely due deliberate conscious adding points when poem attributed famous poet motivated perhaps desire appear discriminating cultivated
study number tests alternative model posits inclusion poet's name alters very experience poem so once poem's author known poem no longer same
other words poem-unchanged written page-is somehow changed reader's mind
study looking at judgments many specific poem attributes
regard main novel contribution paper not showing what happens even previously unstudied context poetry appreciation but rather attempting understand mental process whereby happens
particular offer experimental paradigms allow one infer whether enhanced evaluation poem any object when labeled expectation-raising manner driven deliberate social considerations system number product happens out awareness system number product
unfortunate social bias inevitable cognitive bias
