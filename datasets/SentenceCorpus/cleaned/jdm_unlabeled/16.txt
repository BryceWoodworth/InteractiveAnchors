 
contrary common belief more information always better gigerenzer et al showed simple decision strategies rely little information quite successful
success simple strategies depends both bets about structure environment core capacities human mind recognition memory
however interplay between environment mind's core capacities rarely been precisely modeled
illustrate how environment-mind interactions could formally modeled within cognitive architecture act-r
act-r integrated theory mind tuned statistical structure environment account variety phenomena learning problem solving decision making
here focus studying decision strategies show how success theses strategies particular environments depends characteristics core cognitive capacities recognition short term memory

team surgeons hovers over steve austin test pilot working feverishly replace his injured legs right arm eye superbly engineered bionic substitutes
voice over hear gentlemen rebuild him
technology
capability make world's first bionic man
steve austin will man
better than he was before
better stronger faster
cut next steve austin six million dollar man racing across field seeing objects at distance his better-than-a-telescope eye
like steve austin's doctors most us believe would better off if were stronger faster
similarly would better off at least would had better college transcripts if had been blessed bionic cognitive abilities unfailing memories ability hold complex equations mind
another view humble cognitive capacities human mind those limitations  forgetting  may serve important functions
arguably most important function memory not simply store all information encounter but provide us important information specific situations
view human memory system organized way facilitates retrieval information recent frequent sensitive context
way system retrieves memories information most likely need
many word processors incorporate timesaving feature illustrates view forgetting
when user goes open document file program presents file buffer list recently opened files user select
whenever desired file included list user spared effort searching through file hierarchy
device work efficiently however word processor must provide users files they actually want
does so forgetting files considered unlikely needed basis assumption time since file was last opened negatively correlated its likelihood being needed now
similarly if you want remember where you parked your car quite useful forget where you parked before
there growing evidence also other domains language acquisition cognitive limits beneficial while too much thinking even hurt performance example sports experts implicit category learning decaro thomas beilock press
line view mind adaptation environment program fast frugal heuristics takes position humans possess repertoire cognitive strategies heuristics solve specific problems
gigerenzer et al called collection cognitive strategies adaptive toolbox
rationality heuristics not logical but ecological success anchored both structure environment core capacities human mind
cognitive strategy simple exploiting core capacities recognition recall memory human mind through evolution learning highly automatized requiring little no effort
goldstein gigerenzer consider heuristics adaptive strategies evolved tandem fundamental psychological mechanisms p number
within fast frugal program interplay between environment mind rarely been explored detailed models core capacities
models heuristics presupposed specific core capacities mind recognition memory without embedding core capacity directly into model
other words models heuristics many other models decision making underspecified regard how decision making will affected interaction between mind's core capacities structure environment
goal paper illustrate how cognitive modeling capture environment-mind interactions thereby inform decision making research
particular employ formal cognitive architecture act-r explore issue
principle other cognitive models memory could used purpose analyzing relation between environment memory performance inference strategies
fact believe main findings regarding memory function ecological rationality inference strategies would remain largely same long reasonable model memory was used
one model rem descends sam but enriched bayesian analysis spirit j r anderson's rational analysis
another good candidate would minerva-dm been shown account wide variety judgment phenomena including example availability representativeness heuristics
relation between act-r other models will discussed more detail general discussion where will also illustrate how act-r could extended topics tasks beyond those examined here
