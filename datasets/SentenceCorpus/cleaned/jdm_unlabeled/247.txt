 
using brunswik's lens model framework hammond proposed interpersonal conflict theory explain nature source resolution disagreement cognitive conflict between parties performing judgment tasks
early review brehmer highlighted potential approach example understanding structure cognitive conflicts effect task person variables judgment policy change conflict resolution
however our bibliographic content reviews number present day demonstrate research cognitive conflict using lens model declined sharply while research task conflict grown dramatically
there also been shift less theoretical precision methodological rigor
discuss possible reasons developments suggest ways lens model research cognitive conflict revitalized borrowing recent theoretical methodological advances field judgment decision making
 introduction 
was during cognitive revolution psychology cold war period political history when hammond proposed conflicts between parties performing judgment tasks could viewed purely cognitive thus making unnecessary examine motivations values conflicting parties social psychologists might do
interpersonal conflict ipc theory hammond outlined how cognitive conflict could construed within brunswik's lens model framework well experimental methods researchers could use study nature source resolution disagreement between parties performing judgment tasks
briefly cognitive conflict represents differences how parties conceptualize solution problem
instance different parties may different policies solving judgment problem terms information they rely
inconsistency how parties apply their judgment policies also lead disagreement
thus according ipc theory parties striving make joint judgment same task could conflict because they disagree principle they different policies how solve problem practice they inconsistent application their policies
importantly while cognitive conflict different conflict caused motivational value differences among parties cognitive differences evolve into motivational value-laden conflicts
under circumstances underlying cognitive differences very difficult detect resolve
early review research using ipc theory published psychological bulletin brehmer highlighted potential approach advancing our understanding cognitive conflict both laboratory real world settings
despite since time ipc theory appears featured little growing field judgment decision making jdm
example historical review theories field goldstein hogarth provide only passing mention ipc theory when considering developments judgment research
need conflict theories including cognitive conflict seems apparent era characterized international terrorism where amongst other things parties disagree about level threat how manage minimize era characterized movement towards greater use alternative dispute resolution
fact today theory cognitive conflict could benefit recent theoretical methodological advances field jdm
instance jdm researchers shown individuals likely use simple process models when performing judgment tasks non-cognitive factors emotions may affect how individuals make judgments
addition researchers employed new tools virtual environments computer simulations when studying judgment behavior
our goal evaluate evolution ipc theory its inception present day
specifically consider how research cognitive conflict developed terms its theoretical underpinnings methodological stance review findings empirical research cognitive conflict
our goal modest focus our efforts cognitive conflict directly emerged ipc paradigm related lens model framework
review conflict theories research more generally not within scope present paper
article organized into three main parts
first consider emergence ipc theory outlining its roots brunswikian psychology experimental methodology employed early research findings
second number present day trace evolution ipc theory cognitive conflict research conducting bibliographic content reviews publications cite central articles hammond number brehmer number
finally discuss future ipc theory cognitive conflict research considering opportunities theoretical advancement methodological innovation offered currently field jdm
hope will inspire future researchers
