 introduction 
what cutting-edge approaches judgment decision making will influential next decade
hot topics today will turn into enduring foundational assumptions tomorrow
questions concern new investigators they place bets their most precious commodity their time choosing topics hopes making impact field
however although new investigators strive original forward thinking they also counseled conduct programmatic cumulative research
make progress important topics scientists must build prior accomplishments their own those others
essay i provide overview recent developments one theory their origins prior scientific research
moreover topics were chosen view future
my bets about approaches been productive gathering momentum
fortunately prognostications more than simply my opinions barely more than perhaps because they based behavior community scholars
ideas continue gain greater currency our field searches new paradigms preoccupations
what topics i others believe taking off will continue progress
among new trends most established topic-one draws rich supply prior research-is memory
researchers increasingly turning memory explanations judgment decision making
memory much more than memorization i presently explain
growing number contemporary theories memory common denominator
development defined changes across lifespan another topic gained ground
because links aging adolescent risk taking psychiatry public health neuroscience topic surged popularity although less established within judgment decision making
notwithstanding tversky kahneman drew piagetian cognitive illusions characterize heuristics biases theories adult judgment decision making only now incorporating developmental results their core assumptions
developmental results inform conceptions whether choices rational adaptive good
results been surprising
knowing children reason rationally classic sense adults forego rational reasoning-which they capable of-in favor heuristics biases casts explanations judgment decision making entirely new light
last topic meaning least established among new trends
nevertheless concept meaning tremendous potential organize thinking about judgment decision making propel field forward new original directions effect practical changes real-world behavior
sunstein advises understanding meaning its malleabilitysuggests some tools policymakers might use p number he exhorts public private institutions employ meaning entrepreneurs move behavior better directions
combining meaning memory development perennially popular topic intuition approached new way
fuzzy-trace theory integrates topics distinguishing between meaning-based memory representations-gist-and superficial verbatim representations information
people use their memories represent information even when information visible
intuition view relies meaning-based gist representations but not developmentally primitive
contrary intuitive thinking underlies most advanced thinking
however intuition produces meaning-based distortions memory reasoning
distortions increase childhood adulthood creating developmental reversals
findings were predicted framework described here but they violate core assumptions other dual-process developmental theories
section below origins i describe how integrated account meaning memory development came about
