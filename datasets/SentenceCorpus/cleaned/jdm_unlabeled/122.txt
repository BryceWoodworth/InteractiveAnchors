 
decision makers often ambiguity averse preferring options subjectively known probabilities options unknown probabilities
ellsberg paradox best-known example phenomenon
ambiguity generally been studied domain risky choice many theories ambiguity aversion deal ambiguity only context
however ambiguity aversion may occur other contexts
present experiment examine effects ambiguity intertemporal choice
subjects imagine they expecting package must choose between two delivery options
some delivery times exact
others ambiguous delivery possible over range dates
problem was structurally identical ellsberg paradox
subjects showed same pattern responses traditional ellsberg paradox each delivery service preferred when was unambiguous option
ambiguity aversion not specific risk but also occur other domains
 introduction 
when faced decision logical first question what will happen if i do
will investment make money
if i get treatment will i get better
frequently not questions answered certainty
thus second question concerns probabilities what chances investment will make money
if i get treatment what probability i will get better
often questions cannot answered any degree certainty either
while sometimes make subjectively good estimates probabilities various outcomes at other times must make decisions under ambiguity decisions feel lack knowledge required subjective estimate probability
many real-world decisions ambiguous
apply expected utility theory eut normative theory risky choice ambiguous situations decision makers must produce subjective estimate absent probabilities regardless whether they feel they sufficient information do so
according expected utility theory decision maker should evaluate gamble multiplying probability each outcome numerical measure goodness outcome utility
sum resulting numbers expected utility gamble decision maker should choose gamble value higher
because derived defensible axioms because no other system will result better aggregate outcomes over time eut considered normative theory decision making
initially was assumed addition being normative eut also described actual decisions
however challenges soon arose suggestion eut descriptive theory choice
one earliest objections was made ellsberg who proposed what now known ellsberg paradox according eut decision maker should choose same outcome both gamble pairs
do otherwise would violate sure-thing principle states changing outcome common two gambles should not change decision maker's preference between them
if decision maker prefers red gamble black gamble pair one implies decision maker thinks there more red balls than black balls
however if there more red balls than black balls there must more total red yellow balls than total black yellow balls decision maker should prefer red gamble black gamble pair two well
symmetrical argument demonstrates decision makers who prefer black gamble pair two should prefer black gamble pair one
adding common outcome winning number if yellow ball drawn should not change whether decision-maker prefers bet red black ball
however ellsberg found decision makers prefer red gamble first pair but prefer black gamble second pair
pattern choices violates sure-thing principle thus inconsistent eut
instead decision maker shows pattern choices displaying ambiguity aversion-in each pair preferring gamble known number balls gambling unknown number
subsequent experiments confirmed ellsberg's intuition both about pattern choices shown ellsberg paradox about ambiguity aversion more generally
ellsberg discussed ambiguity strictly terms risky choice subsequent work generally followed lead ambiguity defined unknown probability probability decision maker feels she does not enough information make subjective estimate
however seems possible ambiguity aversion may more general phenomenon not constrained risky choice
specifically analogous phenomena may occur realm intertemporal choice choices made about outcomes occur at different times
wide variety real-world decisions described intertemporal choices including saving investment decisions preventive health behaviors
example investor must choose between spending small amount money now saving money larger amount money later
many cases length time will pass before receiving outcome cannot estimated any degree accuracy equivalent ambiguous probabilities risky choice
present experiment examines whether effects ambiguity domain delay similar effects ambiguity risky choice
