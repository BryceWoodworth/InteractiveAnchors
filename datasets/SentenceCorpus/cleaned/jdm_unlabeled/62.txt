 
using kahneman tversky's life-death decision paradigm wang colleagues shown two characteristic phenomena regarding people's attitude risk when contextual group size manipulated
both positive negative frames people tend take greater risks life-death decisions contextual group size becomes smaller risk-seeking attitude greater when framed positively than negatively
second characteristic often leads disappearance framing effect small group contexts comprising number number people
their results could shed new light effect contextual group size people's risk choice
however results usually observed laboratory experiments university student samples
study aims examine external validity results through different ways experimentation different sample base
first characteristic was replicated both face-to-face interview randomly selected sample japanese general public web-based experiment non-student sample but not second
 introduction 
over last three decades empirical research human cognition decision-making behavior shown systematic bias number decision-making areas
one pioneering studies field was performed kahneman tversky effects framing life-death decision problems
their study subjects were presented cover story explaining number people were suspected infected fatal asian disease only two curative plans available
specifically plan deterministic outcome while plan b probabilistic outcome
deterministic outcome ensures survival one-third patients i e number survivors while probabilistic outcome results one-third probability all patients will survive two-thirds probability no one will survive
after subjects read cover story they were asked choose one two plans
framing effect demonstrated tversky kahneman follows when problem was represented terms saving lives positive frame most subjects number percent were risk-averse certain survival number lives was more attractive than risky choice there was only one-third chance saving all number lives
contrast when problem was represented terms losing lives negative frame most subjects number percent favored risky choice assured death number people was less attractive than two-thirds probability number could die
number studies been conducted test reliability generalizability tversky kahneman's original study
one hand standard cover story strong framing effects been replicated not only different kinds respondents university faculty staff students physicians but also various applied areas
other hand some studies shown little no framing effect when context cover story was manipulated
apparently framing effect sensitive both context problem described various cognitive social variables
support cognitive social line inquiry series studies wang colleagues observed obvious effect contextual group size people's attitude risk detailed next section
however effect was usually detected experiments university students
thus examine external validity contextual group size effect worth verifying whether effect replicated different method experimentation different sample types
section number will explain wang's effect contextual group size
sections number number report results two experiments verify validity above effect
section number conclude summary discussion results
