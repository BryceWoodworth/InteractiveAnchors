article examines times pattern occurrences where fair biased coin tossed repeatedly
demonstrate due different pattern composition two different statistics mean time waiting time arise same independent bernoulli trials
when coin fair mean time equal all patterns same length but waiting time longest streak patterns
when coin biased both mean time waiting time change more rapidly probability heads streak pattern than non-streak pattern
facts might provide new insight understanding why people view streak patterns rare remarkable
statistics waiting time may not justify prediction gambler's fallacy but paying attention streaks hot hand belief appears meaningful detecting changes underlying process
 introduction 
gambler's fallacy hot hand belief been classified two exemplars human misperceptions random sequential events widely studied multiple disciplines psychology sports behavioral economics neuroeconomics
often manifested more intricate forms two phenomena demonstrated independent identically distributed bernoulli trials
suppose fair coin equal probabilities coming up head h tail t tossed repeatedly first three outcomes produce three heads h h h
predicting next outcome one gambler's fallacy would predict h h h t  reversal streak
contrast one hot hand belief would predict h h h h  continuation streak
fact people exhibit two opposing expectations upon same past information  negative recency gambler's fallacy positive recency hot hand belief  been center attention research perception randomness pattern detection judgment uncertainty
among existing theories prevailing account representativeness heuristic attributes both gambler's fallacy hot hand belief false belief law small numbers
account people tend believe local sample should resemble underlying population chance perceived self-correcting process deviation one direction induces deviation opposite direction restore equilibrium
thus gambler's fallacy tail due reverse streak heads
hot hand belief streak successes may indicate existence hot hand streak tends prolonged
however representativeness account been criticized its incompleteness testability
ayton fischer suggest gambler's fallacy arises experience negative recency sequences natural events roulette games but hot hand belief arises experience positive recency serial fluctuations human performance
similarly been proposed hot hand belief arise when people evaluate performance mutual fund manager rather than fluctuations portfolio gambler's luck rather than outcomes roulette game
moreover burns corpus show subjects assume positive recency forecasting scenarios they rated nonrandom negative recency scenarios they rated random
burns further argues hot hand belief fast frugal heuristic detect changes shooting accuracy basketball players
argument consistent finding residual nonstationarity sun suggested fluctuations players' performance obscured real-time adjustments based detection hot hand
example after making several shots row player might try more difficult shot opponent players may increase defense effort
compared representativeness account alternative interpretations distinguish hot hand belief gambler's fallacy deviations random process
when underlying process truly random statistically impossible tell apart independent stationary bernoulli trials both beliefs considered biases misperceptions randomness
particular both beliefs appear share common intuition streak patterns rare remarkable  streak heads unlikely occur if coin fair basketball player unlikely make shots streaks unless he she hot hand
however independence assumption bernoulli trials states fair coin streak will occur often any other patterns same length its exact order
then what so special about streak patterns people normally tend avoid them only expect them when they feel hot
present paper show streak patterns do possess set properties set them apart other patterns properties may provide alternative explanation particular role streak patterns people's perception judgment randomness
exemplify comparing two patterns h h h t h h h h
when fair coin tossed repeatedly both patterns same probability occurrence any four successive trials
however takes average number tosses encounter first occurrence h h h t but number tosses encounter first occurrence h h h h
other words streak pattern h h h h been delayed its first occurrence
expected number trials required first occurrence particular pattern statistical property known waiting time different among patterns due different pattern compositions
while probability occurrence frequency describes how often pattern occurs waiting time describes when pattern will occur time at monitoring begins
interestingly different statistical properties clearly bear different psychological relevance
example passenger who waiting bus when first bus arrives probably more relevant than how often bus arrives
goal paper demonstrate plausible link between statistics pattern times people's perception randomness
important note concept waiting time recently received attention psychology literature
hahn warren show global sequence moderate length streak patterns h h h h higher probabilities nonoccurrence than h h h t
base result they argue given people's limited exposure environment e g number coin tosses limited misperceptions randomness gambler's fallacy might actually emerge apt reflections environmental statistics
sun tweney wang criticize hahn warren's interpretation clarifying relationship between probability nonoccurrence waiting time
particular sun et al argue probability nonoccurrence manifestation waiting time independent length global sequence neither statistic would justify prediction reverting streak gambler's fallacy
notwithstanding debate argument treating waiting time part environmental statistics appears quite plausible
given different statistics arise same process coin tossing basketball shooting likely they been actually experienced people different effects people's perception randomness
