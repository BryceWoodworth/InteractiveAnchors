prevention behaviors positively framed messages been found elicit stronger behavioral intentions than negatively framed messages
research also seems indicate certain contextual features contribute persuasiveness message
present research test how message framing contextually presented affect number argument factors interact contribute persuasiveness health related message
consistent our hypothesis found our prevention focused task increasing number arguments increased behavioral intentions bi positively framed messages when subjects were cued via negative affect attentive message
resulted significant framing effect messages maximum number arguments negative background picture

 introduction 
persuading people adjust their behavior so more consonant healthy lifestyle no easy matter
health care organizations replete attempts at influencing people live more healthy life
designers health-persuasive messages attempt either encourage more healthy way life discourage unhealthy one
determining how presentational frame message influences individuals particular importance health care since effectiveness intended message direct bearing human health quality life
foundations understanding how problems frame may affect decision choice were laid kahneman tversky's prospect theory
central aspect work people will respond differently depending upon how decision problem presented
specifically decisions may presented manner accentuate either positive gains negative losses aspects task
effect positive negative presentation decision choice referred framing effect
because vast applicability decision framing distinct areas investigation emerged
levin schneider gaeth lsg distinguished between three types framing risky-choice attribute goal framing
because most research health-related choices involves persuasion many health messages categorized goal framing
goal framing refers messages contain arguments describing either benefits adopting gains positive costs not adopting losses negative behavior
distinguishing feature goal framing attempts persuade decision makers adopt specific behavior remains same across frames
consider classic example provided detweiler bedell salovey pronin rothman beachgoers were given message regarding sunscreen use varied only its gain loss frame
both gain loss framed messages promoted same behavior were similar length structure
one gain framed argument was using sunscreen increases your chances maintaining healthy young-looking skin
corresponding loss framed argument stated not using sunscreen decreases your chances maintaining healthy young-looking skin
subjects reported their behavioral intentions use sunscreen via questionnaire actual behavior was measured noting number people each condition who later redeemed coupon sunscreen
consistent their previous research gain framed messages proved elicit greater levels behavioral intention actual behavior
regard health related messages gain-framed messages been found elicit greater behavioral intention bi prevention behaviors while loss-framed messages been found elicit greater bi detection behaviors
prevention behaviors refer those behaviors health-promoting little risk perceived
conversely detection behaviors those behaviors health-detecting infer some amount risk their performance
previously investigated prevention behaviors include sunscreen use condom use smoking cessation
thus relative advantage gain framed messages regard prevention behaviors been well established
while analysis provided levin schneider gaeth provides structure varying types framing does not address potential interactions may exist certain psychological variables
they point out goal frames more complicated than other frames
they also add complication lies how goal framing manipulates several linguistic contextual variations within same task
present paper set out examine two variables identified being particular importance type persuasion task contextually influenced affect number arguments presented
extensive body research examined how affect emotions influence decision making
although many different accounts depict how affect influences information processing subsequent decision choices one explanation affect information account proposed schwarz colleagues
according view negative affect acts signal inform people they may not achieving their desired state goal given task
consequently draws their attention task at hand people become more involved attentive task
other hand positive affect informs people all well they do not need seek out any additional information
result people less attentive tend not seek out additional information task when experiencing positive affect
one way inducing either positive negative affect involves presentation affect laden stimuli background image
supporting affect information view research shown negative images elicit greater attention stronger response than either positive neutral stimuli
prior research investigating persuasive health messages found gain framing elicits greater behavioral intentions tasks focused prevention health related issues task use here
further part persuasiveness message may rest number arguments presented
general persuasiveness should increase number arguments increases
however magnitude effect should determined both attentiveness framing task
if participants not attentive task because positive affect cues then neither frame nor argument number should particularly influential
accordingly predict behavioral intentions should not differ function number arguments when positive background picture present
other hand when context contains negative affect cues decision maker should more attentive task
our prevention task predict gain framed messages persuasiveness should increase number arguments increases
however because negatively framed messages less effective encouraging prevention behaviors suggests decision makers will less involved task when framed negatively
consequently predict number arguments will less influential when problem negatively framed
sum expect increasing numbers arguments should most influential when negative affect cue present messages framed gains
