 
inclusion exclusion strategies allocation scarce goods involve different processes
conditions under one strategy chosen favor other however not been fully explicated
present study decision makers chose single strategy after reading through descriptions number potential organ recipients they then narrowed list transplant candidates
most liberals chose use exclusion under conditions abundance inclusion under scarcity
contrast conservatives preferred inclusion strategy under abundance exclusion though not significantly under scarcity
theoretical implications well ongoing work inclusion-exclusion strategy choice political ideology distributive justice discussed
 introduction 
suppose you were director hospital's organ allocation team
your job determine who among those patients awaiting organ transplants should given priority organs currently available
how would you decide
one possible strategy might decide candidates running
you would select include patients who you think should seriously considered immediate organ transplant
other strategy might decide candidates out running
other words you would eliminate exclude those patients who you think should not seriously considered immediate organ transplant
previous research suggests if you use inclusion rather than exclusion strategy you will end up smaller consideration set i e more candidates will screened out you will expend more effort
research also suggests under certain contexts decision makers may natural preference one strategy over other
