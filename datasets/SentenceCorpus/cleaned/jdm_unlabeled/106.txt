 
waste not want not expresses our culture's aversion waste
i could gotten same thing less sentiment diminish pleasure transaction
study people's willingness pay avoid spoiler
one scenario participants imagined they were looking rental apartment had bought subscription apartment listing
if cheaper subscription had been declined respondents preferred not discover post hoc would sufficed
specifically they preferred ending their quest ideal apartment after seeing more rather than fewer apartments so length search exceeds available within cheaper subscription
other scenarios produced similar results
conclude people may sometimes prefer wasteful order avoid feeling wasteful
 introduction 
recently one our friends was upset
she had just rented perfect little apartment advertised campus bulletin board
but she said i had just paid non-refundable fee apartments listing
now i feel like freier yiddish word roughly meaning patsy sucker pushover
spending more money than necessary regarded wasteful
when not intentional easily avoidable make one feel like freier
admittedly sometimes people overspend deliberately
people show off their wealth shopping wildly expensive places
others flaunt their disregard money lighting up cigars number bills
people also choose generous giving expensive gifts throwing elaborate parties tipping ostentatiously etc
extravagance not equated waste
but when actions self-defined wasteful feeling wastefulness aversive if not more than waste itself
mental accounting provides useful framework understanding waste
if you want new pair jeans number wasteful
but if you want prada jeans number may bargain
please your hosts number wine may adequate
but impress them you should lay out more
when you open mental account enter debit you judge yourself whether resulting outcome was worth
but mental accounting does not explain why feeling waste so aversive
arkes expert psychology waste defined waste two ways
first mentioned above person said wasteful if she spends more money item than necessary
second other side waste utilize item been purchased insufficiently
arkes identified several behaviors driven waste aversion
waste contrary one's economic self-interest oftimes even considered immoral so trying avoid natural
arkes showed moreover even avoid appearance wastefulness italics ours people may motivated make choices compromise their own self-interest
spending too much hurts pocket
appearing spent too much hurts ego
people may willingly overpay economic currencies reduce psychological costs
however losses not one's own fault due e g theft accident market behavior not accompanied second-order pain
thus people may also prefer tolerate additional expenditures time effort pain discomfort etc
if only avoid psychological costs feeling they wasted their money
present study extends waste aversion scenarios where not only self-interest violated but dominance violated well  provided save one feeling like freier
study number establishes phenomenon namely order avoid feeling money was wasted people prefer outcome delivers same result but requires greater expenditure effort time discomfort therefore dominated
study number extends results introducing new dependent variables manipulating proximity protagonist
