 
despite vigorous research risk communication little known about social forces drive choices
erev wallsten neal showed forecasters learn select verbal numerical probability estimates function mode yields average larger group payoffs
extend result investigating effect group size speed forecasters converge better communication mode
basis social facilitation theory hypothesized small groups induce less arousal anxiety among their members than do large groups when performing new tasks therefore forecasters small groups will learn better communication mode more quickly
result obtained experiment number compared groups size number groups size number number
test whether social loafing rather than social facilitation was mediating effects experiment number compared social personal feedback holding group size constant at number members
learning was faster personal feedback condition suggesting social facilitation rather than loafing underlay results
 introduction 
focus research understand some factors affect how forecasters choose communicate risk information others their groups
erev wallsten neal suggested group contexts forecasters selected their communication modes manner best served their group members whole but authors looked only at effects economic consequences
build research investigate effects some non-economic but socially important variables use probabilistic estimates specifically effect group size ease social comparison
erev et al designed experiment inspired tragedy commons individuals acting their own self-interest collectively hurt destroy their society
erev et al asked whether forecasters would select language induced heterogeneous homogeneous behavior decision makers function what best served their group
example roads become congested when everyone drives work at same time
conversely traffic moves smoothly when businesses invoke flex hours
however some cases homogeneous behavior may preferable
example businesses some sectors thrive when they all conform same standards
ask whether forecasters learned choose language induced appropriately heterogeneous homogeneous behavior erev et al designed study two different payoff conditions
one everyone group received payoff when two members group responsible making decisions entire group made same correct choice other condition everyone received payoff when at least one participant made correct choice
addition possible group winnings decision-makers won individual amounts when they were correct
authors assumed number decision-makers make choices they believe maximize their personal chances winning number individuals differ greater degree interpreting verbal than numerical probabilities
basis authors predicted forecasters would learn give verbal judgments when heterogeneous behavior served group's best interests decision-makers acting their self interest would make different choices depending their interpretations verbal terms numerical judgments when homogeneous behavior best served group all decision-makers would make same most likely choice
fact how data turned out
finding suggests forecasters do learn adjust their precision communication response group payoffs
