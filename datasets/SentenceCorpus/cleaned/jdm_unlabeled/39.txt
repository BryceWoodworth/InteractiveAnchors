 
people willing gamble more themselves than what they deem reasonable others
addressed question simplified computer gambling task subjects chose set number cards
subjects selected one card at time after being instructed number cards were good win dollar per card one was really bad lose all money end game
subjects could stop playing at any time collect their winnings
some subjects played game others observed confederate
both groups took risks beyond what was rational i e number cards but textit actors were riskier than textit observers
actor observer asymmetry occurred even after controlling monetary outcome i e having observers win prizes after controlling how question was framed i e asking observers what they themselves textit would do opposed what confederate textit should do
discuss results relation theories decision making emphasize separate contributions rational experiential systems
 introduction 
you at casino watching game black jack when player who hand sixteen asks another card
you quip yourself what idiot
he should held at number
but who's say you wouldn't done same
after all decision making self likely depend cues processes not available when judging choices others
reward having drawn good card prospect winning potential regret overreaching all blunted detached observer
then again you may reach same decision whether you actor observer much information needed including success probability prize size potential loss all available rational choice
example illustrates decision making influenced both rational experiential factors
rational processes effortful logical using cost benefit analysis determine best choice
contrast experiential processes intuitive emotionally-based using heuristics history reward punishment determine next behavior
presumably experiential processes weigh more heavily actors' decisions than observers' judgments
one reason actors may privileged access their own affective reactions
furthermore actors' affective system tapped rewards punishments
contrast observers usually not affected when they influence rewards punishments diminished their being decoupled action
simple terms argued rewarded actions will show tendency repeated
thus occurrence reward should motivate actors repeat rewarded action disregard potential costs beyond what observers would deem reasonable
current study explored specific instance actor observer asymmetry its relation rational experiential dichotomy
used modified version task first developed studying risk taking children
paradigm ten cards were displayed computer screen subjects were told nine cards were good would pay dollar each while one card was disastrous would make them lose all money they had collected thus ending game
subjects turned one card at time decided when stop collect their prize
task could solved deciding advance how many cards turn sequentially deciding whether turn next card
either way expected value task highest turning five cards
thus rational decision maker should stop after turning number cards
two experiments explored possible departures rational decision making whether departures were moderated active task participation
