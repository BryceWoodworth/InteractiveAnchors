binary choice both recommendation modes logically though not psychologically equivalent
report empirical evidence showing speakers recommending preferred options predominantly select positive frames less common when speakers recommend against non-preferred options
addition option attractiveness shown affect speakers' choice frame adoption recommendation mode
results interpreted terms three compatibility effects i recommendation mode-valence framing compatibility speakers' preference positive framing enhanced under recommending diminished under recommending against instructions ii option attractiveness-valence framing compatibility speakers' preference positive framing more pronounced attractive than unattractive options iii recommendation mode-option attractiveness compatibility speakers more likely adopt recommending approach attractive than unattractive binary choice pairs
 introduction 
framing effects been much debated ever since tversky kahneman showed preference risk dependent choice alternatives being framed either positive negative terms
evidently choice behavior determined not only inherent value alternative options but also way they described
early framing studies exposed participants vignettes contained text fragments recorded decision makers' corresponding choices
little attention was paid studies source message
reality however message transferred source e g speaker target e g listener
indeed analysis speakers' listeners' perspective central conversational analysis human judgment constitutes essence grice's logic conversation relevance theory
social context decision making therefore crucial when studying framing
understanding pragmatics framing requires not only study decision makers' responses alternative frames but also examination speakers' construction preference among various possible frames
present paper constitutes continuation our previous research employing conversational framework persuasive efficacy speakers listeners was examined
specifically previous research analyzed risky choice framing shown speakers who try persuade listener adopt particular choice alternative possess distinct preference positive over negative framing
judged listeners' responses however inclination use positive frames effective promoting riskless but not risky options
demonstrated empirically incompatibility between speakers listeners was due asymmetry evaluation mode between speakers listeners
speakers jointly i e comparatively assess information persuasive qualities alternative frames
contrast listeners exposed only one frames consequently assess information only separately i e non-comparatively
our earlier research studied frame valence positive vs negative preferences speakers' their effectiveness persuading listeners
specifically examined compatibility between speakers listeners terms frame preferences
present study explore closely related issue valence framing namely manner option recommended
distinction proposed between two general persuasive orientations speakers might adopt recommending preferred choice alternatives recommending against non-preferred choice alternatives
distinction referred recommendation mode
broadly speaking recommending entail drawing attention listing desired attributes thus forming positive orientation
contrast recommending against requires attending unwanted aspects thus forming negative orientation
note present context positive negative orientations should interpreted not just absolute but also relative terms
thus example saying item cheaper than item b implies positive recommendation
