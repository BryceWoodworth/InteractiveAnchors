given effect possible making calorie-dense foods less accessible low-calorie foods more accessible over extended period time would result significant weight loss
 introduction 
obesity detrimental health its prevalence been growing steadily united states elsewhere over recent decades
national health nutrition examination surveys nhanes estimate percentage obese adults between ages number number america increased number number number number number
obesity second-leading cause preventable deaths increases risk coronary heart disease type ii diabetes other serious medical conditions
although there no doubt obesity represents serious health hazard framing problem obesity epidemic misleading
obesity does not two critical properties epidemics number not contagious number its growth over time years decades not rapid s shaped curve but instead very slow steady
most common medical treatment obesity dieting
yet most studies assessing treatment find ineffective
even when dieters lose weight losses rarely maintained
one review even concludes only rate weight regain not fact weight regain question
according gallup polls percentage americans seriously trying lose weight increased between number but americans got heavier nevertheless
promising alternative approach obesity problem not focus blame obese individual but rather focus environment principal treatable cause
recent years group researchers independently advocated focus environment control national waistline
originally proposed hill peters approach been endorsed one form another brownell levitsky rolls rozin et al number wansink young nestle
estimates increase body weight per year americans been computed they vary depending time period measured racial age properties sample
based nhanes cardia data bases annual weight gain estimates american adults vary number number pounds number number kg number number pounds number number kg per year
creeping increase obesity could halted retrospect could been prevented very modest reduction calories range number number kilocalories day depending many factors including assumptions about efficiency extracting energy ingested foods
thus reduction food intake starting twenty years ago number number apples per week number number number oz cokes per week all else equal would completely eliminated growth obesity united states
environmental alternative its most common probably most practical form involves interventions modest but cumulative effects food intake corresponding modest annual gains weight
number environmental interventions been shown decrease food intake meal
best-documented environmental influence portion size
experiments both laboratory real world settings established increasing portion size increases consumption
portion size also been linked bmi differences field studies
french-who consume more total fat slimmer figures than their american counterparts-have systematically substantially smaller portion sizes restaurants food purchased individual portion sizes cookbooks
slimmer status french strongly suggests they eat fewer calories than americans probably part because they consume smaller portion sizes
focus present studies not portion size but influence accessibility meaning ease food item accessed food choice intake
number existing studies implicate accessibility determinant consumption
most operationalize ease access terms proximity i e spatial location translates into effort
early work manipulating effort was motivated schachter's theory obesity predicted obese individuals would reduce intake more than normal weight individuals effort obtain food increased
general manipulations used studies involved substantial differences effort
nisbett showed obese individuals ate fewer sandwiches if they had walk refrigerator get them while normals were unaffected
similarly schachter friedman showed obese individuals consumed less shelled than unshelled almonds but there was no effect normals
schachter friedman handler number showed caucasian patrons eating at chinese restaurant obese patrons were less likely use chopsticks presumably require more effort than normal weight patrons
another study supporting schachter view was demonstration obese individuals eat fewer cashews when they individually wrapped normals do not but study also found no reduction either group wrapped versus unwrapped chocolates
other studies testing schachter hypothesis show no differences environmental influence obese versus normal subjects
levitz meyers stunkard coll showed reduction low-calorie dessert consumption when they were placed at back four row deep dessert display opposed front cafeteria setting
neither study reported difference between obese normal weight persons
levitz also reported when lid was ice cream cooler cafeteria setting reduced ice cream intake substantially both obese normal weight individuals
studies done outside schachter framework also show effects effort accessibility
meiselman et al reported large decreases intake potato chips candy cafeteria setting when they were made quite inaccessible locating them some distance main serving line
engell et al found individuals drink more water while eating if water pitcher table versus number number feet away
more recently wansink painter lee demonstrated secretaries consume more candy when bowl their desk opposed at another location room
access potentially operationalized subtler ways examples include changing proximity matter inches i e changing ease food reached how much what direction one must stretch reach changing ease transfer i e how easy move food serving location plate mouth
work levitz meyers stunkard coll referred above suggests modest changes positioning foods influence food intake
all successful manipulations accessibility referred here were shown effective single meals
do not know whether people would compensate reduction intake subsequently increased food intake decreased exercise changes efficiency utilization energy
addressed discussion
present studies explore effects small usually unnoticed environmental changes
changes called nudges because they subtly encourage consumption less calorie-dense food without altering choice set
hence our title nudge nobesity i
companion paper nudge nobesity ii instantiates nudges manipulating order presentation items menu real world setting reports increased intake items presented at top bottom food category list opposed middle positions
operationalize accessibility proximity i e requiring longer shorter reach three studies fourth study operationalize ease transfer i e how easy move food one location another
