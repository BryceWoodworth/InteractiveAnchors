results four major german elections show mere recognition party names forecast parties' electoral success fairly well
recognition-based forecasts were most competitive other models when forecasting smaller parties' success small sample sizes
however wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts outperformed recognition-based forecasts most cases
seems wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts able draw benefits recognition while at same time avoiding its downsides lack discrimination among very famous parties recognition caused factors unrelated electoral success
yet seems simple extension recognition-based forecasts-asking people what proportion population would recognize party instead whether they themselves recognize it-is also able eliminate downsides
 introduction 
trouble free elections you never know who going win former political leader soviet union leonid brezhnev supposed said once
did not only bother brezhnev but also keeps polling agencies busy around world
they usually rely intention-based election forecasts generated interviewing large representative samples citizens about their voting intentions
instance germany potential voters typically asked political party they will vote upcoming election
resulting responses used extrapolate likely election results
here investigate how far one get much simpler almost naive method does not require large representative samples
specifically test how well citizens' memories they heard party name before citizens' mere recognition party names allows forecasting outcomes major political elections
compare performance recognition-based election forecasts computed small unrepresentative convenience samples citizens other forecasting methods including i traditional polls computed large representative samples citizens' voting intentions ii simple-but typically very accurate-forecasting method builds aggregated judgments many wisdom crowds
article structured follows
first review previous research showing recognition allows making accurate forecasts many domains
second explain why recognition could accurate predictor variable forecasting elections why recognition-based election forecasts could particularly useful forecasting smaller political parties' electoral success
third introduce election forecasts based wisdoms crowds
