 
group-diffusion effect tendency people judge themselves less likely experience negative outcome total number people exposed threat increases  even when probability outcome explicitly presented
experiment number replicated effect two health threat scenarios using variant yamaguchi's original experimental paradigm
experiment number showed people also judge themselves less likely selected lottery number people playing lottery increases
experiment number showed explicitly presenting number people expected selected eliminates group-diffusion effect experiment number showed presenting number expected affected health threat without presenting total number exposed threat produces reverse effect
propose therefore group-diffusion effect related ratio bias
both effects occur when people make risk likelihood judgments based information presented ratio
difference group-diffusion effect occurs when denominator relevant ratio more salient than numerator while ratio bias occurs when numerator more salient than denominator
 introduction 
many situations there safety numbers
person group less susceptible wide variety threats than person who alone
consider example traveler who walking strange city at night
if person group he she probably less likely get lost less likely mugged more likely receive help event he she twists ankle
however there many other kinds threats being part group makes no difference
imagine example traveler who eats at local restaurant
if food restaurant were found contaminated e
coli then person would just likely get sick after dining group after dining alone
there evidence however people tend confuse latter type situation former
people sometimes perceive illusory safety numbers
first demonstration effect yamaguchi presented college students one six scenarios they were exposed threat e g carcinogen financial risk asked them judge probability they would experience associated negative outcome
one his scenarios example read follows
infectious disease prevalent foreign city
disease comprises fever temperatures over number degrees more than week together severe diarrhea
although death rate not high disease after-effects total hair loss
city authorities afraid losing tourists abroad kept matter confidential
group number japanese tourists including yourself arrived city plan stay one week
how likely do you think you will catch disease if you stay planned one week
each scenario there was alone condition participant was exposed threat alone you arrived city small-group condition participant was one number people exposed large-group condition anywhere number number million people were exposed depending scenario
across all scenarios there was strong tendency participants give lower probability judgments number people exposed threat increased
furthermore function relating group size perceived risk was roughly logarithmic
there was large drop perceived risk alone small-group condition smaller drop small-group large-group condition
yamaguchi referred group-diffusion effect he proposed occurs because people use interdependence heuristic
they apply general rule i am safer larger group even when group size irrelevant
according yamaguchi interdependence heuristic could evolved cognitive concomitant motivational mechanisms lead humans  many other animals  form maintain social groups
course mechanisms evolved because there often safety numbers
individuals groups better able fend off attacks find mates find create shelter forage successfully
but group-diffusion effect result over-applying generally useful rule
our purpose conducting present research group-diffusion effect was twofold
first wanted replicate because there been only two published studies since yamaguchi's was conducted japan
one replicated basic effect hong kong
other was only partially successful replicating effect united states group-diffusion effect being observed only two six scenarios tested
results leave open possibility  yamaguchi himself pointed out  culture might play role group-diffusion effect
because both japan hong kong culturally more collectivist than united states participants those countries might more attentive number people exposed threat more likely apply interdependence heuristic perhaps because their greater sense collective control opposed individual control
important therefore replicate group-diffusion effect individualistic culture united states
our second purpose conducting research was consider alternative explanation group-diffusion effect
specifically thought might result people's attending weighting number people exposed risk more heavily than other information making their likelihood judgments
consider two scenarios
one number person expected taken ill out number people exposed virus
other number people expected taken ill out number people exposed
probability any individual will taken ill given ratio number people expected affected number people exposed course two probabilities example same number number number number number percent
however if people attend weight number people exposed denominator fraction more than number expected affected numerator then they would perceive lower risk when number people exposed number than when number
note there no motivational component our theory
people do not attend weight denominator more than numerator because makes them feel safe
they attend weight more because more attentionally salient
potential problem idea there considerable research phenomenon called ratio bias seems show just opposite
when reasoning about likelihoods based ratios people attend weight numerators more than denominators
example denes-raj epstein asked people choose between two gambles
one they would win if they selected red jelly bean bin containing number jelly beans where one them was red
other they would win if they selected red jelly bean bin containing number jelly beans where between number number them were red
surprisingly many people preferred select second bin implying they were focusing greater number red jelly beans bin
yamagishi shown something similar domain risk perception
his participants judged riskiness various causes death when death rates were presented ratios they appeared attend weight numerators more than denominators
example they judged risk dying cancer greater when told kills number number people out number number than when told kills number number people out number
ratio bias also been shown influence elicitation health-state utilities perceived guilt defendant based dna evidence
our proposal however although people attend weight numerator more than denominator many situations they do opposite others
furthermore mainly consequence relative salience numerator denominator
terms classic jelly bean scenario been used demonstrate ratio bias people might exhibit group-diffusion effect  judging likelihood selecting red jelly bean lower when there number jelly beans bin than when there number  if their attention drawn primarily total number jelly beans rather than number red ones
one way do might present number red jelly beans implicitly rather than explicitly giving total number jelly beans along probability selecting red one number percent
consider analogous situation described following letter popular media columnist who answers people's mathematical scientific technical questions
family friends ganged up me but agree believe what you say
i say odds winning six-number lottery you choose numbers same whether number number number tickets sold
they say chances better if only number sold
who's right
although chances winning same regardless how many tickets sold letter writer's family friends appear influenced number  perhaps because most salient one presented explicitly scenario
scenarios used yamaguchi similar our hypothetical jelly bean example lottery example above they seem draw attention denominator relevant ratio  number people exposed threat
while all six yamaguchi's scenarios prominently featured number people exposed threat none them explicitly presented number people expected affected
one his scenarios probability negative outcome was presented e g number percent chance developing cancer but given difficulty people understanding single-event probabilities seems likely number exposed threat remained highly salient piece information  certainly more salient than non-presented implicitly presented number people expected affected
similar ideas been explored other researchers although not connection group-diffusion effect
example stone et al speculated greater impact certain graphical risk communication methods occurs because graphical methods emphasize number people expected affected more than number exposed
example bar graph compared gum-disease risk associated two brands toothpaste terms number people expected affected produced relatively large differences what people were willing pay two products
however stone et al found stacked bar graph shows both number expected affected total number who use each toothpaste produced much smaller differences par differences produced presenting risks terms probabilities
bonner newell however found no effect conceptually similar manipulation
they presented people information about various causes death terms number people who die per day cause number who die per year
example frequency death cancer australia was presented number deaths per day number number deaths per year
essence ratios number deaths numerator time period denominator
researchers also included condition number deaths numerator was made more salient e g number people australia die every day cancer
condition time frame denominator was made more salient every day australia number people die cancer

consistent research ratio bias they found most people rated causes death riskier per-year condition than per-day condition  minority showing opposite effect
salience manipulation however had no effect
began our research replicating group-diffusion effect college students united states two health scenarios sure occurs participants more individualistic culture
continued replicating again experiment number but new context
instead health-threat scenarios used lottery scenarios participants had chance lose win money
our rationale was if participants exhibited group-diffusion effect positive outcome i e winning money then unlikely effect result interdependence heuristic applied response threat
result would consistent however idea people simply attend weight denominator relevant ratio more than numerator
experiment number show group-diffusion effect eliminated when change scenarios slightly include explicit presentation numerator relevant ratio well denominator
finally experiment number show explicitly presenting numerator but not denominator produces effect opposite direction  ratio bias
all results consistent our proposal group-diffusion effect result people's attending weighting denominator relevant ratio more than numerator
