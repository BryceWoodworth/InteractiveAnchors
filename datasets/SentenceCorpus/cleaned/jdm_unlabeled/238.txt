 
people overestimate their affective reactions future events decisions  phenomenon been termed impact bias
evidence suggests completing diary detailing events contemporaneous focal one de-biases judgments affect
generally assumed because diary completion helps people realize they will distracted focal event
however there another possibility de-biasing may occur because diary completion interferes processing responsible bias
first experiment showed diary completion also lowers affect associated past decisions
second experiment showed solving anagrams same effect
third experiment demonstrates not because affect judgments influenced mood changes brought about solving anagrams
indeed monitoring moods lowered affect same way diary completion
appears cognitive tasks any sort interfere processing required judgments affect
 introduction 
recent evidence suggests people estimate their affective reactions future events will more intense than they actually
misjudgments been termed impact bias
wilson et al suggested psychological mechanism underlies phenomenon what they termed focalism
wilson et al 's words when people generate predictions about how they will feeling after future event people focus too much event question not enough consequences other future events
focalism also been found influence people's judgments their affective reactions past events
example mitchell et al found people's retrospective judgments enjoyable events bicycle trips vacations were more positive than their judgments were contemporaneous events
been suggested retrospective focalism arises same reason prospective focalism people pay too much attention focal event not enough consequences other events occur at same time focal event
wilson et al demonstrated asking people complete diary activities they expected engaged around time focal event reduced intensity emotions associated event
they argued diary manipulation had its effect reducing focalism specifically they suggested effect diary completion reduce extent people expect thinking about focal event after occurred
they suggested effect could brought about one two ways
first asking people complete diary may make them realize other events would occupy their thoughts thereby distract them thinking about target event
result they would ensure they moderated their affective forecasts
second people may focus their attention affective consequences other events rather than likelihood being distracted those events
other words they may believe affective consequences focal event will diluted cancelled out affective consequences other events occurring around same time
result they attenuate their affective forecasts focal event
fact wilson et al found affective valence events participants' diaries had no effect level affect was forecast focal event
consequently researchers concluded affective competition hypothesis was not viable distraction hypothesis provided more plausible account their diary manipulation
here two aims
first aim investigate whether diary completion attenuates retrospective judgment post-decisional affect i e regret disappointment well prospective judgments affect
second aim investigate adequacy distraction account account defocusing both retrospective prospective judgments
particular shall contrast task interference account
according alternative view defocusing occurs because processing subserving affect assessment impaired costs associated task-switching
more specifically judgments affect associated particular event likely involve cognitive processes operate contents working memory
requiring people perform additional task diary completion disrupts processes because makes its own demands working memory
