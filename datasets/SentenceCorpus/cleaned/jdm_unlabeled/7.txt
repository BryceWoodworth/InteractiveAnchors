 
environmental events natural disasters may influence public's affective reactions decisions
shortly after number tsunami disaster assessed how affect elicited thinking about disaster influenced risk perceptions future time perspective swedish undergraduates not directly affected disaster
experimental manipulation was used increase salience affect associated disaster
study number found participants reminded about tsunami had sense their life was more finite included fewer opportunities than participants control condition not reminded about tsunami
study number found similar effects risk perceptions
addition showed manipulations ease-of-thought influenced extent affect influenced risk perceptions greater ease thoughts being associated greater perceived risks
 introduction 
major societal events natural disasters terrorist attacks influence our thoughts feelings
face major environmental event many people tend react emotion emotion-laden decisions
number east asian tsunami disaster had profound psychological impact many countries not only those were directly hit tsunami waves
sweden pop number million had unusually high number tourists visiting area at time disaster resulting over six hundred swedes being killed missing
tsunami disaster was therefore considered major national tragedy sweden
consequence tragedy media attention received was many swedes felt deeply involved saddened
feelings elicited event may also impact everyday decisions
previous research judgment decision making shown preferences constructed basis various contextual factors people tend rely their affective reactions when making decisions
affect defined here specific quality goodness badness experienced feeling state without awareness demarcating positive negative quality stimulus
reliance feelings judgment decision making earlier been described affect heuristic
most previous research affect decision making focused integral affect
however many judgments other sources affect also present
large number studies shows affective states unrelated judgmental target influence judgments decisions nonetheless
famous example johnson tversky found incidental affect i e mood state induced reading newspaper article influenced subsequent risk judgments
however effect incidental affect judgments not stable unchangeable unavoidable fact should rather seen constructive process where individual tries determine if their affective reactions target reliable relevant source information
at core argument lies notion when asked make evaluative judgment individuals seek information determine how they should make judgment
people tend use whatever information available them at time making decision
absence other relevant more salient information people use their affective reactions target evaluate object
people positive moods tend evaluate objects more favorably than participants negative mood
one important point here people incorrectly attribute their incidental moods reaction target
misattribution corrected changed introducing information questions diagnostic value affective reaction judgment
instance schwarz clore's study participants were given simple reminder about cause sunny vs cloudy weather their moods resulted mood no longer influencing judgments well-being
importantly though was diagnostic value affective reaction judgment task not affective reaction itself was affected manipulation
incidental mood only one many sources experiential information used judgments
meta-cognitive experience ease fluency information processing been shown important experiential factor informing judgments decisions
study effect fluency decision making participants were more likely defer choice when they generated more reasons making choice
studies perceptual fluency subjective ease perceptual processing found if color statement printed makes easy read impact perceived truthfulness statement
thus schwarz notes seems subjective experiences accompany our thought processes informative their own right
consequently meta-cognitive feelings may further modulate impact affect judgments
supporting study lerner gonzalez showed fluency manipulations influenced effect specific emotions risk perception
conceptual model guiding research described following way number expect major environmental events natural disaster may influence experienced affect even among individuals not directly affected disaster number experienced affect will turn impact various affective cognitive judgments number effects affect incidental judgment task diminished introducing information fluency manipulations questions diagnostic value experienced feelings judgments
specifically tested prediction affect elicited thinking about recent major natural disaster would influence judgments well-being future pessimistic optimistic thinking mood-congruent manner
previous research documented effects laboratory-induced mood using standardized mood induction procedures autobiographical recall affect-inducing scenarios
extended research inducing affect through procedure participants were asked think about recent relevant major environmental disaster
our research strategy compared ratings affect ratings future personal societal events two groups participants one reminded about tsunami control group
hypothesized reminding participants about tsunami would elicit negative affect associated event
further anticipated affect would spill over judgments well-being well optimistic pessimistic thinking
study number participants both conditions completed measure future pessimism future time perspective ftp scale lang carstensen number rated their well-being
ftp scale was originally developed individual difference measure perceived time remaining life
study number used ftp scale dependent variable expected find individuals reminded about tsunami perceived life more finite limited than participants control condition
study number half participants tsunami-remind condition were given additional experimental manipulation
participants then made risk estimates various future positive negative events
