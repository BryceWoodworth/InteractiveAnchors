 
most prior research compromise effect focused single rather than multiple choices
research investigates potential effects purchase quantity compromise effect
propose share middle option trinary choice set decreases purchase quantity increases because people tend employ balance heuristic distribute their multiple choices among available options achieve balanced state satisfy their variety-seeking tendency
furthermore propose need justification optimal stimulation level moderate relationship between number purchase items compromise effect
proposed hypotheses supported results three experiments
 introduction 
consumers motivated minimize expected losses resolve decision conflicts their decision-making process
when comes making choice consumers tend avoid extreme options attractive some ways but unattractive others
rather they more likely choose middle option because may seen least extreme choice
choice strategy prevents consumers having give up any favorable attributes other products
consumers justify decision easily arguing chosen product combines attributes other two
accordingly compromise effect occurs when likelihood one option will chosen over its alternative enhanced introduction third option makes first option appear middle option
concept compromise effect been shown theoretically practically robust many fields including business-to-business group decision making technology markets culture difference
most prior research compromise effect focused choice single unit during purchase specific product largely ignored multiple-unit purchase decisions
yet consumers often purchase multiple units product category single occasion
instance they may buy several bottles orange juice at once
given choice among three available brands juice-a b c high trade-off attributes-and assuming brand b middle option will purchase quantity change their choice behavior favor middle option
specifically will they buy middle compromise option predicted compromise effect theory will they purchase every available option
purchase quantity increases consumers may find choosing only one option multiple units may ironically heighten decision risk instead reducing therefore they may forfeit their choice compromise option favor strategy diversification
one distinct aspect purchasing multiple units several available alternatives enables consumers distribute their choices among different options
distributability choices among several options allows consumers diversify associated risks obtain satisfaction buying variety options
people predicted balance theory apt achieve state balance order harmony their lives
distributing multiple units among all alternatives helps people reach balanced state also facilitates diversification decision risk
hence compromise effect may different multiple-unit purchase than single-unit purchase
moreover multiplicity available options offers consumers opportunity demonstrate their variety-seeking tendency person's inherent preference variety novelty
variety-seeking tendency may emerge when people need minimize expected losses resolve decision conflicts save their efforts
since variety-seeking tendency induces people assign their choice multiple units among available alternatives may weaken compromise effect
past research suggested purchase quantity may affect compromise effect because people may prefer make choices minimize losses resolve inner conflicts when making multiple choice decisions
consumers sometimes need provide reasons their choices
need justification assumed exercise positive influence compromise effect because focus decision shifts choice good options choice good reason selecting option
compromise option seems logical when purchasing single unit but may not seem plausible choosing only compromise alternative all multiple units
hence having make several choices among multiple options weakens offsets positive impact decision justification
finally availability variety alternatives advantageous consumers' choices far their optimal stimulation level osl concerned
osl refers level stimulation consumers want reach response environmental stimuli
when stimulation received diversity novelty ambiguity complexity below optimal level people attempt increase stimulation when above optimal level they inclined reduce
therefore if choosing compromise option all multiple units cannot provide enough stimulation consumers they may allocate some purchased units alternatives other than compromise one
sum study explores how purchase quantity affects compromise effect
hypothesize compromise effect dampened when purchase quantity increases particularly when people attempt justify their choices
furthermore suggest impact compromise effect mediated balance tendency computed formula balance index derived concept balance deviation
