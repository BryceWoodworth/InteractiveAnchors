 
ambiguity aversion been widely observed individuals' judgments
using scenarios typical decision analysis investigate ambiguity aversion pairs individuals
examine risky cautious shifts individuals' original judgments their judgments when they paired up dyads
our experiment participants were first asked specify individually their willingness-to-pay six monetary gambles
they were then paired at random into dyads were asked specify their willingness-to-pay amount same gambles
dyad's willingness-to-pay amount was shared equally two individuals
six gambles our experiment one involved no ambiguity remaining five involved different degrees ambiguity
found dyads exhibited risk aversion well ambiguity aversion
majority dyads exhibited cautious shift face ambiguity stating smaller willingness-to-pay than two individuals' average
our study thus confirms persistence ambiguity aversion group setting demonstrates predominance cautious shifts dyads
 introduction 
much theoretical experimental research decision analysis examined how individuals do should make choices set prices they willing pay risky ambiguous options
but not much focus been placed decisions made groups though group decisions common
would helpful understand relationship between individual decisions group decisions first examining simplest setting pricing lottery
start direction primary question address here via experiment when decision makers act two-person group called dyad' do they exhibit more less ambiguity aversion than observed individual settings
note some situations forecasting e g delphi technique two heads indeed better than one
context monetary policy blinder morgan find groups make better decisions than individuals
therefore natural examine how decisions under ambiguity differ when made individually versus when made dyads
many real world decisions entrusted groups hope collective wisdom will prevail
will individuals our scenarios share their knowledge see light probability winning due construction our scenarios at least number number therefore become less ambiguity averse
risk aversion consistent rational decision making been observed variety settings
evidence ambiguity aversion been mixed
raiffa argued rational decision maker should not ambiguity averse
fox tversky found ambiguity aversion disappears when individuals evaluate single gamble non-comparative setting chow sarin found ambiguity aversion reduced when making separate evaluations
sarin weber found market settings ambiguity aversion reduced independent auctions but not simultaneous auctions
at least two reasons expect less ambiguity aversion thus higher prices dyads
first two people face-to-face discussion may more fully understand ambiguous setting they facing
because our subjects know our scenarios they choose either side bet discussion between two subjects may lead realization probability winning at least number number
second individual blame regret should moderated group setting
