 
previous research demonstrates overestimation rare events judgment tasks underweighting rare events decisions experience
current paper presents three laboratory experiments field study explore pattern
results suggest overestimation underweighting pattern emerge parallel
part difference between two tendencies explained product contingent recency effect although estimations reflect negative recency choice behavior reflects positive recency
similar pattern observed field study immediately following aversive rare-event i e suicide bombing people believe risk decreases negative recency but at same time exhibit more cautious behavior positive recency
rest difference consistent two well established mechanisms judgment error use small samples choice
implications two-stage choice model discussed
 introduction 
studies human reaction low probability rare events reveal interesting difference between judgment decision-making repeated settings
judgments probability estimations appear reflect over-sensitivity rare events
estimated probability events occur probability below number number tends higher than objective probability
other hand decision-making experience tends reflect underweighting insensitivity rare events
decision-makers behave if events occur probability below number number occur smaller probability than their objective probability
apparent discrepancy important light two-stage choice model assumes choice predicted estimated probabilities
