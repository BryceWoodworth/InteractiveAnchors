contrary expectations results were largely inconsistent uncertainty account under low penalty delay did not depend information certainty under high penalty delay rate was actually much lower when information was uncertain

 introduction 
pending decisions how much attribute information should decision maker gather before eventually committing choice alternative
common dilemma much relevant information exists world yet some will not ultimately affect one's choice
term information instrumentality refers whether not some attribute information could actually alter choice preference reasonable strategy wait only instrumental information
contrast strategy however typical decision maker been shown delay choice obtain noninstrumental information
been documented bastardi shafir across wide range decision situations including consumer choice applicant selection ultimatum games everyday contexts
example was found when hypothetical course was going taught either very popular instructor less popular one but was not yet known instructor would teaching majority individuals postponed choice
missing information was noninstrumental was illustrated fact when less desirable instructor was known outset teaching course no opportunity defer was available individuals overwhelmingly chose enroll course
interest here why choice delay occurs context noninstrumental information research present speaks important question
particular individuals actually waiting information per se
they waiting other reasons
bastardi shafir proposed individuals wait specifically obtain noninstrumental information phenomenon emerges because information uncertainty obscures decision makers' true preference
rather than try resolve their preference decision makers postpones choice hope any additional information will clarify situation refer attribute uncertainty account
tykocinski ruffle contrast developed alternative account refer here confidence account
account waiting occurs gain not information face uncertainty but rather gain confidence non-ideal alternative through deliberation occur even when all information known
consistent their account they found choice delay occurred even when decision makers knew outset less desirable attribute favored option had already become available some cases rates deferral certain condition were found high those uncertain one
furthermore they found less confident decision makers were their initial preference well longer stated delay period day week more likely they were postpone choice
there currently limited mixed evidence regarding influence information uncertainty source choice delay above beyond low confidence
because only tykocinski ruffle used control condition could discriminate between accounts extent attribute uncertainty underlies delay behavior across range contexts remains largely unclear
expand breadth contexts sources delay explored further evaluate evidence attribute uncertainty account relative low confidence account present research considers delay behavior situations there some external reason not postpone choice relative those little reason not delay
introduction penalty delay ecologically important one penalties abound everyday experience e g hold fees consumer purchases charges running internet searches information risk course filling all available seats full account delay behavior should able accommodate data context penalties
more central present work context methodologically interesting desire avoid delay penalties motivate people make more serious attempts at resolving choice difficulties than they might otherwise do
result not only does introduction penalty manipulation potential extend noninstrumental information effect high penalty context but also potential dissociate two sources delay
particular large penalty might produce greater decreases confidence-related delay than attribute uncertainty because confidence-related delay arguably easier resolve under pressure because preference already known than delay driven attribute uncertainty
conducted two experiments delay behavior context noninstrumental information manipulating both presence significant penalty delay information certainty
experiment number course registration scenario penalty manipulation involved risk participants were informed either there was high risk loss course alternative over time risk was minimal
experiment number consumer purchase scenario penalty manipulation instead involved cost participants were informed either high negligible cost put item hold
both experiments uncertain information condition value noninstrumental attribute information would not known until next day certain information condition was known least desirable value
tykocinski ruffle reasoned delay certain condition consistent confidence source delay although any additional delay uncertain condition reasonably attributed attribute uncertainty expected evidence both sources each level penalty
assuming evidence two sources delay further predicted penalty manipulation would reveal dissociation between strategies namely disproportionate decrease delay certain condition where low confidence only source delay grounds might easier resolve choice difficulty when at least tentative preference been identified than when none been selected
