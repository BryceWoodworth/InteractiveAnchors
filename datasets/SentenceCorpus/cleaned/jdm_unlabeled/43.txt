 introduction 
throughout our lives gamble
some gambles explicit like horse races lottery tickets
others like purchasing house getting plane getting married more implicit
once either chosen received gamble await outcome
would willingly exchange one gamble another would rather stick what got simply because ours fear tempting fate
imagine example you received lottery ticket sealed envelope
you then offered number bonus exchange your ticket another ticket identical distribution
what would you do
rational thing exchange tickets since ticket-plus number more valuable than ticket
but would you
would your decision exchange different if ticket was not sealed envelope
endowment effect literature would predict people would not willing exchange due loss experienced giving up pre-owned object
however trade between identical goods should not evoke loss indeed most people would exchange example one pen identical pen one candy identical one when offered small incentive do so
contrast people generally reluctant exchange lottery tickets identical distribution i e tickets equal chance winning even when offered incentive do so
according bar-hillel neter anticipation ex-post regret exchanging ticket losing lottery prevents people exchanging
understanding willingness exchange gambles important since many our everyday choices represented such-purchasing insurance purchasing new innovative products going unfamiliar restaurant choosing seat plane
example going unfamiliar restaurant ordering exotic non-traditional entree one gambling quality food nature experience restaurant
once people chosen gamble let restaurant entree insurance plan would they reluctant trade them they would when offered trade other goods
paper investigates potential moderator reluctance exchange gambles namely their vividness
specifically i propose more vivid gambles evoke more thoughts about consequences playing out gamble turn induce greater anticipated regret when offered exchange
when easy imagine consequences gamble e g winning lottery one likely anticipate greater regret exchanging gamble possibly changing consequences gamble e g losing lottery result exchange
result greater anticipated regret reduces likelihood exchanging gambles
example when deciding among unfamiliar restaurants being close restaurant opposed deciding when still at home increases vividness restaurants making regret more salient turn reduces likelihood switching one gamble i e restaurant another even when offered incentive switch e g promotional offer
paper focuses specific type gambles namely lottery tickets
proposed less vivid tickets evoke fewer thoughts about tickets potentially winning lottery make harder imagining ticket winning
result less vivid tickets evoke less anticipated regret exchanging thus possibly losing lottery
reduced anticipated ex-post regret leads turn increased willingness exchange less vivid tickets
next section reviews literature endowment effect regret vividness
then i present three studies test effect ticket's vividness amount nature winning-related thoughts study number willingness exchange tickets studies number number using two types lotteries two manipulations vividness
study number additionally tests mediating role anticipated regret when analyzing effect tickets' vividness willingness exchange them
