several predictions heuristic makes empirical tests predominantly focused proposed noncompensatory processing recognition
some authors emphasized heuristic needs scrutinized based precise tests exclusive use recognition
although precise tests clear merits i critically evaluate value tests they currently employed
first i argue using precise measures exclusive use recognition go beyond showing recognition heuristic-like every model-cannot capture reality completely
second i illustrate how precise tests based response times lead unsubstantiated conclusions if fact recognition heuristic does not model recognition judgment itself ignored
finally i highlight two key but so far neglected aspects recognition heuristic connection between recognition memory recognition heuristic b mechanisms underlying adaptive use recognition
 introduction 
his essays french philosopher michel de montaigne suggested good memory not necessarily coupled good decision making
fact he seems imply decisions sometimes even benefit deficits memory
how could possible
one answer because structures mind often reflect meaningful regularities world blanks memory exploited making inferences about world
notion judgments feed dynamics memory been taken up several models decision making
instance tversky kahneman proposed ease instances occurrences brought mind ecologically valid clue p number about world availability heuristic based ease might operate when people judge probability frequency
more recently goldstein gigerenzer described recognition heuristic model how people recruit recognition memory when making inferences more generally
contrast availability heuristic recognition heuristic clearly specified computational model precise search stopping decision rules
moreover recognition heuristic was proposed adaptive mental tool specific boundary conditions
recognition heuristic makes several testable predictions about recognition its use decision making
first recognition heuristic assumed ecologically rational i e exploiting regularity environment recognition should frequently correlated quantities world
second people's use recognition heuristic should sensitive structure environment
third recognition heuristic predicts recognition processed noncompensatory fashion-that recognition should supersede further cue knowledge
finally heuristic predicts under certain conditions counterintuitive less-is-more effect where recognizing fewer objects lead more accurate inferences than recognizing more objects
precise definition recognition heuristic its assumed role adaptive mental tool made attractive study object
maybe not surprisingly not all empirical investigations found evidence supporting heuristic
several predictions heuristic makes seems fair say assumed noncompensatory processing recognition received greatest attention so far-and generated strongest objection
some authors emphasized need precise tests recognition heuristic developed precise measures exclusive use recognition arguing precise models deserve precise measures b conducted precise tests information processing recognition-based inference based response times
following i discuss value precise tests they currently used argue they done little advance our understanding recognition-based inference
addition i highlight two key issues underlying use recognition decision making seem been neglected result strong focus testing noncompensatory processing recognition
first need better understand relationship between recognition studied memory literature recognition memory tapped recognition heuristic
second i summarize proposals how people might adaptively adjust their reliance recognition across different situations
importantly i do not argue developments precise measures demonstrations recognition heuristic's failure predict data should ignored
rather i call more constructive way use findings refining models memory-based decision making
