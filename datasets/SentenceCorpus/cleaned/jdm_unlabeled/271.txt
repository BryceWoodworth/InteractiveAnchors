one key feature genetic testing counseling provision personal lifetime risk
however little attention been paid how women interpret lifetime risk information despite fact they base screening treatment family planning decisions information
study vital issue set out test ability women choose most appropriate interpretation national cancer institute's nci message about lifetime risk developing cancer woman altered brca number brca number genes
participants included number women who had not undergone genetic testing had cancer number women who had undergone genetic testing had cancer
over number percent women who had not undergone genetic testing had cancer number percent those who had undergone genetic testing had cancer misunderstood nci's information
furthermore line growing body research found high numeracy level objective subjective positively associated woman's ability correctly interpret nci's message
 introduction 
genetic screening brca number brca number  gene mutations associated higher risk developing breast ovarian cancers  gives women shot at early detection surveillance intervention
one key feature genetic counseling process provision personal lifetime risk  risk developing specific disease during one's lifetime
indeed both patients genetic counselors rate communication lifetime risk information pivotal part process
not surprising women who test positive brca number number often rely lifetime risk estimates make future family plans decide whether undergo mastectomy despite being cancer free
given importance lifetime risk information researchers been interested whether women overestimate underestimate their lifetime risk developing cancer
others investigated relationship between risk perception emotional reaction well between risk perception mammography screening whether leaflets genetic testing risk counseling improve women's accuracy estimating their lifetime risk developing cancer
although earlier studies examined women's estimation their lifetime risk more fundamental issue how women interpret lifetime risk information
after all if women misunderstand meaning lifetime risk whether they overestimate underestimate incorrectly interpreted risk would less important
indeed research shown people interpret numerical probabilities multiple mutually contradictory ways
researchers demonstrated individuals interpret seemingly unambiguous statement there number percent chance rain tomorrow different ways will rain tomorrow number percent region number percent time number percent days like tomorrow
since people misconstrue common mundane probabilistic information interpreting probabilistic information like lifetime risk developing cancer proves even greater challenge given added emotional impact
authors' knowledge however no previous studies examined how women interpret statements regarding their lifetime risk developing cancer what variables e g numeracy might affect women's ability correctly interpret information
growing corpus research shown numeracy  ability understand basic mathematical concepts  important quality decisions
accordingly researchers long argued numeracy levels play key role host medical decision making might influence way people perceive understand risk
recent review summarized idea well low numeracy pervasive constrains informed patient choice impairs risk communication affects medical outcome
while data strongly indicate existence relationship between numeracy medical decision making whether numeracy levels affect women's ability interpret lifetime risk data still unanswered question
light abovementioned research gap existing literature set out examine two related hypotheses
first predicted statement about lifetime risk developing cancer would give rise various interpretations not all would correct
second predicted participants higher numeracy levels will better understanding lifetime risk information than their peers lower numeracy levels
