 introduction 
human decision-making constrained its bounded rationality does not always follow normative prescriptions
nevertheless individual differences cognitive abilities skills predict normatively superior judgment decision-making
variety theories dual-process theories attribute individual differences deliberative processes however link between decision processes abilities largely uninvestigated
what cognitive processes give rise relationship between cognitive abilities superior decision making under risk
previous research examined individual differences decision making under risk lotteries known probabilities
low stakes lotteries normative expected utility processes assumed approximated calculations multiply probabilities potential gains losses i e expected-value calculations
frederick demonstrated expected-value choices associated scores cognitive reflection test designed measure one's reliance more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions
three-problem cognitive reflection test known correlate other general cognitive ability measures consists mathematical problems immediate intuitive response incorrect
frederick demonstrated higher scoring individuals did not exhibit clear non-normative risk asymmetry gains losses predicted prospect theory
when given choice between gain number versus number percent chance number gain prospect theory predicted risk aversion selection certain number
however people higher cognitive reflection scores more often selected options higher expected values i e probability multiplied potential risky gain  number compared lower scoring individuals
there several candidate mechanisms may account link between cognitive abilities superior decision making under risk
example one make expected-value choices performing expected-value calculations
frederick suggests computation expected values may play role although he notes not likely only factor
more generally stanovich west suggest individual differences normative judgments decisions often arise working memory capacity limitations computation implying high ability individuals may make expected-value choices via expected-value calculations
other research indicates individual differences risky decision making may also arise variations one's general knowledge understanding probabilities  i e one's numeracy
people high numeracy particularly ability comprehend transform probabilities less affected attribute framing because they readily transform items number percent correct into number percent incorrect translate percentages frequencies vice versa
