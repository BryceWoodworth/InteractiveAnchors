 
three experiments demonstrate how processing negations contingent evaluation context negative information presented
addition strategy used process negations induced different affective reactions toward stimuli leading inconsistency preference
participants were presented stimuli described either stating presence positive features explicitly positive alternative negating presence negative features non-negative alternative
alternatives were presented either joint je separate evaluation se
experiment number showed non-negative stimuli were judged less attractive than positive ones je but not se
experiment number revealed non-negative stimuli induced less clear less positive feeling when they were paired explicitly positive stimuli rather than evaluated separately
non-negative options were also found less easy judge than positive ones je but not se
finally experiment number showed people process negations using two different models depending evaluation mode
through memory task found je people process non-negative attributes negations negative features whereas se they directly process non-negative attributes positive features
 introduction 
positive qualities stimulus described either direct indirect fashion sometimes difference between two perspectives small subtle
instance if person tells you cereal breakfast not high fat you may either think low fat moderately fatty
therefore above sentence leaves room interpretations since explicitly communicated what not present lot fats but does not tell how lean those cereals
possible evaluation context cereal described may affect way they judged
other words people may evaluate same cereal less attractive if they told cereal brand not high fat cereal brand b fat-free than if they simply told cereal brand not high fat
present paper will show specific context negations processed effect people's inferences about negation meaning their affective reactions turn their preferences
hypothesize affective reactions induced non-negative information e g cereal not high fat contingent evaluation context negation presented
particular aim show effect evaluation context affective reactions induced different ways negations processed depending whether explicitly positive comparison form affirmative sentence present not
inconsistency preference may important implications several domains like instance personnel selection products advertisement
numerous studies last few decades shown strong link between people's affective reactions their subsequent behaviors
therefore if context negation evaluated may influence individuals' feelings then may also affect their actual choices
our hypotheses supported previous work processing negations
there been long debate how negations actually processed whether they increase accessibility information congruent actual state affairs cereal not high fat negated state affairs cereal high fat
debate led elaboration two models offer completely different accounts way negations processed
first model closer explanation offered propositional theories language comprehension
model called schema-plus-tag model
states individuals process negation processing core message schema e g cereal high fat then complete negation tag
stated mayo et al model entails two important implications
first people process core schema attach negation tag therefore allowing dissociation between them at later point time
second implication pertains associations schema activates should congruent negated state affairs high fat instead being consistent actual state affairs not high fat
indeed under schema-plus-tag model people supposed attach negation schema only after schema-congruent associations been activated
consequence they end up understanding negation its meaning but at same time they activate series associations incongruent intended meaning negation
alternatively proposers experiential-simulation model suggested second way process negation fusing negation tag into core schema
case sentence cereal not high fat should processed cereal low fat
main consequence using model fusing negation core concept allows people activate associations congruent actual state affairs
therefore fusion model should reinforce intended meaning message make more convincing
macdonald just proposed mechanism accounts fusion negation tag into core schema
they suggested negation tag should inhibit activation concepts congruent negated state affairs
more recently kaup et al suggested alternative mechanism may account negation tag-core schema fusion process
proposed mechanism entails negated state affairs simulated auxiliary representational system
way representation negated state affairs not integrated representation described world
instead people should able juxtapose two representations so they take into account negated information
other words kaup et al suggested simulation negated state affairs should mentally rejected fact simulated but not integrated representation described world
mayo et al suggested individuals might use either schema-plus-tag model fusion model depending inferences allowed sentence negation included
particular mayo colleagues found existence schema accommodates meaning original negation critical determining how negation will encoded
present study aim show use either one other model may contingent context negation presented
series three studies asked participants judge explicitly positive stimuli characterized having positive features non-negative stimuli characterized not having negative features
participants were presented either one both options thereby using joint je versus separate se evaluation paradigm
previous studies demonstrated numerous ways preferences elicited je se inconsistent
understand kind stimuli used present study consider example cereal presented earlier
both message saying cereal not high fat message saying cereal fat-free communicate similar non-negative value i e both cases cereal does not lot fat positive people's health but different ways
throughout three studies find people presented either one other type description do not necessarily evaluate them equally good their quest healthy food
positive non-negative descriptions lead similar judgments se
however find non-negative description perceived less favorable way than positive description when they presented together
difference appears depend how negation processed joint versus separate evaluation
