 
physicians often encounter diagnostic problems ambiguous conflicting features
what they likely do situations
presented diagnostic scenario number family physicians traced their information gathering diagnoses management
scenario contained ambiguous feature while other features supported either cardiac musculoskeletal diagnosis
due risk death cardiac diagnosis should considered managed appropriately
forty-seven participants number percent gave only musculoskeletal diagnosis number them managed patient inappropriately sent him home painkillers
they elicited less information spent less time scenario than those who diagnosed cardiac cause
no feedback was provided participants
stimulated recall number physicians revealed differences way same information was interpreted function final diagnosis
musculoskeletal group denigrated important cues making them coherent their representation pulled muscle whilst cardiac group saw them evidence cardiac problem
most physicians indicated they were fairly very certain about their diagnosis
observed behaviours described coherence-based reasoning whereby emerging judgment influences evaluation incoming information so confident judgments achieved even ambiguous uncertain conflicting information
role coherence-based reasoning medical diagnosis diagnostic error needs systematically examined
 introduction 
diagnosis chest pain primary care notoriously difficult
cause pain usually not life threatening
however conditions acute coronary syndrome pulmonary embolism may fatal if unrecognised not promptly treated
there evidence myocardial infarction mi may missed primary care
missed mi commonest cause negligence claims against primary care physicians usa relates more deaths than other conditions claims against family physicians uk
epidemiological studies found atypical presentations well patients attributing their symptoms non-cardiac cause significant factors missed diagnoses mi
studied diagnosis atypical chest pain using simulated patient who attributes his pain pulled muscle
scenario described detail later included conflicting features i e some features pointing cardiac diagnosis others pointing musculoskeletal diagnosis
accounts coherence-based reasoning describe how people deal situations what they do order resolve conflict
faced equivocal i e non-diagnostic information about two alternatives people will spontaneously form preference one alternative will distort information received subsequently so favors preferred alternative
they may even distort information clearly favors one alternative order preserve earlier preference other alternative though distortion generally declines diagnosticity information increases
if preferences judgments change result new incoming information distortion continues operate now favor new preference judgment
seems distortion information psychological necessity helps individuals form maintain coherent judgments
parallels medical diagnosis drawn studies legal decision making
simon colleagues gave participants legal case conflicting information i e where each position was supported equal amounts probabilistic evidence asked them render verdict indicate their confidence
they pre-disposed participants either guilt verdict innocence verdict presenting them dna evidence either incriminated exonerated defendant odds number number million dna evidence being wrong
before seeing case participants had been asked rate diagnosticity each piece evidence presented them unrelated vignettes describing various social situations
after they read rendered their verdict legal case participants were asked rate diagnosticity each piece evidence again time presented them context case
new ratings were consistent verdict significantly differed ones made earlier unrelated vignettes
seems whilst evidence was initially perceived truly equivocal non-diagnostic was subsequently contextualised became part mental model legal case
its perceived diagnosticity thus increased line verdict
authors argue dna match should bear no relationship other pieces evidence case reliability eyewitness' identification
nevertherless now perceived related their evaluation shifts support final verdict  what authors call coherence shifts
basic experimental procedure been repeated several variations order test whether different factors affected coherence-based reasoning
coherence shifts were found even when participants were asked simply memorise ambiguous legal case
when they were unexpectedly asked render verdict rate their agreement various arguments case agreement had shifted baseline function final verdict
largest shifts however were observed between baseline interim phase after memorisation but before being asked render verdict indicate leaning towards verdict
findings suggest coherence shifts happen pre-decisionally not simply result decision justification
processing complex legal case contained conflicting arguments intention either make decision later receive further information memorise order communicate someone else resulted comparable coherence shifts
was attributed intense attempt comprehend complex material represent mentally coherent way
pre-decisional distortion information been investigated mostly college students tasks required no prior experience technical skill
professionals people experience specific domain making judgments within their domain expertise rarely studied
one study participants experienced horse race betting evaluated task-related information chances horses winning simulated race accordance their final choice either anticipation having place bet later consequence simply processing task information
they distorted information greater extent than participants without experience betting horses
wanted investigate how physicians deal difficult diagnostic problems contain conflicting information where diagnoses cannot confirmed excluded certainty
diagnosis chest pain primary care lends itself type enquiry
chest pain scenario was one seven scenarios built larger study investigated relationship between experience information search diagnostic accuracy difficult problems family medicine
found across scenarios experience was not related diagnostic accuracy was predicted only number critical cues elicited i e cues diagnostic value relevant differential diagnoses
