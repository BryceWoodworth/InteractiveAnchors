overall findings processes underlie fast frugal heuristic somewhat mixed many studies expressed need considering more compensatory integration recognition information
regardless mechanism involved clear recognition strong influence choices finding might explained fact recognition cues arouse affect thus receive more attention than cognitive cues
test assumption investigated whether recognition results direct affective signal measuring physiological arousal i e peripheral arterial tone established city-size task
found recognition cities does not directly result increased physiological arousal
moreover results show physiological arousal increased increasing inconsistency between recognition information additional cue information
findings support predictions derived compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction model rather than predictions noncompensatory models
additional results concerning confidence ratings response times choice proportions further demonstrated recognition information other cognitive cues integrated compensatory manner
 introduction 
imagine business trip city you never visited before
your meetings end later than you had expected you decide spend night
you make few phone calls find two hotels vacancies both at similar rate
you know nothing else about hotels however you do recognize name one them
hotel would you choose
according goldstein gigerenzer kinds probabilistic inferences could resolved recognition information alone
more specifically according gigerenzer colleagues individuals equipped several tools i e fast frugal heuristics exploit structure environment some rely solely one piece information at time road reaching decision
recognition heuristic rh simplest one most prototypical tools toolbox suggests probabilistic inferences about specific criterion e g two cities more populated made basis recognition alone so recognized objects e g name city will chosen over unrecognized ones
indeed been shown repeatedly people actually prefer recognized objects over unrecognized ones behavior may lead rather accurate inferences
nevertheless several studies challenge claim recognition information used noncompensatory manner predicted rh
example oppenheimer broder eichler richter spath additional information been found affect proportion choices followed recognition
while been argued several studies suffer methodological limitations their findings nonetheless highlight need considering more compensatory integration recognition information
moreover studies rh focused mainly choice behavior
yet since choice predictions made different models often overlap difficult draw clear conclusions concerning underlying cognitive processes
several recent studies attempted address problem example testing hypotheses concerning process measures decision time additionally investigating confidence glockner broder press
yet additional research needed disentangle role recognition information decision making well examine cognitive processes underlying its use inferences choice behavior
achieve goals investigated nature processes underlying use recognition information probabilistic inferences using physiological arousal choice proportions decision times confidence dependent measures
derived concurring predictions basis noncompensatory perspective juxtapose contradicting predictions derived compensatory model
specifically investigate whether recognition leads increased physiological arousal dominates other cognitive information suggested affect-based noncompensatory models
been argued recognition information like other affective signals might generated automatically may override cognitive information
thus examined whether recognition information affectively encoded during decision process
tested rh against compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction pcs model decision making
pcs model was selected because been shown account well decision times confidence glockner broder press recognition tasks because makes specific predictions concerning physiological arousal
pcs model assumes information integration based automatic-intuitive processes  akin perception  consistent interpretations decision tasks constructed
available information taken into account according its importance advantages emerging preferred option highlighted systematic information distortions
formalized pcs model includes four possible steps
first when presented decision task related information activated form mental representation task
second automatic processes pcs lead maximization consistency automatically highlighting information supporting favored alternative at same time suppressing contradicting information
result consistent representation available information formed
third decision maker evaluates choice alternatives if one alternative clearly dominates other i e if there enough information favor alternative alternative chosen
however if information consistency fails reach certain threshold decision maker takes forth step deliberate construction processes activated change structure network e g changing pattern information search assigning different weights different pieces information
among other things pcs model supported research shows unconscious modifications available information occur during decision processes
