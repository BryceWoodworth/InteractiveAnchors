 
many controversies medical science framed tension between coherence approach seeks logic explanation correspondence approach emphasizes empirical correctness
many instances coherence-based theory leads understanding disease not supported empirical evidence
physicians patients alike tend favor coherence approach even face strong contradictory correspondence evidence
examples include management atrial fibrillation treatment acute bronchitis use vitamin e prevent heart disease
despite frequent occurrence controversy stemming coherence-correspondence conflicts medical professionals generally unaware terms philosophical traditions underlie them
learning about coherence-correspondence distinction using best both approaches could not only help reconcile controversy but also lead striking advances medical science
 introduction 
theories truth been debated since time aristotle
more recently twentieth century philosophical discussion focused distinction between coherence correspondence theories truth
coherence approach seeks logic explanation often through application scientific theory
correspondence approach ignores theory favor empirical correctness
example quality weather forecast predicting rain might judged either regard state-of-the-art forecast model coherence whether actually rained correspondence
hammond argued concepts coherence correspondence necessary understanding organizing research findings field judgment decision making
likewise i argue they necessary understand conflicts medicine
although concepts provide foundation medical research terms coherence correspondence virtually unknown medical investigators physicians alike
distinction between science making logical sense coherence being empirically correct correspondence seldom appears medical literature
paper examines number medical controversies using framework coherence correspondence hypothesizes failure appreciate differences between coherence correspondence underlying cause controversies
furthermore reframing disagreement terms two different but equally useful approaches may reduce eliminate controversies
several illustrations medical controversies show both tension between approaches well explicit lack awareness concepts
