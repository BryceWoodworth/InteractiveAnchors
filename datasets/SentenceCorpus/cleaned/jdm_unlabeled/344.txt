first experiment was designed contrast prediction probabilistic mental model theory concerning sampling procedure hard-easy effect
experiment failed support theory's prediction particular pair randomly sampled item sets would differ percentage correct but observation german participants performed practically well comparisons between u s cities many they did not even recognize than comparisons between german cities about they knew much more ultimately led formulation recognition heuristic
experiment number was second time successful attempt unconfound item difficulty sampling procedure
experiment number participants' knowledge recognition each city was elicited how often could used make inference was manipulated
choices were consistent recognition heuristic about number percent cases when discriminated people had no additional knowledge about recognized city about number percent when they had knowledge
frequency heuristic could used affected percentage correct mean confidence overconfidence predicted
size reference class was also manipulated modified effects meaningful theoretically important ways
 introduction 
history science technology repeatedly demonstrates many laws discovered many inventions made serendipitously by-product when researchers striving something else
recognition heuristic just one example was formulated post-hoc explanation puzzling finding was observed while attempting test specific prediction theory probabilistic mental models
while other papers contained series special issues many references given therein illustrate how stimulating formulation recognition heuristic was how much research spurred present paper turns back clock reports three studies were conducted late number 's early number 's
paper organized follows first part provides historical context led formulation recognition heuristic
at outset part brief summary pmm theory given
experiment number then reported was conducted address one criticisms theory namely confounding sampling procedure item difficulty
specifically compared over underconfidence two item sets were generated same sampling procedure but were nevertheless supposed differ respect percentage correct
attempt failed yielding counter-intuitive finding german participants performed about same when making comparisons between german cities when making comparisons between u s cities
experiment number reports second time successful attempt unconfound item difficulty sampling procedure order answer question motivated experiment number
second part also historical reports experiment number provides best my knowledge first empirical test recognition heuristic
was designed find out whether results obtained experiment number could explained participants having used recognition heuristic
experiment participants' knowledge recognition each city was elicited how often could used make inference was manipulated
also manipulated inclusion criterion turn size reference class cities were drawn when constructing paired comparisons
