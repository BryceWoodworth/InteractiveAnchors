 introduction 
humans sometimes act order reach outcome other times out enjoyment activity itself
difference been referred extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation incentives vs motivation utilitarian vs hedonically driven behaviour represents general dichotomy between action goal action mean towards goal
there often conflict between hedonic quality behaviour its consequences
although hedonic qualities could seen particular kind behavioural consequence experiential part displeasure definition present whereas other behavioural outputs lie future
thus one suggested underlying mechanism tension between behaviour consequences fundamental difference time perspective associated ongoing activities their consequences
been suggested need self-regulation exists most individuals due inconsistency between short long-term consequences option
intertemporal discounting exemplifies one failure balance subjective value immediate more distant goals systematic devaluation future opposed immediate outcomes
present paper focuses dilemmas where values associated performance behaviour values consequences conflict even when holding time-perspective constant
several theoretical accounts may shed light difference between actions goals means
meta-theories human motivation self-determination theory centre motivational mechanisms claiming set basic motivational needs drive behaviour
need competence autonomy belongingness proposed general behavioural driving forces fairly independently time-perspectives
thus addition motivation towards mastery independence social norms direct our behaviour
most socially accepted action default option complying may not experienced decision making
other theories focus preventing factors cognitive limitations
end several dual-process theories demonstrate our ability unique human predisposition pay attention potentially contradictory sources information e g affective experiential vs reason based consequential
authors circumvent issue time perspective indirectly showing how intuitive basic effortless experiential heuristic system processing faster than intentional reason-based effortful rational analytical system
rapid processing affective immediate information may result behaviour more inclined follow affective rather than analytical system
there ample evidence intentions may directed at activities just pleasure little consideration potential consequences e g smoking heavy drinking unsafe sex hazardous driving unhealthy eating
basis tension between consequences feelings present study set out compare contrast two theoretical psychological frameworks identify key structures processes planned feelings-based behaviour theory planned behaviour risk-as-feelings hypothesis
furthermore aimed at empirical investigation core predictors behavioural intentions decision making under ambivalence
decision ambivalence here defined perceived tension between hedonic quality behaviour its potential consequences behavioural choices
present paper organized following two theoretical frameworks presented first followed theoretical analysis separates their basic components into shared unique variables
then present outline results two empirical studies investigating predictive power models
next discuss findings light theoretical frameworks reviewed literature
