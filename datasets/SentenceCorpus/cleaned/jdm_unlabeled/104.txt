 
participants drank either regular root beer sugar-free diet root beer before working probability-learning task they tried predict two events would occur each number trials
one event e number randomly occurred number trials other e number number
each last two blocks number trials regular group matched prediction event frequencies
contrast diet group predicted e number more often each blocks
after task participants were asked write down rules they used responding
blind ratings rule complexity were inversely related e number predictions final number trials
participants also took longer advance after incorrect predictions before predicting e number reflecting time revising consulting rules
results support hypothesis effortful controlled process normative rule-generation produces matching probability-learning experiments process function glucose availability
 introduction 
two-choice probability learning pl experiments one event e number better chance occurring than other e number event likelihoods independent responses
participant's task predict event will occur each trial
although participants could maximize hits exclusively predicting e number they tend approximately match prediction frequencies outcome probabilities many trials
example if e number occurs number percent trials e number occurs other number percent trials people usually predict e number about number percent their choices hundreds trials
probability-matching pm behavior suboptimal because produces hits only number percent trials number x number number x number instead maximal number percent hit rate always predicting e number
