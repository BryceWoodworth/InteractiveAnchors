identify two major concerns claim first demonstrations typically involve subjective preferences effects distraction cannot objectively assessed beneficial second there no direct evidence dwa manipulation promotes unconscious decision processes
describe two tasks based dwa paradigm found no evidence distraction manipulation led decision processes subjectively unconscious nor reduced influence presentation order upon performance
crucially found lack awareness decision process was associated poorer performance both terms subjective preference measures used traditional dwa paradigm equivalent task where performance objectively assessed
therefore argue reliance conscious memory itself explain data
thus dwa paradigm not adequate method assessing beneficial unconscious thought
 introduction 
decision theorists long distinguished between analytical intuitive decision making often attributing them different processing modes
despite flourishing theoretical literature supporting dichotomous view number empirical attempts contrast effects intuition deliberation limited
one reason lack research difficulty assessing goodness any particular decision
another reason could originate traditional assumption reasoning analysis always lead better outcomes
nevertheless some theories subscribing dichotomous view assume under certain circumstances intuitive decisions bring more optimal results than rational thinking
number empirical studies given support notion suggesting some tasks really better off without conscious thinking
results were often explained hypothesis reasoning lead people use non-optimal criteria consequently make worse decisions intuitive decisions benefit use smart heuristics
dijksterhuis his colleagues however propose alternative explanation superior performance when analytic strategies not used
according unconscious thought theory intuitive decisions may benefit unconscious thought high capacity process weight numerous pieces information integrate them into decisions automatically via distributed bottom-up processing
they argue smart unconscious process more capable complex information-dense decision situations than conscious thought limited working memory capacity
empirical support utt comes primarily deliberation-without-attention dwa paradigm participants presented list positive negative attributes describing variety possible choices within particular category e g apartments
opportunity thinking before choosing manipulated across three conditions participants immediate decision condition make their decision at once those conscious thought condition four minutes think those unconscious thought condition make choice after four minutes performance irrelevant task
according utt best choices will made participants unconscious thought condition because irrelevant task interval provides opportunity unconscious processing information
contrast conscious thought condition assumed promote choices based limited-capacity conscious processing
been noted previously also possible forced delay between evaluation may completed early four minute interval response conscious thought condition may somehow e g self-generated interference reduce performance immediate decision condition acts baseline providing control counterintuitive effect forced delay
initial studies using paradigm provided many illustrations dwa effect supporting utt
however several recent papers challenged interpretation questioned degree support original paradigm offers utt
series studies reported failure replicate original results
others found effect may only occur under specific circumstances
acker used meta-analysis determine benefit choices following unconscious thought first number studies published was modest mean effect size g number
more recent meta-analysis number studies strick et al n d reported similar effect size g number authors propose evidence important moderators effect different designs task
