sample number economists completed self-report survey examining decision process different decision contexts life including pension decisions
overall participants showed low motivation engage process choosing private pension plan compared their motivation engage other decision tasks
however economists invested more decision process showed greater satisfaction their decision regarding their pension plan when they had more positive perception pensions
perception represented higher subjective likelihood receiving pension allowances long period profitable view balance between current payments expected incomes pension saving
 introduction 
studies demonstrated people show low motivation engage process choosing pension plan expressed their minor involvement process
result they tend settle default choice show passivity procrastination decision-making sometimes avoid making decision
lusardi found most people given very little thought retirement even when they just few years away leaving workforce
benartzi thaler reviewed empirical works lay people's heuristics biases their savings retirement decisions
they show lay people slow join advantageous plans make infrequent changes adopt naive diversification strategies when establishing their portfolio
addition they rely non-experts' advice spouses friends tend influenced framing manipulations
nowadays people living longer than ever retirement becoming more more expensive cost living especially medical care prescription drugs continues increase
planners more likely experience satisfying retirement because they greater financial resources rely after they stop working
therefore important understand lack motivation engage process choosing pension plan well find ways increase involvement motivation
one reasons lay people's low involvement might most people simply do not knowledge capacity interpret information presented them employers governments regarding private pension plans
they do not know how appropriately evaluate balance choices make decision based weighing alternatives
when given default option knowing pension plan most people choose suggested employees' committee lay people may use make quick decision put issue aside even when pension plan may not best them personally
when people confronted large number options more options they given less likely they engaged choice task especially when alternatives seen relatively similar they not able understand variations among them
lack relevant knowledge understanding may major reason peoples' low involvement pension decision processes
other hand if lack knowledge main reason people's low interest would expect experts well-educated economists who do knowledge resources understanding behave differently showing real efforts make best decision regarding their future incomes
spite above assumption behavioral decision research suggests even required knowledge people might not act according rational models systematically examining different options their relevant attributes
experts like lay people also prone simplifying heuristics biases
moreover when choice task complex includes many objects when objects relatively similar some their attributes tendency use intuitive simplifying strategies increases
besides simplifying heuristics emotional reactions towards task might also affect decisions both experts lay people
specifically perception feelings towards pension concept may affect decision maker's attitude toward task
affect information hypothesis suggests judgments affected positive negative feelings towards decision target other people places objects well words memories etc

positive negative emotions toward decision task might directly affect decision process
negative emotions towards pension retirement might result unpleasant thoughts negative images future raised at time pension decisions financial dependence ill health death aging disabilities
thoughts may psychologically threatening anxiety provoking causing retirement anxiety may not restricted older adults
interestingly hayslip et al found younger adults showed even greater anxiety about retirement than older adults
indeed results neukam hershey suggest lay people who experience retirement anxiety less likely plan save future
addition since people see their pension expenses their pay slips every month incomes expected only distant future they might perceive their contributions greater than discounted future income streams
benartzi thaler suggest people may experience myopic loss aversion their saving retirement decisions being hypersensitive short-term losses
negative perceptions may decrease people's motivation invest decision increasing heuristics biases decision process
some people may believe they would not enjoy their pension many years therefore might perceive pension expense only little gain
optimistic people same objective life expectancy who believe they will receive their pension payments longer period time expected more positive attitude towards their pension
their thoughts about their future well their pension fund evaluation expected more positive living longer means receiving more money pension plans
positive views held more optimistic people may enhance motivation engage decision process may produce better satisfaction chosen pension plan
summary positive negative perceptions pension concept likely guide emotional reactions toward decision task at time decision therefore expected influence motivation invest decision process
low motivation invest decision process may lead insufficient search information set default option other shortcuts may lead decision departs decision maker's best interest
suggest two main factors may shape subjective perceptions pensions first optimistic pessimistic subjective views likelihood receive pension payments at least number years
pension decisions may fundamentally different people who believe saving today will allow them secure their standard living future opposed people pessimistic perceptions same expected longevity
people who perceive likelihood enjoying their pension many years higher expected care more about not having adequate financial means their old age since possibility experience need more concrete real them
therefore optimistic people more likely make efforts show greater motivation invest their pension decision
note use terms optimism pessimism all through paper refers subjective evaluation likelihood receive pension payments at least number years rather than general personality trait
second perceptions balance between gains losses pension payments balance might represent positive perception pensions when people believe future discounted benefits would greater than current discounted future contributions negative perception if reverse
hypothesize motivation invest pension decisions would greater people who positive view pensions retirement caused one both above factors
people expected more involved decision process examining larger number alternatives before choosing pension plan searching more information about chosen plan
