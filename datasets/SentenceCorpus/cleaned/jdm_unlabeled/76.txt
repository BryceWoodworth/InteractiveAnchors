 
individuals often ambiguity-averse when choosing among purely chance-based prospects
however they often prefer apparently ambiguous ability-based prospects unambiguous chance-based prospects
according competence hypothesis pattern derives favorable perceptions one's competence
most past tests competence hypothesis ambiguity confounded personal controllability source ambiguity e g chance vs missing information
unconfound factors three experiments find strong evidence independent effects both ambiguity aversion competence
experiment number participants preferred unambiguous chance-based option ambiguous ability-based option when ambiguity derived chance rather than uncertainty about one's own ability
experiments number number used different operationalizations ambiguity choice contexts actual consequences participants attempted avoid both ambiguity chance insofar they could
findings support extend competence hypothesis demonstrating ambiguity aversion independent personal controllability source ambiguity
 introduction 
folk wisdom advises better devil you know than devil you don't
most people abide logic when choosing between options known probabilities others ambiguous probabilities second-order uncertainty
people often choose former  manifesting what decision scientists call ambiguity aversion
classic demonstration ellsberg decision makers faced choice between two urns one contained number percent red number percent black marbles whereas other had unknown distribution
selection marble specified color produced monetary prize
participants showed no color preference but they did show clear preference number number urn
preference hard justify rational grounds because ambiguous urn cannot contain lower proportion both red black marbles
later work showed people prefer unambiguous urn even when expected value other ambiguous urn higher they willing pay more ambiguity premium draw number number urn
several persuasive explanations been offered account ambiguity aversion
frisch baron proposed decision makers particularly averse missing information especially if information known manipulated others opponent may become available at some later point decision process
authors also suggest people concerned about blame regret may follow decision made context missing information
example parents relatively less willing vaccinate their children setting where characteristics children who experience side effects vaccination unspecified
similarly heath tversky argue participants ellsberg paradigm mentally simulate attributions will made following selection marble consequently worry about being blamed if ambiguous urn turns out present smaller chance winning
indeed curley yates abrams observed ambiguity aversion greater when contents ambiguous urn will revealed others
important feature ellsberg paradigm contents ambiguous urn knowable  just unknown participants
outcome decision also hinges chance not any way tethered participants' own knowledge abilities
heath tversky suggest if people feel competent decision domain  if competence related outcome  they should exhibit less ambiguity aversion
illustrative study participants predicted outcomes american football games over five-week period also assessed their own knowledge about each game
they then chose between betting team they predicted would win lottery chances winning were identical but determined chance
long participants perceived probability winning number higher those higher perceived knowledge chose bet over lottery suggesting perceptions competence domain attenuated ambiguity aversion
similar findings emerged contexts where voters made predictions about outcomes november number presidential election where students made predictions about future news events
competence decision domain likely reduced perception missing information frisch baron posited key ambiguity aversion
thus heath tversky proposed perceived competence affects perceived ambiguity does not independent effect its own
however other characteristics decision paradigm suggest competence independent effect
most importantly people generally prefer controllable uncontrollable outcomes more optimistic about outcomes controllable outcomes
most though not all tests competence hypothesis unambiguous option chance-determined meaning manipulation competence may confounded outcome controllability
if probabilities skill-based option were ambiguous participants might still choose skill option suggesting they prefer skill over chance enough override any opposing effect ambiguity
controllability rather than ambiguity may also account choice betting familiar vs unfamiliar domains competence e g weather one's own geographical area vs weather distal unknown geographical area given familiarity proximity conflated controllability due magical thinking
another possibility current context people responding not competence controllability per se but rather reason ambiguity
ambiguity could different effects depending its source
tests competence hypothesis ability-based option ambiguous because not associated clearly stated probability winning there chance option
ambiguity instead related natural variation competence perceptions competence thereby confounding source ambiguity competence
if ambiguity associated ability-based option derived factors unrelated personal competence chance likely ability-based option would become less appealing
above suggested chance-based options tests competence hypothesis should possess ambiguity i e range probabilities rather than point estimate here take one step further arguing competence-based options should possess same kind ambiguity untethered competence
finally previous experiments offered competence options were based priori beliefs limiting way competence was conceptualized
no cases was competence manipulated  particular giving participants feedback competence domain  more directly test role competence choices involving ambiguity
report three experiments systematically separate ambiguity controllability source ambiguity order determine whether people continue exhibit ambiguity aversion predicted competence hypothesis
experiment number participants face choice between unambiguous chance-based prospect ambiguous ability-based prospect
importantly latter prospect ambiguous because its difficulty determined chance
predicted decision-makers would prefer chance-based option  contrary typical pattern tests competence hypothesis but nevertheless illustrative ambiguity aversion
experiment number builds study presenting participants chance option low-ambiguity ability-based option approximately number percent chance winning high-ambiguity ability-based option win probabilities ranging number percent  number percent
because ambiguity inherent third option due chance because first option entirely chance-based expect participants prefer low-ambiguity ability-based option over other two  demonstrating preferences controllability against ambiguity same context
experiment also give participants performance feedback upon base their choices rather than relying priori beliefs about competence
experiment number builds standard competence hypothesis paradigm pitting two ability-based options against each other while independently manipulating level ambiguity
finally ask participants make same choice someone else thereby completely separating ambiguity controllability
if ambiguity aversion independent controllability then choices other people should mirror those self
experiment number tests similar hypothesis using different operationalization ambiguity again unaffected personal controllability
case give participants choice among unambiguous chance-based option ability-based option where they must outperform low ambiguity opponent ability-based option where they must instead outperform high ambiguity opponent
experiment number expect people prefer ability-based options but show ambiguity aversion selecting option they compete against low ambiguity opponent
additional characteristic previous studies literature probability winning chance-based option was always unambiguous i e fixed probability
experiments number number also introduce ambiguity chance-based option form range probabilities
doing so provides even more conservative test whether preference ability-based tasks previous tests was due ambiguity simply preference ability-based over chance-based tasks
moreover defining ambiguity terms opponent experiment number yet again disentangled ambiguity personal competence different manner than experiment number where ask participants make choices both themselves others
sum report three experiments designed test extend competence hypothesis
studies include both hypothetical actual choices final two experiments more than one ability-based choice
expect people will exhibit ambiguity aversion even when controllability held constant
they should prefer chance-based options only when ability options more ambiguous but when choosing among similar ability-based options they should prefer those lower ambiguity
