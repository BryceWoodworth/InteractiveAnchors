 
binary sequences characterized various features
two characteristics-alternation rate run length-have repeatedly been shown influence judgments randomness
two characteristics however usually been investigated separately without controlling other feature
because two features correlated but not identical seems critical analyze their unique impact well their interaction so understand more clearly what influences judgments randomness
end two experiments perception binary sequences orthogonally manipulated alternation rate maximum run length i e length longest run within sequence
results show alternation rate consistently exerts unique effect judgments randomness but effect alternation rate contingent length longest run within sequence
effect maximum run length was found small less consistent
together findings extend prior randomness research integrating literature realms perception categorization prediction well showing unique joint effects alternation rate maximum run length judgments randomness
 introduction 
everyday life individuals often encounter binary sequences outcomes tossing coins gains losses gambles black red outcomes roulette wheels birth orders families ups downs stock market
whether sequences perceived either random lawful patterned important implications both level cognitive processes e g categorizations inferences level behavioral manifestations e g following up streak
understanding how individuals form judgments randomness therefore critical
present manuscript contributes goal investigating effects two critical features binary sequences-the length longest run alternation rate-on judgments randomness
imagine coin being tossed five times
first coin comes up heads
then heads again
same true third fourth fifth toss resulting sequence five heads hhhhh
most individuals who perceive sequence would judge non-random because they evaluate randomness not based generating mechanism-a coin toss-but resulting sequence outcomes hhhhh hthth
understand how judgments randomness formed therefore important analyze features outcome sequences
two characteristics binary sequences outcomes alternation rate run length repeatedly been identified determining judgments randomness
usually however two characteristics been investigated separate lines research without controlling other
specifically research perception categorization randomness primarily focused alternation rate while neglecting run length
contrast research prediction randomness primarily focused run length while neglecting alternation rate
because two features correlated but not identical argue critical isolate separate effects two characteristics so understand more clearly what influences judgments randomness
here offer evidence two characteristics may not only unique effects but effect one may contingent other
particular argue effect alternation rate contingent run length
