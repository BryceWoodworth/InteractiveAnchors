 
five experiments addressed controversy probability judgment literature centers efficacy framing probabilities frequencies
natural frequency view predicts frequency formats attenuate errors while nested-sets view predicts highlighting set-subset structure problem reduces error regardless problem format
study tested predictions using conjunction task
previous studies reporting frequency formats reduced conjunction errors confounded reference class problem format
after controlling confound present study's findings show conjunction errors reduced using either probability frequency format frequency effects depend upon presence reference class frequency formats do not promote better statistical reasoning than probability formats
 introduction 
evidence suggests information presented frequency formats rather than probability formats attenuates many cognitive biases found probabilistic reasoning
there evidence frequency advantage bayesian reasoning overcoming overconfidence bias reducing conjunction errors extensional reasoning
although specific explanations frequency effect vary task general conclusion reached proponents natural frequency perspective presenting frequencies promotes intuitive statistical reasoning because formats compatible evolutionary-based computational algorithm
alternative explanations well contradictory evidence frequency effect been offered
particular nested-sets hypothesis suggests frequency effects may indirect consequence inducing set-inclusion problem representation contributes making problem's logical structure transparent thus easily solvable
according nested-sets hypothesis presenting information way allows people extract subsets relative supersets problem structure key facilitating reasoning
facilitation occur whether not information presented frequencies probabilities so long critical set-subset structure made salient
example sloman et al tested three versions medical diagnosis problem first posed casscells schoenberger grayboys
probability version problem was stated follows frequency version problem adapted cosmides tooby was stated follows third problem version was nest-sets probability version highlighted set-subset structure problem
was stated follows note all three problem versions specific reference class i e number americans provided
what different between problem versions however both frequency version nest-sets probability version highlight set-subset structure among critical categories those who test positive whether not they disease number number those who test positive disease number number
natural frequency hypothesis predicts only frequency problem version will facilitate bayesian reasoning result approximately correct solution number number number percent
nested-sets hypothesis predicts both frequency version nested-sets probability version will facilitate correct responding because both versions make set-subset relationships among critical categories transparent
sloman et al 's findings support nested-sets hypothesis
they found probability version resulted significantly fewer correct answers than did either frequency version nested-sets probability version
latter two problem versions did not significantly differ number correct solutions they elicited
evans et al ran similar study but included frequency hard condition false positive rate number percent was stated number number instead number number thus obscuring problem's nested-sets structure
further support nested-sets hypothesis evans et al found both probability frequency hard problem versions resulted significantly fewer correct responses than did frequency version highlighted set-subset structure stating false positive rate number number
results also consistent findings reported macchi mellers mcgraw who offered similar interpretations
perhaps strongest evidence favor nested-sets hypothesis provided yamagishi who presented bayesian reasoning problem frequency probability formats crossed presence absence diagrammatical representation problem structure roulette wheel whose areas reflect relative proportion hits misses false positives
he found absence diagram there was frequency effect
presence diagram however there was no significant difference proportion correct responses between frequency probability problem formats
evidence suggests bayesian reasoning facilitated proper problem representation frequency formats offer no additional advantage when problem structure task clarified
aside bayesian reasoning almost no research examining nested-sets hypothesis been conducted other judgment biases frequency effects also been reported
theoretically meaningful extend growing evidence favoring nested-sets hypothesis tasks reveal failures extensional reasoning conjunction fallacy
date only two published accounts examined frequency effects classic linda problem only one study provided direct test nested-sets hypothesis problem
both fiedler hertwig gigerenzer reported frequency formats led fewer proportions participants committing conjunction errors comparison probability formats
there was potential confound those studies however
reference class was given frequency version problem was absent probability version
unclear those studies whether reduction conjunction errors direct result manipulating problem format result presenting information manner facilitates problem representation
illustrate consider two versions linda problem presented fiedler
both versions presented following information probability format participants were asked rank order list number statements about linda according their probability
among statements were two constituent categories linda bank teller linda active feminist movement their conjunction linda bank teller active feminist movement
frequency format participants were given same information statements judge but were asked how many number women who like linda do following statements apply
note frequency format asks numeric frequency estimate provides specific reference class out make estimate
probability format asks ranks does not provide reference class judgment
similar confound existed studies reported hertwig gigerenzer
confound between response mode numeric estimate vs rank reference class present vs absent prohibits clear interpretation findings
indeed hertwig chase reported significantly more conjunction errors committed ranking probability response mode than numeric probability estimation response mode
frequency effect found both fiedler hertwig gigerenzer studies could result confounding response mode problem format
facilitating effect frequency format could also secondary consequence providing participants reference class focusing their attention sub-categories within class rather than direct result framing problem frequency judgment
sloman et al reported finding no significant differences between frequency probability formats linda problem when set-inclusion relationships between critical categories were made opaque separating constituent categories their conjunction seven filler statements
their finding suggests when set-subset structure problem obscured frequency effect disappears
finding consistent nested-sets hypothesis
purpose present study examine whether frequency effects remain after controlling reference class confound noted earlier research conjunction errors
