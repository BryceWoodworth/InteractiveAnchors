 
sacred protected values important influences decision making particularly context intergroup disputes
thus far know little about process value becoming sacred why one person may more likely than another hold sacred value
present evidence participation religious ritual perceived threat group lead people more likely consider preferences protected sacred values
specifically three studies carried out americans palestinians show more people participate religious ritual more likely they report preference sacred value studies number  number b people claim more sacred values when they reminded religious ritual study number c effect religious ritual likelihood holding sacred value amplified perception high threat in-group study number
discuss implications findings understanding intergroup conflicts suggest avenues future research into emergence spread sacred values
 introduction 
intergroup conflicts become particularly difficult solve when communities transform preferences rights water sources land into protected sacred values
neuroimaging studies behavioral research suggest people process sacred values terms associated deontological rules rather than their utilitarian value
specifically when people transform preferences into sacred values they appear use rules govern reasoning about religious values regarding taboo any attempt treat sacred values fungible secular goods
ironically more money material things one offers encourage people make concessions over their sacred values more resistant people seem compromise
thus standard negotiation techniques offering people added material incentives threatening disincentives encourage compromise backfire when sacred values involved
given influence sacred values decision making seems important understand how values acquire sacredness explain why some people more likely than others think their preferences sacred values
while many sacred values deep historical roots others aquire sacredness quite quickly
famously ghandi tranformed salt into sacred value part his opposition british colonial rule
paper report first steps research program investigating process
our research was guided two ideas first people may confer sacredness preferences objects practices incorporating preferences into religious rituals thus expanding category religious values include previously secular preferences second process more likely occur under conditions high perceived group threat
