 
propose people weight fluent easy process information more heavily than disfluent information when making judgments
cue fluency was manipulated independent objective cue validity three studies findings support our hypothesis
experiment number participants weighted consumer review more heavily when was written clear font than less clear font
experiment number participants placed more weight information when was focus than when was blurry
experiment number participants placed more weight financial information brokerage firms easy pronounce names than those hard pronounce names
studies demonstrate fluency affects cue weighting independent objective cue validity
 introduction 
when making judgments decisions people numerous pieces information i e cues available aid decision process
when deciding whether patient diabetes doctor might examine patient's symptoms family health history lab results
stockbroker might consider companies' profit margins quarterly projections recent activity
judge jurist might consider testimony several witnesses various other pieces evidence
so much information available how do decide cues weight most heavily
conventional models suggest decision-makers should weight information based objective cue validity
according normative principles weighted additive additive difference weighted averaging models people should consider all available cues might inform particular judgment
they should then differentially weight each cue based upon how successfully cue predicts outcome
however approach cannot perfectly explain how naive decision-makers who unaware cue validities might make judgments decisions
nor explain how people's judgments often result overweighting less valid information
given learning cue validities time consuming inaccurate propose people might use cue's fluency ease processed additional basis weighting cues
fluency-based account cue weighting does not require decision-makers know objective cue validities
instead explanation highlights rather simple tendency placing more weight information feels easy process
