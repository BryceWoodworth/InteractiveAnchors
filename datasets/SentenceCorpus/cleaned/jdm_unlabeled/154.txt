show items maximization inventory much better psychometric properties when compared original maximization scale
satisficing scale new addition study maximization behavior demonstrate scale positively correlated positive adaptation whereas decision difficulty alternative search scales positively correlated nonproductive decisional behavior
maximization inventory was then compared previous maximization scales while decision difficulty alternative search scales positively correlated similar previous constructs satisficing scale offers dimension entirely different maximization
 introduction 
one most interesting variables decision making research tendency toward maximizing versus satisficing
based originally simon's theory bounded rationality schwartz suggested there may individual differences degree individual maximizer who attempts find absolute best solution versus satisficer who comfortable satisfactory good enough solution
schwartz argued not only could tendencies influence outcomes decision but also maximizing could reduce psychological well-being
example maximizers may worry unforeseen option will turn out best one consequence they will try collect much information possible when making even simplest decisions
examine relationship between maximizing tendencies well-being mental health measures maximization behavior were developed
first most widely used measure was number item maximization scale developed schwartz et al
nenkov morrin ward schwartz hulland subsequently examined factor structure maximization scale found three factors they labeled alternative search decision difficulty high standards
alternative search category consisted six items measuring tendency expend resources exploring all possible opportunities e g when i watch tv i channel surf often scanning through available options even while attempting watch one program

decision difficulty category consisted four items representing degree difficulty experienced when making choices among abundant options e g i often find difficult shop gift friend

high standards category consisted three items reflecting decision makers' tendency hold high standards themselves things general e g no matter what i do i highest standards myself

contrast diab gillespie highhouse argued multidimensional nature maximization scale contradictory definition maximization tendency
defining maximization tendency general tendency pursue identification optimal alternative diab et al developed maximization tendency scale
maximization tendency scale was constructed using three high standards items maximization scale adding six new items mainly focusing goal maximizers optimize outcomes decisions
all scale development satisficing-the theoretical opposite maximizing-has never been directly measured only rarely mentioned literature
research scales schwartz's hypothesis concerning relationships well-being received differential support depending whether total scores subscales were used
schwartz et al reported results several studies all supported hypothesized adverse relationships maximization psychological well-being
their study number maximization was negatively correlated happiness optimism self esteem life satisfaction positively correlated depression regret perfectionism
four additional studies showed maximization scale total scores were positively correlated depression negatively correlated subjective happiness
schwartz et al explained maximizers tend engage extensive alternative search increase possibility finding best option but extensive search process may induce more anticipated regret decrease pleasure once choice been made
related studies nenkov et al used number item measures each three factors
they found scores high standards category were positively correlated optimism negatively correlated depression uncorrelated subjective happiness
decision difficulty showed opposite pattern being negatively correlated subjective happiness optimism positively correlated depression
lai concluded decision difficulty category key factor leading negative correlations well-being outcomes supports findings nenkov et al
contrast diab et al found evidence suggesting high standards category was responsible relationship because smaller correlations were found when maladaptive personality traits were compared maximization tendency scale rather than maximization scale
thus previous studies suggested maximization measures consist several components relationships well-being indices were heavily influenced method measurement
clarify nature maximization construct degree its elements were related measures psychological well-being maximization scale maximization tendency scale were examined four studies conducted rim turner betz nygren
rim et al concluded maximization scale measures three separate factors postulated its authors but only alternative search decisional difficulty factors both positively correlated each other negatively correlated indices well-being
high standards correlated strongly maximization tendency scale consisting mainly high standards items was strongly correlated positive indices well-being e g optimism happiness functioning e g self-esteem self-efficacy
high standards subscale maximization tendency scale were positively correlated analytical decision making style while alternative search decision difficulty subscales were positively correlated regret-based decision making style procrastination
item-response theory analysis rim et al indicated serious weaknesses psychometric properties items existing scales
addition their experimental study confirmed alternative search decision difficulty were positively correlated maximization behavior while high standards maximization tendency scale were not
findings serious implications measurement maximization behavior
first although high standards useful construct does not seem fit concept maximization postulated schwartz colleagues
conceptually alternative search dimension seems closest construct maximizing originally postulated schwartz
however similarity pattern correlations between decision difficulty scale alternative search scale criterion variables suggests similar consequences if not similar meanings
thus propose items focusing behavioral aspects e g alternative search emotional features e g perceived decisional difficulty should included nomological network but items not closely aligned aspects should discarded e g high standards
all previous classical test theory analyses item-response theory analyses conducted rim et al suggest poor psychometric properties
former analyses most subscale alphas were below number number minimum usually considered acceptable research
although may attributed length scales item-response theory analyses suggest items themselves not very discriminating
also content some items may undermine content validity scale
example maximization scale describes some maximization behaviors specific situations may not universal all respondents e g renting videos really difficult
i'm always struggling pick best ones

items too specific might confound degree maximization inexperience participant event
new items reflect more general maximization tendencies e g buying car more specific than buying groceries may prove useful
finally all alternative search decision difficulty items maximization scale stated same direction i e more searching greater perceived decision difficulty respectively means satisficing measured only indirectly presumed lower end maximization dimension
direct examination satisficing construct would contribute understanding maximization behavior
based previous research nature measurement correlates maximization behavior present series studies was designed develop evaluate new measures decision difficulty alternative search dimensions
addition develop measure satisficing examine its relationships other maximizing dimensions indices well-being decision making styles
study number use classical test theory factor analyses item-response theory determine best items each three scales larger item pool
our goal was develop separate scales number  number items each collectively separate scales form maximization inventory intended measure maximization construct holistically
after selecting best items each scale report values coefficient alpha each scale resulting factor structure estimated parameter values item-response theory analysis
study number was designed investigate relationship between newly developed inventory measures well-being
content new scales validated through their relationship criterion measures demonstrated rim et al
study number examined relationships new scales two major maximization scales studied date-the maximization scale maximization tendency scale
