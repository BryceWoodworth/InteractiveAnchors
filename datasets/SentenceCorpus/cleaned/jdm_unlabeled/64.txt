efforts potentially undermined however variations wording used different researchers
current study sought determine whether when how variations wording influence moral judgments
online participants responded number different moral vignettes e g trolley problem using number number adjectives wrong inappropriate forbidden blameworthy
half sample adjectives were preceded adverb morally
results indicated people were more apt judge act wrong inappropriate than forbidden blameworthy disgusting acts were rated more acceptable when morally was included
although some wording differences emerged effects sizes were small suggest studies moral judgment different wordings legitimately compared
 introduction 
more more psychological neuroscientific research moral judgments appears each year
fascinating results accumulate question arises whether how individual studies fit together form larger picture
order connect various studies guide future work field researchers need determine studies conflict support each other simply talking past each other
unfortunately precise comparisons hampered use different moral terms across studies
different researchers ask whether acts wrong forbidden versus permitted inappropriate deserve blame
some researchers include adverb morally before terms whereas others do not
unclear whether judgments what morally wrong vary response same factors do judgments what forbidden inappropriate blameworthy
some evidence comes meta-analysis asymmetry between forbid versus allow attitudes research
study demonstrated people reluctant forbid but will readily not allow even though judgments conceptually equivalent
asymmetry suggests moral judgments well may influenced subtle variations wording
further evidence cushman showed harmless acts were judged more wrong than blameworthy only when act was intended believed cause harm
finding also suggests people some circumstances will draw fine distinctions between moral terms
until effects wording variations understood cannot tell whether studies similar moral issues couched different terms really agree disagree
addition some wording effects moral judgments would undermine search moral faculty
some researchers suggest moral judgments result innate psychological mechanisms even moral module conforms universal moral grammar
others propose dual-process models build emotions beliefs desires consequences into processes form moral judgments
theories many more would challenged if people judge acts very different ways based moral terms used because psychologically real mechanisms would unlikely vary markedly fine differences wording within particular natural language
conversely if certain patterns moral judgments robust enough persist through non-substantial variations wording would help defend assumption studies investigating distinctive psychological mechanisms
order bring research together into coherent field determine whether there distinctive psychological mechanisms studied moral psychology need know whether when how much phrasing questions different terms may lead different moral judgments
