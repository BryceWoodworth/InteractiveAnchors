 
investors like any decision maker feel regret when they compare outcome investment what outcome would been had they invested differently
argue show counterfactual comparison process most likely take place when decision maker's expectations violated
across five scenario experiments found decision makers were influenced only forgone investment outcomes when realized investment fell short expected result
however when their investments exceeded prior expectations effect foregone investment regret disappeared
addition experiment number found individual differences need maximize further moderated effects their expectations maximizers always take into account forgone investment
final experiment found when probed make counterfactual comparisons also investments exceed expectations may lead regret
together experiments reveal insights into comparative processes leading decision regret
 introduction 
regret negative emotion most us familiar
highly relevant emotion context decision making been widely studied psychologists economists consumer behavior researchers
regret unpleasant feeling associated wish undo regretted event strong tendency metaphorically kick oneself wanting get second chance
makes regret uniquely linked decisions made been shown powerful predictor behavior
zeelenberg pieters summarized scattered findings theories concerning regret its impact decision making proposed integrative theory regret regulation
their proposition number p number they state regret comparison-based emotion self-blame experienced when people realize imagine their present situation would been better had they decided differently past
investor who thinks example if only i had bought google stock i would earned much more feels regret
theory regret regulation was developed understand how consumers deal regret proposes strategies used regulate
fully understand impact regret important further develop insights into psychology emotion processes may moderate
discuss here how prior expectations about outcomes decisions play moderating role
let us start fact regret counterfactual emotion
feel regret one needs run mental simulation what happened what could happened instead then compare two
hence forgone outcome becomes reference point against regret computed
how regret been conceptualized early economic regret theories also been well established empirically
comparing decision outcomes regret rejoicing may itself consequential comparative mind-set may actually carry-over subsequent decisions
interestingly lin huang zeelenberg found experience regret also affected other standards comparison
research revealed not only counterfactual comparisons feed into regret but also comparisons obtained outcome prior held expectations
through online survey they interviewed number stock investors security company
investors answered several questions concerning their chosen forgone investments
results showed forgone outcomes considered but non-chosen investments indeed influenced intensity regret felt over their investment
but relevant here a-priori expectations concerning chosen investment were also significantly related regret investors felt over their financial decisions
larger difference between return investment expectations more intense regret
huang tseng found similar effects experimental field study number managers
comparisons obtained outcomes prior held expectancies been linked literature emotional response disappointment but not yet regret
interesting because regret disappointment many ways related though clearly distinct emotions both serve role decision making
ample research also reviewed zeelenberg pieters their proposition number p number reads regret distinct related other specific emotions anger disappointment envy guilt sadness shame general negative affect basis its appraisals experiential content behavioral consequences
may well case regret resembles disappointment sense experience sensitive expectancy violations
whether both emotions respond similarly comparisons expectations forgone alternatives will examined experiment number
two studies best our knowledge first highlight fact expectations may impact feelings regret but note research remains mute respect underlying psychological processes
also data collected studies were primarily correlational precluding strong causal conclusions
present study thus take stock apparent discrepancy between findings huang tseng lin et al prior work regret
do investigate experimentally impact expected outcomes violations expectancies investor regret disappointment hope shed some light psychological processes involved
