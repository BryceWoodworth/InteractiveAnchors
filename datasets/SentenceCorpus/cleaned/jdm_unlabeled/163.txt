 
studying group decision-making challenging multiple reasons
important logistic difficulty studying sufficiently large number groups each multiple participants
assembling groups online could make process easier also provide access group members more representative real-world work groups than sample college students typically comprise lab face-to-face ftf groups
main goal paper compare decisions online groups those ftf groups
did so study manipulated gain loss framing risky decision between groups examined decisions both individual group members groups
all dependent measures compared online ftf sample
our results suggest web-conferencing substitute ftf interaction group decision-making research found no moderation effects communication medium individual group decision outcome variables
effects medium were found suggest use online groups may preferred method group research
wit discussions among online groups were shorter but generated greater number thought units i e they made more efficient use time
 introduction 
studying group decision making more challenging than studying individual decision making multiple reasons
requires more complex data analysis methods due increase number levels analysis relevant variables
also requires increased sample sizes sufficient statistical power test hypotheses groups rather than individuals unit analysis
groups consist members themselves constitute sources variance further complicated variation social interactions group members between groups
all increases between-group variability increases required sample size detect effects experimental manipulations
another challenge practical requirement needing group members present at same time location where single no-shows lead cancelled experimental sessions
