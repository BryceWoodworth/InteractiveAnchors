 
some studies found choices become more risk averse after gains more risk seeking after losses although other studies found opposite
latter tend use hypothetical cases encourage deliberation
current study examined effects prior gains losses task designed encourage less reflective decision making iowa gambling task igt
fifty participants conducted manipulated decision-making task one group gained money whereas other group lost money followed igt
participants who experienced prior monetary loss displayed more risky choice behavior igt than subjects who experienced prior gain
effects were not mediated positive negative affect although sample size may been too small detect small effect
 introduction 
kahneman tversky noted people often risk averse gains risk seeking losses
whether people consider consequence their choice loss gain dependent their point reference
reference point often equivalent current wealth position plays key role theory choice
should possible manipulate perceptions domain gain loss actual prior gains losses
people may see their starting point before gain loss reference point
if they had lost money example they may see new gambles domain losses they therefore might risk seeking
earlier studies effect gains losses show conflicting results
thaler johnson found opposite resultswhich they called house money effect although their participants would take risks gain back all their loss
weber zuchel review literature find some conditions support prospect theory prediction
aside their result however most results consistent prospect theory studies use more realistic situations investment rather than hypothetical tasks
some traditional economic studies addressing theories decision-making assume decision-making based deliberate evaluations varying option-outcome scenarios people weigh pros cons various choices against each other base their decision outcome comparison
kinds choices characterized deliberate carefully thought-out
however some recent psychological studies addressing decision-making show decisions also driven less carefully thought-out choices often implicit automatic based gut-feelings emotions
recently sanfey et al made clear distinction between two psychological systems involved economic decision-making emotional system involves activation automatic processes deliberative system involving controlled processes each having separate neural substrates
present contribution want apply recent knowledge risk aversion
risk aversion after gains consequence people's deliberate conscious decisions avoid risk
case risk aversion largely automatic whereby people's current reference point leads them pursue less risky options without deliberately weighting all outcome scenarios
present study examined role reference point task designed encourage automatic emotional driven decision-making iowa gambling task igt
during igt participants select cards four decks range probability magnitude rewards punishments
translate our hypothesis pertaining risk aversion igt necessary explain igt some detail
igt participants repeatedly choose usually up number times between four decks cards
two decks e g b disadvantageous
they produce large immediate gains but gains followed large losses leading overall loss long run
other remaining decks e g c d advantageous
gains modest but consistent losses small
consistently choosing decks leads gains long run
means people who risk seeking would predominantly choose decks b leading losses long run
conversely people who risk averse will predominantly choose decks c d leading overall gain
means risk aversion translates into better performance overall gains igt whereas risk seeking would translate into poor performance overall losses
psychological process determines people's behavior igt crucial our hypothesis risk aversion not only based deliberately weighting all outcome scenarios
general consensus people performing igt at some point steer towards certain profitable decks rather automatic way
whether automatic behavior entirely unconscious still subject debate see maia mcclelland dunn et al
behavior igt seen form implicit learning whereby behavior changes before people verbalize why they do what they doing
therefore igt regarded instrument capable assessing intuitive emotion-based decision-making processes
addition our central aimto test relative automaticity risk aversionwe another goal
economic studies addressing theories decision-making often rely hypothetical situations choices participants confronted monetary gambles without any real consequences
although use real incentives often not crucial outcome experiments using real incentives important role play establishing quality credibility generalizability experimental data
present study addressed point using real monetary remunerations order mimic real-life decision-making more closely
purpose present study experimentally manipulated reference point
participants first performed manipulated gamble-task they either gained lost money result their performance actuality they had no influence gains losses
note experimental set-up comes close real-life situations person's reference point real perceived often result their prior choices
known individual differences influence behavioral decision-making
individual difference variables include reward sensitivity gender age
line previous research expected our experimental manipulation would effect participants' affect
more precisely prior gain would yield increase positive affect whereas earlier loss would result increase negative affect
been suggested affect might influence decision-making
positive affect promote increased sensitivity losses
present study investigated whether above-mentioned individual differences affect may additional effect participants' decision-making
main hypothesis was people who experienced prior gain gambling task performed better i e made more advantageous choices consequence risk aversion igt compared persons who experienced prior loss
furthermore asked whether effect was influenced subjective affect various other individual differences
