 
recent study indicates acute stress affects moral decision making youssef et al press
current study examines whether results replicated using different kind stressor different kind stress measurement
induced stress number participants cover-story anticipated speech
another group number participants was tested control condition
stress levels stress responses were assessed questionnaires heart rate
all participants performed moral decision-making task describing moral dilemmas
dilemmas were either personal impersonal each offered utilitarian non-utilitarian option
acutely stressed participants compared control participants made fewer utilitarian judgments needed longer making decision
individual physiological stress response was related fewer utilitarian judgments
results line those previously found although different instruments were used
 introduction 
recent research postulates moral decision making influenced automatic emotional responses controlled cognitive processes
there also growing evidence stress affects decision making neuropsychological tasks moral decision making
given moral dilemmas experienced outside laboratory elicit stress responses themselves seems reasonable investigate more thoroughly how moral decisions influenced different types stress
moral decision making experimental-laboratory studies frequently assessed moral dilemmas trolley problem modified versions
trolley problem subdivided into switch dilemma footbridge dilemma
switch dilemma people judge whether morally acceptable divert runaway trolley onto side track where will kill only one person whereas five other people being saved
footbridge dilemma only way save five people runaway trolley push someone off footbridge onto railway-which will stop trolley but will inevitably kill person being pushed
decision sacrifice one person order save lives group people called utilitarian because maximizes overall benefit amongst all individuals involved
according several authors utilitarian judgments particularly related controlled cognitive processes whereas non-utilitarian judgments particularly related automatic emotional responses
most people deliver utilitarian judgment switch dilemma but not footbridge dilemma because footbridge dilemma perceived emotionally more aversive entails high personal involvement
dilemmas footbridge dilemma termed personal because agent take direct action pushing individual off bridge dilemmas switch dilemma existing threat deflected agent termed impersonal
response latencies making decision differ respect kind dilemma kind choice personal dilemmas participants typically need longer make utilitarian judgment than non-utilitarian judgment
results emphasize conflict between spontaneous emotional decisions not direct agent someone's death deliberative utilitarian judgment maximizing overall profit
mentioned before moral dilemmas elicit stress responses
but then there also evidence stress affects simple non-moral decision making measured neuropsychological gambling tasks iowa gambling task game dice task
task performance based emotional learning processes processing feedback gains losses previous trials strategy application calculating most advantageous decisions
stress related decision making leads disadvantageous results long run individual stress responses related disadvantageous decisions
recent study investigated moral decisions after exposure well known psychosocial stress task youssef et al press using cortisol measures stress indicator
participants were either exposed trier social stress test participants deliver speech solve arithmetic task front committee control condition
subsequently they responded subset aforementioned moral dilemmas developed greene et al were either personal impersonal each offering utilitarian non-utilitarian decision alternative
youssef et al found participants exposed stress made fewer utilitarian judgments personal dilemmas individual stress response was negatively related number utilitarian judgments
they concluded stress inhibited cognitive control processes necessary making utilitarian judgments
based theoretical empirical background current study aimed replicate generalize significant findings youssef et al different kind stressor i e cover-story anticipated speech different kind stress measurement i e heart rate
both heart rate cortisol levels established stress indicators heart rate associated fast-reacting neural path also referred sympathetic adrenomedullary system cortisol reactions associated slower hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis
trier social stress test been shown activate both systems anticipated speech been shown activate sympathetic adrenomedullary system and-to lesser degree-the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis too
our study was created generalize results yielded youssef et al different methods
