 
conducted three studies investigate how well pictographs communicate medical screening information persons higher lower numeracy skills
study number conducted number probability level higher vs lower x number reference information yes vs no x number subjective numeracy higher vs lower between-subjects design
persons higher numeracy skills were influenced probability level but not reference information
persons lower numeracy tended differentiate between higher lower probability when there was no reference information
study number consisted interviews about mental processing pictographs
higher numeracy was associated counting icons relying numbers depicted graph
study number was experiment same design study number but rather than using reference information varied sequence task type counting first vs non-counting first explore role focus numerical information
persons lower numeracy differentiated between higher lower risk only when they were non-counting first condition
task sequence did not influence risk perceptions persons higher numeracy
sum our results suggest pictographs may useful persons higher lower numeracy
however groups seem process graph differently
persons higher numeracy rely more numerical information depicted graph whereas persons lower numeracy seem confused when they guided towards numbers
 introduction 
patients often confronted difficult medical decisions
many decisions made based numerical information
therefore quite important information understood correctly
past research shown many people difficulties understanding numerical risk information persons low numeracy skills ability understand numbers especially challenged numerical information
therefore not surprisingly more more studies show low numeracy associated less understanding medical information unfavorable decision outcomes
different solutions been proposed improving communication medical information
some authors suggest example numbers should expressed frequencies especially persons low numeracy conveyed graphs
one special type graph combines two recommendations risk communication because graph shows frequency information b conveys numbers purely graphical way
so-called pictographs show number people affected certain medical condition larger group people
therefore type graph seems promising tool communicating medical information persons low numeracy
several studies show pictographs help people low numeracy understand medical information
however although pictographs seem improve low-numerates' direct understanding presented numbers e g knowledge how many persons affected certain disease not yet clear how graph influences low-numerates' risk perception
influence pictographs risk perception however may crucial because perceiving risk either high low might greater impact behavioral intentions than understanding numerical information alone
generally pictographs seem evoke lower risk perceptions than other presentation formats paling perspective scale numerical frequencies
unfortunately not possible decide whether reported risk perception correct one because subjective nature
handle difficulty one conduct experiment investigate whether different levels probabilities evoke different levels perceived risk
approach participants faced either higher lower probability then estimate their perceived risk
then analyze extent participants confronted higher risk perceive risk higher than participants confronted lower risk
results two previous studies following procedure using pictographs showed higher probability did not evoke higher level perceived risk than lower probability
result might suggest although some studies showed pictographs seem help persons low numeracy understand numbers depicted graph pictographs may not help them evolve clearly distinguishable risk perceptions same degree
thus type task used study may influence evaluation pictographs
role numeracy perception process our knowledge not yet fully understood
therefore conducted three studies examine influence numeracy people's perceptions new approach question people's processing numerical medical information depicted pictographs
examine issue chose context cancer screening test results some studies shown numeracy important area
numeracy defined person's ability understand process numerical concepts
measured two different ways
objective measures assess people's numeracy letting them solve mathematical tasks
one problem using objective measures mail-in surveys respondents might use helping devices calculators
would then bias resulting numeracy score
furthermore respondents might find annoying fill questionnaires thus might simply avoid them when they opportunity do so
cope problem fagerlin colleagues developed subjective numeracy scale assesses self-reported numeracy skills
measure offers advantage shorter administration less reluctance participants than objective measures
other hand measure relies entirely self-reported numerical ability preference
moreover although positively correlated objective numeracy does not measure exactly same construct direct measurement mathematical skills objective numeracy measures
short aim our first study was examine influence subjective numeracy perception cancer screening test results presented pictographs
following siegrist keller's approach conducted experiment examine whether different levels probabilities evoke different levels perceived risk
reach deeper understanding into how pictographs might influence risk perception relation numeracy conducted second study
thereby directly examined processing cancer screening results depicted pictographs its association numeracy
finally study number explored role sequence task numerical understanding first vs risk perception first context risk communication pictographs numeracy
manifold procedure aim broaden existing knowledge about numeracy medical decisions investigating role numeracy risk perception
