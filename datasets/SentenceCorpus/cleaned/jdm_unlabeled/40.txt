so far nothing like remotely sight i don't expect ever will
however i still believe decision aiding prescriptive decision analysis particular become major force good world but will take upheaval how decision tools fashioned how they used
won't come about spontaneously because root problem not technique but motivation notoriously difficult correct
today i want talk about how make decision aiding more successful making usefulness top priority decision aiding community among decision researchers particular
lot important decision research being done but not very much helping decision aiding get used useful
i think turned around but won't easy
