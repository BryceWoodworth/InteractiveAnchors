demonstrate individuals more precise mental-number-line representations higher numeracy number skills consistent previous research children
individuals more precise representations compared those less precise representations also were more likely choose larger later amounts over smaller immediate amounts particularly larger proportional difference between two monetary outcomes
addition they were more likely choose option larger proportional but smaller absolute difference compared those less precise representations

 introduction 
intuitive representations mental number line defined nonverbal representations numerosity spontaneously activated presence numeric information regardless format
representations inner marks allow verbal nonverbal animals think unnamed numbers
trained monkeys example order objects number  number their numerosity
adult humans perform arithmetic operations quickly larger arrays dots using nonverbal mental magnitudes
number domain prime example where strong evidence points biologically determined domain-specific representation number elementary arithmetic operations linked inferior parietal cortex specifically horizontal intra-parietal sulcus both adults children
arabic spelled-out spoken numerals all activate area so thought involved cross-modal representation manipulation quantity meaning numbers rather than being activated any specific number notation
numerical-cognition researchers believe basic numerical intuition lays foundation uniquely human mathematical reasoning
number intuitions however limited their representational power do not directly support concepts fractions probabilities even precise numbers important many decisions
although little research exists processing more sophisticated concepts thought based nonetheless humans' basic number sense brain areas originally developed other purposes co-opted nonintuitive symbolic number processing
goal paper develop test hypotheses about influence evolutionarily ancient intuitive numbers human decisions
numerical information ubiquitous decisions guide our lives generally assumed if provided appropriate numbers people will numerate enough understand use them intended
less numerate individuals however fare less well important medical financial decisions involving numeric information
