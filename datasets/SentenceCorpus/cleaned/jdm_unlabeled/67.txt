when forecasts expressed clarity then quantitative measures scoring rules calibration discrimination etc
used measure forecast accuracy turn used measure comparative accuracy different forecasting methods
unfortunately most real world forecasts not expressed clearly
lack clarity extends both description forecast event use vague language express forecast certainty
thus difficult assess accuracy most real world forecasts consequently accuracy methods used generate real world forecasts
paper addresses deficiency presenting approach measuring accuracy imprecise real world forecasts using same quantitative metrics routinely used measure accuracy well-defined forecasts
demonstrate applicability inferred probability method applied measure accuracy forecasts fourteen documents examining complex political domains
 introduction 
forecasting accuracy determination practices methods tools improve accuracy topic substantial research practical importance
when endeavoring measure forecast accuracy researchers generally require forecasted events clearly described degree forecast certainty expressed quantitative probabilities
contrast forecasting research most published forecasts describe forecast events considerable imprecision use vague certainty expressions
particularly true forecasts about complex international political events substantive domain interest us
consider example statement stratfor forecasts number iran it's rather difficult gauge what meant fair chance
number percent chance number percent chance perhaps number percent chance
if event occurs would unclear if should judged mostly accurate inaccurate forecast
consider also following statement stratfor iran number forecast addition fact different individuals vary widely their interpretation word likely phrase backing down itself hard define
if there negotiated settlement does mean iran backed down other parties backed down settlement was found where everyone could claim success
cases difficult specify clear criteria priori determining whether not event occurred
anecdotally authors forecasting documents expressed us vigorous arguments favor imprecise forecasts
they believe clarity requirements severely limit their ability express what they intend say
example phrase backing down succinctly describes important element forecast event-namely individuals involved will accepting option less desirable than their expressed preference
addition many forecasters prefer verbal certainty expressions quantitative uncertainties because they believe later connotes artificial precision misleads readers
though there may valid reasons expressing forecasts imprecisely there still need evaluate forecast accuracy
research expert political judgment would suggest lacking objective feedback accuracy their forecasts experts unlikely accurately determine when their forecasts were inaccurate
particular given hindsight memory bias would anticipate forecasters will remember certainty statements fair chance having meant low probability when event didn't occur high probability when event did occur
furthermore without measuring accuracy real world forecasts difficult compare accuracy different forecasting methods outside artificial research settings-and unfortunately results artificial research settings widely ignored practitioners
distinction between academic research practice well illustrated fourteen years research political analysts summarized tetlock
every research effort described tetlock involved constructing carefully defined forecasting questions asking analysts provide quantitative forecasts
forecasts analysts actually published were not examined
paper describe method measuring accuracy imprecise forecasts
our objective add sufficient rigor evaluation imprecise forecasts enable application common metrics forecast accuracy forecasts actually published
our approach incorporates two basic techniques inferred probabilities impartial ground truth judgments
first use inferred probabilities impute quantitative probabilities verbal expressions certainty
simply put ask multiple readers assign quantitative probabilities based their understanding written document rather than their personal beliefs
second ask multiple ground truth raters who do not see original documents inferred probabilities independently research estimate whether not forecasted event occurred
addition needed use inter rater agreement data statistically adjust estimated ground truth frequencies
below present details our current instantiation inferred probability method
