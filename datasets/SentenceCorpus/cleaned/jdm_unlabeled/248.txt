 
people tend overestimate emotional responses future events
study examined whether affective forecasting errors occur feelings regret measured self-report subsequent decision-making
some participants played pricing game lost narrow wide margin while others were asked imagine losing margins
participants who experienced narrow loss reported more regret than those who imagined narrow loss
furthermore those experiencing narrow loss behaved more cautiously subsequent gambling task
thus study provides self-report behavioral evidence reversal affective forecasting phenomenon feelings regret
 introduction 
people want happy when confronted decision they'd rather choose path joy than path misery
if only were simple
one problem paths rarely labeled instead people imagine feelings outcome their decisions would trigger
although people relatively skilled at predicting how certain outcome will make them feel they less skilled at predicting intensity duration those emotions
you guess getting tenure will make you happy but elation will dissipate faster than you would imagine
asymmetry between anticipating experiencing emotions been studied laboratory well natural settings under banner affective forecasting
typical laboratory study affective forecasting participants first report their general happiness next engage some experimental procedure uncertain outcome
finally some participants asked predict how happy they would feel after receiving particular outcome while others told outcome first then asked report happiness they experience
allows researchers measure extent anticipated experienced feelings depart baseline level happiness reported at beginning session
typical result participants overestimate duration their forecasted emotions leads them overestimate how intense their feelings will some time after outcome
example when asked imagine how they would feel number minutes after losing money gambling task people predict more unhappiness than unhappiness they experience number minutes after actually losing
people also overestimate intensity their initial reaction
considerable evidence accumulated over last number years support basic finding people overestimate impact future events will their emotional response
most studies equated emotional response changes valence
example some studies asked participants report their happiness scale ranging not happy very happy
other studies asked participants report intensity several different emotions those reports were later converted into composites scores positive negative valence
emphasis pleasant unpleasant dimension proved useful study affective forecasting
however approach also begs question whether forecast bias extends beyond pleasant unpleasant dimension include biases when predicting intensity specific emotions
know people relatively skilled at predicting specific emotions e g anger fear disgust etc
they will experience different situations
know less about how accurate people at predicting intensity duration those specific emotions
few studies started examine question particularly feeling regret
current study another step direction
regret defined negative cognitively based emotion experience when realizing imagining our present situation would been better had decided differently
thus regret unique among emotions its reliance counterfactual thinking if i had chosen differently then things would turned out better
when counterfactuals readily available regret seems grow more intense
example people's intuition poor choices most regretful when they unusual choices those cases conventional approach readily available counterfactual
similar reason people believe they will experience more regret when desired outcome narrowly missed than when missed wide margin
presumably loss narrow margin highlights unfulfilled success
consequence people believe missing flight number minutes should cause more regret than missing hour
psychologists shared same intuition over number years
intuition narrow margins loss highly effective at triggering regret been challenged recent study affective forecasting
naturalistic setting people who missed subway narrow margin reported no more regret than those who missed wide margin
result was stark contrast predictions people made when interviewed before train arrived
finding was replicated experimental setting
new set participants was recruited play game inspired tv show price right
before starting game participants were asked report their emotional state at time including report their level regret disappointment
next people were asked rank several household products price
participants had create two arrangements exemplified their two best guesses then proceeded choose best one opportunity win prize
some participants were asked predict how much regret they would feel if they were find out correct arrangement was one they did not choose narrow margin loss
condition aimed experimentally recreate situation participant asked imagine having narrowly missed desired outcome e g catching subway
participants' predictions condition were compared actual feelings regret reported participants who actually experienced narrow margin loss
other participants were asked predict how much regret they would feel if they found out neither two arrangements was correct wide margin loss
hypothesized authors study participants predicted they would feel more regret after losing narrow margin but reality they did not
other words there was asymmetry between amount regret anticipated amount regret experienced
results were consistent theory affective forecasting received substantial empirical support over years
at same time some aspects experimental design cast doubt generalizability findings
particular participants gilbert et al 's study were offered consolation prize after being told they had lost
small prize may helped participants re-conceptualize loss minor win thus reducing amount regret experienced
fact previous research shows people recover most quickly negative events when easier them rationalize outcome their favor
thus absence consolation prize might lead very different pattern results one experience regret stronger than anticipated
our study tested hypothesis
another limitation number study gilbert et al its reliance self-report measure
while approach been validated basic emotions happiness its use assessing more complex emotions regret matter debate
asking people directly report how much regret they feeling assumes people easily associate their feelings verbal label
although some researchers claim indeed possible others argue direct questioning fails discriminate regret other negative emotions disappointment
furthermore self-report measures subject possible carry-over effects when same emotion probed twice often case studies affective forecasting
one way overcome limitations self-report measures explore influence regret future behavior
some researchers argued emotions general regret particular exist sake guiding behaviors
many choices people make aim minimize experience regret anticipation regret serves deter risk taking
merely imagining regretful consequences our potential actions sometimes enough make us decide differently
thus measuring risky behavior after narrow loss should possible us assess whether experiencing imagining narrow loss more effective triggering emotion
explored possibility variant gambling task first introduced slovic our participants completed after participating price right task
participants viewed ten cards face down computer screen instructions nine cards were good i e selecting any them would earn participant dollar per card but one cards was disaster card i e choosing would cause loss every dollar collected up point end game
following instructions participant reported how many cards they would like turn
after turning initial number cards participants made second more important decision
they had decide whether stop walk away money continue pick one more card chance win another dollar
thus opportunity winning relatively small prize was pitted against risk losing larger amount i e regret prone situation
sum using self-report behavioral measures regret aimed show absence consolation prize experience regret larger than anticipated
