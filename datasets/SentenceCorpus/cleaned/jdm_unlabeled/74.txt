cr implies decision makers prefer alternatives exhibit concordant ranks between attribute values attribute weights
show situations where alternatives equal multi-attribute utility mau minimization weighted euclidean distance wed ideal alternative implies choice cr alternative
two experiments participants chose among well evaluated alternatives were constructed equal mau
experiment number four alternatives were designed way choice each alternative would consistent one particular choice strategy one was cr strategy
experiment number participants were presented cr alternative number arbitrary alternatives
both experiments participants tended choose cr alternative
cr alternative was average evaluated more attractive than other alternatives
addition measures wed between given alternatives ideal alternative large agreed preference order choices attractiveness evaluations different types alternatives
findings indicate both choices attractiveness evaluations guided proximity alternatives ideal alternative
 introduction 
modern consumer society involves many decision situations one alternative needs chosen set several fairly attractive alternatives
true large investments purchase car home but also everyday consumer choices deciding what eat
all choice situations there might several alternatives cannot easily discarded
indeed fundamental feature market economies offer several alternatives attractive at least some people some times depending their different tastes monetary constraints
thus there markets attractive luxury cars attractive budget cars so
usually decision makers find promising alternative serves candidate final choice may checked more less thoroughly differentiated other alternatives before making final choice
they look through car ads browse website homes sale may quickly find promising alternative
ability make quick choices helps consumer solve life puzzles because lack time fundamental feature modern consumer society
present paper concerned strategies people use situations
how do people quickly find most promising alternative out several fairly attractive alternatives difficult differentiate each other respect their overall attractiveness
suggest situations individuals will choose alternative close their ideal alternative
manifests itself using strategy call concordant-ranks strategy cr
according strategy decision makers choose alternative there concordance between rank-order attribute values importance weights attributes provided overall attractiveness alternatives approximately equal
study choices test validity cr strategy presented participants individually tailored alternatives choose each constructed approximately equal attractiveness
assuming multi-attribute utility mau could used approximate indicator alternative attractiveness alternatives were constructed they were equal mau based attributes attribute weights participants generated themselves
study focused how participants quickly find promising alternative i e tentative preliminary choice rather than how they build up complex argumentation structure justify final choice
