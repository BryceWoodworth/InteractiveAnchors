 introduction 
within decision making literature there exist many interesting decision theories both normative descriptive defined deterministically
theories hereafter termed decision strategies not defined terms random variables therefore do not explicitly account fluctuations choice decision maker dm
yet many researchers observed dms not deterministically consistent their observed choices across repeated comparisons same stimuli set choice type
variability choice does not disappear over repeated experimental sessions same subject nor attributed entirely random responses learning experience effects
many researchers suggested different methods incorporating stochastic specification deterministic decision strategies accommodate variability choice
perhaps simplest stochastic specification add fixed level error dm's responses
trembling hand stochastic specification assumes dm follows single strategy imperfectly some probability incorrectly selecting choice alternative not truly preferred
other specifications class thurstonian fechnerian models treat preference deterministic model choice adding random variable representing noise
another class stochastic specifications those incorporate multiple decision strategies choice modeled sampling process over set strategies
there course many variations combinations above specifications well
further complicating matters choice stochastic specification use not innocuous one
hey recently argued different specifications lead different conclusions same set decision strategies urged should not silent about noise when evaluating decision strategies
article present new strategy classification framework evaluates set candidate strategies over multiple types stochastic specification
consider single strategy error specifications well probabilistic mixtures strategies using modern model selection criteria directly compare different models one another retaining optimal strategy-specification pair set observed choice data
thus our framework assigns not only best-fitting strategyies dm's choices but also best-fitting stochastic specification
illustrate our classification framework simulation study considers three different decision strategies over four types stochastic specification
also apply our framework existing empirical data set collected test transitivity preference axiom
throughout article will concerned classification strategies dms using outcome-based choice data perspective often referred comparative model fitting
how one carry out strategy classification via choice data
at most basic level researcher could classify strategies simply counting number times strategy was accordance observed data thereby ignoring problem stochastic specification altogether
however accordance rate approach lead significant biases strategy classification
hilbig demonstrates how practices lead theoretical confoundings uninterpretable data
regenwetter et al provides critique related practice evaluating strategies modal pair-wise majority
more recent approaches leveraged statistical models carry out strategy classification
broder schiffer developed methodology built binomial multinomial statistical framework models dms utilizing single strategy some fixed probability making error
under framework strategy classification likelihood-based carried out calculating comparing bayes factor scores
basic approach been successfully applied memory-based multiattribute choice decision making under risk paradigms
glockner generalizes approach incorporating any number additional measures decision time confidence data into likelihood function allow theories identical predictions at choice level distinguished see also bergert nosofsky glockner
approaches share similar assumption all dms utilize same stochastic specification
tackle problem dms following different stochastic specifications loomes et al adapted non-nested likelihood ratio test evaluate set candidate strategies under various stochastic specifications
comprehensive set studies they found dms were best fit variety stochastic specifications mixture specification strategies consistent expected utility yielding excellent fit many dms
non-nested likelihood ratio test however asymptotic test may lack statistical power when applied small samples
nor does non-nested likelihood ratio test provide explicit measure model complexity
article generalize strategy classification framework broder schiffer considering multiple stochastic specifications decision strategies including probabilistic mixtures multiple strategies
while many specifications possible under our framework will restrict ourselves three specifications described table number applications article
specifications were chosen their theoretical relevance tversky data set section number well showcase generality our approach
apply latest operationalization minimum description length principle normalized maximum likelihood carry out model selection among all strategy-specification pairs
normalized maximum likelihood information-theoretic model selection criteria evaluates models based upon ratio model's goodness-of-fit its complexity adhering occam's razor favoring simplest model provides good account data
