contrast little known about interindividual differences preferences larger versus smaller choice sets let alone causes differences
drawing self-efficacy theory two studies examined role decision-making self-efficacy preferences choice
using correlational approach study number n number found decision-making self-efficacy was positively associated preferences choice across range consumer decisions
association was found both between within-subjects
study number n number experimentally manipulated decision-making self-efficacy incentive-compatible choice among photo printers
preferences choice pre-choice information seeking were significantly lower low-efficacy condition compared high-efficacy condition control group

 introduction 
supermarket hospital consumers faced more choice than ever before
previous research phenomenon focused almost exclusively consequences having more versus less choice
contrast very few studies investigated preferences choice how much choice people actually want
limited research area suggests while larger choice sets generally more enticing there significant inter intra-individual differences
empirically preferences choice were found vary across decision domains age groups even nationalities
although underlying mechanisms drive preferences choice not been systematically explored converging evidence points key role decision-making self-efficacy dmse
drawing self-efficacy theory present research employs correlational study number experimental approaches study number systematically examine proposed link between dmse preferences choice
self-efficacy refers belief one's ability succeed given task drives individuals prefer more challenging tasks persist more face challenges
two streams recent empirical work suggest dmse entails confidence ability make effective decisions may affect preferences choice
first individuals higher versus lower dmse prefer decisions more challenging complex seek more information when making decisions
latter effect been demonstrated across multiple domains ranging consumer choices career selection health-related decisions
since dmse engenders preferences complex decisions increased information information complexity part parcel increased choice plausible dmse would also associated preferences larger choice sets
additional support notion stems finding individuals prefer more choice when decisions relatively simple compared more challenging-conditions theory generate high versus low levels dmse respectively
example individuals more likely prefer larger versus smaller choice sets when there fewer versus more attributes consider when dominating alternatives present versus absent
one study involving hypothetical decisions among consumer products demonstrated individuals prefer larger assortments when they assume options within assortments will ordered based their preferences i e most least preferred versus not
similar vein individuals prefer increased choice when their choice-relevant preferences highly accessible
combination findings suggest individuals prefer more choice when they expect able make effective decisions
although previous research consistent predictions derived self-efficacy theory association between dmse preferences choices has-to best our knowledge-not been systematically examined
address research gap conducted two studies investigate role dmse consumer decision making
study number examined correlations between self-report measures dmse preferences choice across multiple consumer domains
study number assessed effect experimental manipulations dmse preferences choice information-seeking complex decision scenario realistic outcomes
