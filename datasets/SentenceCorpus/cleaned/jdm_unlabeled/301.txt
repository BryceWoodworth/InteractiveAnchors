studies number number b college students community respondents were presented variations traditional moral scenario asked whether was permissible sacrifice one innocent man order save greater number people
political liberals but not relatively more conservative participants were more likely endorse consequentialism when victim had stereotypically white american name than when victim had stereotypically black american name
study number found evidence suggesting participants believe moral principles they endorsing general nature when presented sequentially both versions scenario liberals again showed bias their judgments initial scenario but demonstrated consistency thereafter

study number participants primed patriotism were more likely endorse consequentialism when iraqi civilians were killed american forces than were participants primed multiculturalism

implications role reason moral judgment discussed
 introduction 
most people believe harming innocent children wrong cheating exam breaking promise
more controversially some people believe abortion wrong death penalty unjust animals should not killed eaten
moral judgments unlike other social judgments important way
not only do believe our moral judgments correct but believe unlike our attitudes toward say chocolate ice cream everyone else should agree us
not only been pointed out philosophers key component moral beliefs but also confirmed psychologists important feature lay moral intuition
however problem arises when defending moral judgments
defending moral judgment appealing our subjective preferences e g abortion wrong because i don't like unpersuasive inasmuch fails provide compelling reason why others should agree
yet some philosophers argued moral claims seem lack obvious set objective criteria demonstrate their truth
features make disagreement moral domain tricky problem
what individuals often do however defend specific moral judgment appealing general moral principle
principles defined general rules guide judgment across wide variety situations making moral judgments appear less like ad hoc preferences more like rational facts
moral reasoning principle serves first step toward drawing specific conclusion
once there agreement about principle assessing whether specific moral claim instantiation principle all remains
course there been significant debate within moral philosophy what principles should endorsed
one central debates normative ethics been between advocates consequentialism deontology
consequentialism holds acts morally right wrong degree they maximize good consequences
many deontologists other hand while accepting consequences important believe there constraints against certain actions independent their consequences  some acts wrong in-and-of themselves
constraints generally include duties obligations injunctions not break promises not lie not harm innocent others
debate between two camps generated number well-known thought experiments where two broad principles pitted against each other one moral decision
adopting scenarios use laboratory psychological research suggested lay persons find distinction between consequentialist deontological considerations meaningful
indeed research utilizing scenarios demonstrated certain features act e g whether harm direct indirect reliably influence moral judgments consistent either consequentialist deontological moral ethic
what propose here however even when utilizing scenarios been shown reliably elicit consequentialist deontological intuitions people's moral judgments often affected set other motivations desire protect their ideological beliefs
consistent large body evidence showing reasoning processes heavily influenced motivational factors people flexible principles they apply justify their decisions
