 
compare four different risk-taking propensity measures their ability describe predict actual risky behavior domain health
risk-taking propensity measures compare number general measure risk-taking propensity derived one-item survey question number risk aversion index calculated set incentivized monetary gambles number measure risk taking derived incentive compatible behavioral task-the balloon analog risk task number composite score risk-taking likelihood health domain domain-specific risk taking dospert scale
study participants number clients health centers around witbank south africa
our findings suggest one-item general measure best predictor risky health behavior our population predicting two out four behaviors at number percent level remaining two behaviors at number percent level
dospert score health domain performs well predicting one out four behaviors at number percent significance level two out four behaviors at number percent level but only if dospert instrument contains hypothetical risk-taking item similar actual risky behavior being predicted
incentivized monetary gambles behavioral task were unrelated actual health behaviors they were unable predict any risky health behaviors at number percent level
provide evidence not because participants had trouble understanding monetary trade-off questions performed poorly behavioral task
conclude urging researchers further test usefulness one-item general measure both explaining health related risk-taking behavior other contexts
 introduction 
risk taking part life but people differ their risk-taking propensity
some people enjoy risky pursuits while others detest activities
psychologists economists developed various methods measure individual's risk-taking propensity
paper examines four different types risk-taking propensity measures tests how well they predict risk taking health domain smoking problem drinking seat belt non-use risky sexual behavior
first risk-taking propensity measure called dohmen measure paper was developed dohmen et al
elicited using one survey question directly asks about risk-taking propensity how do you see yourself
you generally person who fully prepared take risks do you try avoid taking risks
please tick box scale where value number means 'not at all willing take risks' value number means 'very willing take risks'
while straightforward simple administer dohmen measure been subject two concerns
first concern relates domain specificity
generally accepted psychology behavior domain specific possible individuals show different levels risk-taking propensity depending context
thus dohmen measure being general measure may not able predict risk taking health domain example
concern greatly mitigated dohmen et al who showed general dohmen measure robust predictor behavior different domains including smoking behavior health domain
second concern dohmen measure its lack incentive compatibility
issue derives general concern economists about incentive-compatible measures respondents presumed work harder more persistently more effectively when money aligned performance
case measuring people's risk-taking propensity incentive compatibility usually achieved giving respondents choices between gambles paying them what they choose
because dohmen question does not provide incentives motivate respondents answer truthfully respondents may misrepresent their answers
charness viceisza instance administered dohmen question rural senegal found resulting distribution answers differ significantly found dohmen et al germany
authors implied not having aligned incentives was reason discrepancy between measures found senegal germany but authors also alluded issues related translation difficulties including lack equivalent word risk wolof main national language senegal
second risk-taking propensity measure called hl measure paper was developed holt laury
hl most common measure individual's risk-taking propensity economics literature
participant hl makes ten separate choices between gambles where each choice entails choosing between risky gamble where high low payoffs r number r number respectively our study safer gamble where high low payoffs respectively r number r number
probability obtaining high vs low payoff risky gamble same probability obtaining high vs low payoff safer gamble
probability ranges number number number increments number number ten sets choices
when probability high payoff high at number number respondent high chance ending up r number under risky option r number under safer option case only very risk averse would choose safer option
point at respondent switches safer option risky option used calculate risk aversion index
because one choice pairs randomly selected played real after respondent made all number choices respondent knows about before making any choices hl measure incentive-compatible
because hl measure derived using monetary gambles unclear whether measure derived monetary domain related risky health behavior
question not been widely studied
anderson mellor using sample almost number number mostly college-educated respondents u s found hl measure associated smoking heavy drinking seat belt non-use-but only at number percent significance level
lammers using sample about number college students south africa found hl measure unrelated condom use
third risk-taking propensity measure used paper bart behavioral risk task performed computer
task number trials
each trial begins un-inflated balloon screen
clicking computer mouse makes balloon grow bigger earns participant number cents per click
every balloon different pre-set level inflation before bursts participant does not know number clicks made before any balloon bursts
at any point during each trial participant stop clicking bank money earned trial computer makes slot-machine coin-dispensing sound
if however balloon over-inflated beyond its pre-set level balloon bursts money trial gone
at end task participant paid all money banked
bart task essence measures actual risk-taking propensity individual
because earnings feedback given after each trial either casino sound when money banked explosion noise if balloon bursts bart decisions made hot psychological state
hl decisions contrast made cold psychological state because actual earnings hl task revealed after all choices been made
dislich et al use term impulsive risk taking describe bart term reflective risk taking describe task similar hl
bart been shown associated psychological measures risk taking sensation seeking personality self-reported behavioral risks including smoking heavy drinking drug use sexual risk taking gambling stealing etc

however bart good predictor health related risk taking not consistent finding literature
reynolds et al found bart was uncorrelated study's self-reported personality measures related risk taking
gordon found bart uncorrelated attitudes towards risky driving
dean et al found smokers did not display greater risk taking bart than nonsmokers
klassen found bart was unrelated any alcohol consumption measures examined
our fourth measure uses modified version domain specific risk taking scale dospert developed weber et al
dospert asks about one's likelihood pursue various hypothetical but risky activities each five domains financial ethical health safety social recreational then aggregates activity-specific risk-taking propensity scores into domain-specific risk-taking propensity scores
contrast dohmen measure elicits single global risk-taking propensity
dospert domain scores been shown associated real-life risk taking activities within same domain
instance hanoch et al found smokers had significantly higher risk-taking propensity scores health domain than respondents comparison group consisting gym members athletes gamblers investors
zuniga bouzas found dospert health safety recreational risk-taking scores significantly predicted blood alcohol concentrations mexican high-school students
current study examine dohmen hl bart dospert measures population clients at health clinics south africa test how measures relate health risk taking terms smoking drinking seat belt non-use risky sexual practices
our study makes few contributions
extend work dohmen et al testing how one-item measure fares predicting unhealthy behavior other than smoking
test ability incentive-based hl bart tasks explaining activities health domain using implementation hl task may interest other researchers addresses concerns about respondent understanding risk task
