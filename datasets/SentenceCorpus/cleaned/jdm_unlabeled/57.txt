 
ratio-bias phenomenon observed psychologist seymour epstein colleagues systematic manifestation irrationality
when offered choice between two lotteries individuals consistently choose lottery greater number potential successes even when offers smaller probability success
current study conduct experiments confirm phenomenon test existence bias distinct general irrationality
moreover examine effect introducing monetary incentive varying size depending treatment extent irrational choices within framework
confirm existence bias
moreover existence incentive significantly reduces extent irrationality exhibited effect roughly linear response changes size incentive within magnitudes investigated
 introduction 
consider following problem you asked draw red marble either two urns
urn contains number marbles number red
urn b contains number marbles number red
urn do you choose
rational actor maximizing probability choosing red marble will choose urn
psychologist seymour epstein colleagues documented many individuals choose urn b when presented choice similar choices
epstein named ratio-bias phenomenon appears individuals biased toward choices large numbers potential successes rather than large probabilities potential successes
present investigation explores ratio-bias phenomenon along two dimensions
first test errors within framework symmetric fashion
referring example above not only present participants decisions like one but also decisions urn larger number marbles greater probability success therefore optimal choice
if observe similar frequencies errors two circumstances then conclude there no real ratio-bias phenomenon but rather observation random error both directions
if frequency irrational decisions differs across treatments however then conclude ratio-bias phenomenon exists
second dimension interest incentives
participant ratio-bias experiment confronts decision well suited introduction small monetary incentive testing its marginal effect
implement combination within between-subjects design test effect monetary incentives decision making well varying size incentive test effect incentive magnitude decision optimality
