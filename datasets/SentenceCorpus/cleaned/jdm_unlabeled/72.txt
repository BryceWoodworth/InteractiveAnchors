first examines its generality analysing whether kind question being asked effect size potential gains
experimental results show question type matters
previous results reporting potential accuracy gains reproduced year-estimation questions extended questions about percentage shares
other hand no gains found general numerical questions
second part paper tests repeated judgment sampling's practical applicability asking judges provide third final answer basis their first two estimates
experiment majority judges do not consistently average their first two answers
result they do not realise potential accuracy gains averaging
 introduction 
imagine you been asked make quantitative judgment say somebody wants know when shakespeare's romeo juliet was first performed you might planning holiday alps wondering about elevation mont blanc
effective strategy answer questions make estimate average second judge friend colleague just about anybody else
what though if your colleague friend unavailable cannot give you second opinion
recent research suggests you could improve your answer bringing yourself make second estimate applying averaging principle your own two estimates
effectiveness suggestion however will depend both degree you able elicit two independent estimates yourself your willingness average them
previous research focused method used elicit second estimate
focus here lies type question being asked its interaction how successive estimates generated
i report experimental results different sets questions aim more representative quantitative judgments
i first reproduce previous results establish existence accuracy gains year-estimation questions what year were bacteria discovered

while i find similar gains questions about percentage shares e g percentage spanish homes access internet
i do not find evidence accuracy gains general numerical questions what distance kilometers between barcelona city hamburg germany
what average depth mediterranean sea

i then investigate whether difference explained degree answers various question types implicitly bounded but hypothesis not supported data
second factor whether judges actually recognise potential gains averaging behave accordingly
larrick soll argue people often do not understand properties benefits averaging procedures
my experimental data provide further evidence only small minority judges consistently average their estimates
often judges settle one their first two judgments final answer instead even extrapolate providing final answer lies outside range spanned their first two estimates
