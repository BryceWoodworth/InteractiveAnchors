 introduction 
almost four decades theoretical empirical work judgment decision making been inspired notion cognitive heuristics
accordingly people rarely try utilize all available information exhaustively making perfectly accurate judgments
they usually content non-optimal but satisficing solutions
cognitive tools afford satisficing solutions commonly called heuristics
their reputation improved enormously
having first been devalued mental short-cuts sloppy rules thumb sources biases shortcomings more recent literature heuristics often characterized fast frugal functional
simple heuristics make us smart were shown outperform more ambitious models rational inference simulation studies
yet addition mathematical proof simulation heuristics may perform well when they applied crucial psychological assumption says decision makers actually do use heuristics sometimes explained reflecting phylogenetic evolutionary learning
although correlational evidence correspondence simulated heuristic validity criterion sufficient study first functional aspect hypothesis testing about actual cognitive process supposed heuristic calls repertoire experimental cognitive psychology
thus crucial test assumption judgments frequency probability actually follow availability heuristic essential manipulate its crucial feature namely ease information comes mind
likewise cogent test anchoring heuristic shown judges actually adjust initial extreme anchor insufficiently
without appropriate experimental manipulations presumed mental operations impossible prove causal role hypothesized heuristic process
percentage focal heuristic's correct predictions judgments decisions cannot provide cogent distinct evidence about underlying process
early stage heuristics-and-biases research program though serious experimental attempts assess postulated cognitive operations had been remarkably rare
hardly any experiment had manipulated ease clearly specified retrieval operation supposed underlie availability heuristic gradual adjustment process supposed underlie anchoring heuristic
more recently though situation been changing
number fast frugal heuristics been specified precisely enough allow strict experimental tests underlying cognitive processes
tests take-the-best heuristic been concerned assumption cues ordered validity
research recognition heuristic tested whether comparative judgments really determined mere exposure rather than substantive evaluation comparison objects
seems fair conclude strict empirical tests resulted more critical picture validity scope postulated heuristics
