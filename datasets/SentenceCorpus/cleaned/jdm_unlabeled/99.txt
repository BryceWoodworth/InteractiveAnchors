labor markets constitute popular application body work particular emphasis how reciprocity helps regulate workplace relationships where managers unable perfectly monitor workers
study how idiosyncratic features labor market compared most scenarios reciprocity applies affect nature worker reciprocity
particular show how having excess supply workers simulating unemployment managers who observe reciprocal behavior workers hire fire them basis simulating reputational concerns inherent labor market transactions profoundly alters worker reciprocity
absence reputational concerns workers tend reward kind behavior punish unkind behavior managers approximately equal measure
presence reputational concerns workers exhibit marked increase decrease propensity reward kind punish unkind behavior managers
demonstrate how consequence workers managers responding changes strategic incentives reward punish
 introduction 
principle retaliation old mankind
far back hammarabian code some number years ago retaliation some form served organize behavior both market non-market situations
perhaps illustrating importance revenge most succinctly biblical injunction exodus number number  number life life eye eye tooth tooth bruise bruise
their part scholars explored importance negative actions alongside their seemingly more benign cousins positive actions
one key insights taken decades research within social sciences reciprocity general important negative actions toward individual induce greater behavioral response than comparable positive actions
stylized fact perhaps best illustrated words baumeister et al who provide broad survey several areas study examining positive negative reciprocity conclude p number  number italics added breadth convergence evidence however across different areas were striking forms most important evidence
no area were able find consistent reversal one could draw firm conclusion good stronger than bad
failure find any substantial contrary patterns occurred despite our own wishes efforts
hence must conclude bad stronger than good at pervasive general level
within economics results served classic example loss aversion  people more sensitive negative realizations than positive realizations uncertainty  played important role policymaking informed mechanism design
terms latter principal confronted interesting decision problem if framing incentive scheme matters agent behavior number instruments available principal constrained
manner choosing between carrots sticks example plays important role outcome
more generally scholars frequently remarked loss aversion represents one most robust general behavioral patterns social sciences
study explore general labor-market setting wherein economic theory provides predictions positive reciprocity should stronger than negative reciprocity
two key features agent short end market includes reputational considerations being out market provides less utility than being participant
under design worker respects her initial affective reaction punishes employer will find herself unemployed
alternatively worker who nice employer will more likely employed next period
since being employed dominates unemployment predict worker will restrain herself will not follow initial affective reaction
other hand if employer nice worker will reciprocate strongly since situation not only she employed but also nice employer
thus situation positive reciprocity will stronger than negative reciprocity
test our theory design simple controlled laboratory experiment yields several insights
first consonant literature agents reciprocate
when interactions anonymous negative reciprocity slightly more important than positive reciprocity but not significantly so
also consonant literature fact agents become emotionally charged when treated poorly
yet emotional charge does not readily transfer actions when realistic institutional features labor markets place
example when agents form reputations they respond much more acutely positive than negative stimuli
second data suggest source behavioral differences observed strategic rather than change social norm reciprocation gift exchange setting
