 introduction 
many behavioral scientists believe individuals make choices first assigning values objects then selecting option highest value perhaps some noise
raises several questions how values guide decisions henceforth called decision values computed
how values compared
what properties those processes
questions receiving increasing amounts attention psychology behavioral neuroscience neuroeconomics
particular several models how decision values computed compared been proposed
models based simple idea
decision value forecast made prior consumption actual value will derived consuming item
models assume decision values computed making repeated noisy estimates consumption value then integrated over time
interestingly some models received considerable empirical support both human behavioral monkey electrophysiology experiments
models make some striking predictions important behavioral economic implications
example they predict decision value assigned item thus willingness-to-pay depend amount time spent computing
series experiments testing prediction armel rangel showed willingness-to-pay appetitive items increases significantly computation time opposite true aversive items
krajbich armel rangel extended class models investigate role visual attention binary choice
their model described next section makes two stark predictions about impact choice exogenous changes visual attention
firt predicts should possible increase probability item chosen changing relative amount time subjects fixate item during decision-making process
second predicts effect should positive appetitive items negative aversive items
paper describes results three behavioral experiments testing predictions
large extent results consistent predictions
properties value computation comparison processes should interest behavioral scientists since they determine extent individuals able make quality choices circumstances they able do so
example results paper suggest incidental variables affect visual attention displays lighting conditions migh affect choices made
addition properties processes could important implications behavioral welfare effects practices in-store marketing
our work related literature construction preference behavioral economics marketing studied impact several incidental variables computation decision values
example weber kirsner asked subjects make choices between pairs lotteries graphical display compared two conditions one larger payoffs were depicted larger fonts one smaller payoffs were depicted larger fonts
they found subjects were more willing choose riskier gamble potentially larger payoffs first condition
common interpretation results outcomes larger font size received more attention lead relative overweithting those outcomes
related tversky kahneman argued s-shaped probability weighting function prospect theory driven perceptual biases place excessive relative attention very low very high probability events result overweighted relative mid-range probabilities
all results what manipulated relative attention received different dimensions choice problem e g probabilities gains
contrast paper show changes relative amount visual attention received entire items also affect likelihood they chosen
thus our results do not depend one dimension choice being overweighted at expense another but highlighted model described next section process relative value comparison favoring one option at expense other
our work also related literature mere exposure effect
typical experiment shows subjects' reports about how much they like seeing stimulus e g chinese ideogram foreign language word increased through repeated brief previous exposures items
there two important differences between mee processes studied paper
first mee about how previous exposures affect actual consumption experience seeing item whereas study how visual attention during process decision making affects choices made
thus whereas mee about impact repeated exposures learning across trials effect investigate about impact exposure time within single decision trial
second whereas mee defined ramping up positive liking ratings result consuming items even if they aversive our effect looks more like amplification effect positive appetitive items but negative aversive ones
far know first experimental study impact decisions exogenously explicitly manipulated fixation durations during process choice
closest experiment work shimojo et al who study role visual attention judgments about facial attractiveness
