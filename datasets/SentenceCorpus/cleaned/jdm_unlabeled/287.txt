 
some people find more difficult delay rewards than others
three experiments tested future self-continuity hypothesis individual differences perception one's present self continuous future self would associated measures saving laboratory everyday life
higher future self-continuity assessed novel index predicted reduced discounting future rewards laboratory task more matches adjectival descriptions present future selves greater lifetime accumulation financial assets even after controlling age education
addition demonstrating reliability validity future self-continuity index findings consistent notion increased future self-continuity might promote saving future
 introduction 
self-continuity represents one most enduring puzzles personal identity pondered ancient greek buddhist thinkers alike
if body changes over time  eventually being replaced entirely new material  at what point does old self become entirely new distinct being
self-continuity might vary individual some individuals endorsing greater connection their future selves than others
beyond philosophical appeal individual differences experience self-continuity could pragmatic consequences financial well-being
according one philosophical account if individuals consider their future selves different people they may no more reason reward future self than give resources strangers
continuous variant account called future self-continuity hypothesis predicts people who experience no continuity future self should not save future self
accordingly neural indices future self-continuity predict valuation future rewards assessed one week later
three experiments further explored future self-continuity hypothesis devising index individual differences future self-continuity examining whether would correlate valuation delayed rewards both laboratory tasks respect real-world savings
