also investigated psychometric properties several proposed refined versions scale
four sets analyses reported
first analysis confirms number part factor structure scale assesses its reliability
second analysis identifies those items do not perform well basis internal external judgmental criteria develops three shorter versions scale
third analysis three refined versions scale cross-validated confirm dimensionality reliability validity
fourth analysis uses experiment investment decision making context assess reliability nomological validity refined scales
analyses lead us conclude shorter number item maximization scale performs best should used future researchers
hoped clarification conceptual underpinnings maximization construct development refined scale will enhance its use among researchers across several social science disciplines
 introduction 
researchers long recognized decision making adaptive process individuals making tradeoffs between accuracy effort
however schwartz et al suggested tendency optimize when making decisions may manifest dispositional variable they formalized distinction between maximizers satisficers individual difference
whereas some people consistently try choose best others tend satisfice settle options simply good enough
schwartz his colleagues proposed difference may represent general behavioral tendency they developed scale capture distinction between decision makers who tend maximize those who tend satisfice
schwartz et al validated maximization scale across number survey experimental studies
was administered over number participants u s canada ranging age number number coming diverse ethnic backgrounds
results indicated maximizers tend pursue best option not simply option good enough constantly asking themselves best outcome rather than good outcome
addition examination relation between scores maximization scale range psychological correlates including regret happiness depression optimism self-esteem perfectionism neuroticism subjective well-being showed not only do maximizers exhibit different style decision-making satisficers but they also appear experience different emotional concomitants decisions
they experience higher levels regret dissatisfaction than satisficers less happy more depressed less optimistic than satisficers
they also more affected social comparison especially upward social comparison than satisficers
thus maximizing strategy seems not only associated choice process but also experience after choice been made perhaps including satisfaction life whole
phenomenon wherein context choice affects context experience elsewhere been referred leakage
iyengar her colleagues subsequently studied college seniors looking jobs found students possessing maximizing tendencies pursued more job opportunities obtained starting salaries almost number percent higher than those offered satisficers
despite their relative success however maximizers were less satisfied outcomes their job search more pessimistic stressed overwhelmed depressed job search process
other domains researchers examined impact maximization gift giving behavior retirement investing post-decisional regret
since maximization scale was first published been employed numerous studies different countries maximization construct appears growing interest researchers various domains
given increasing interest reexamination maximization scale its measurement properties warranted
current paper examines reliability factor structure validity maximization scale also proposes several refined shorter forms scale
development shorter forms maximization scale important because especially when maximization not focal interest research short scale will allow researchers include construct large multivariate studies without making survey instruments excessively long
perhaps more important existing maximization scale candidate refinement because both past research employing scale current set analyses reported below suggest original number item scale contains several items tend not perform well psychometrically thus should considered elimination
addition original schwartz et al study suggested scale could analyzed into three distinct factors  one reflecting choice difficulty one reflecting difficulty large numbers options one reflecting high standards
nothing been done since confirm existence three factors
further analysis warranted both because factors suggest different psychological processes because original schwartz et al results were less than ideal respect factor structure
analysis below suggests shorter number item version maximization scale not only performs adequately but actually performs at level superior original number item scale
also define more carefully examine three dimensions maximization reported schwartz et al conclude they differentially predictive various psychological characteristics respondents
therefore future researchers advised examine not only peoples' maximization scores but their sub-dimension scores well
having shorter yet more valid reliable instrument measure people's tendency maximize should enhance research efforts examine how people's tendencies maximize satisfice during choice process affect their decisions choices ultimately their happiness well-being
order re-examine original maximization scale develop refined shorter version exhibits superior psychometric properties conduct four sets analyses
analysis number examines internal consistency dimensional purity maximization scale using ten pre-existing datasets included maximization construct
analysis number uses same ten datasets develop refined shorter versions maximization scale number item number item number item versions
analyses number number independently establish reliability validity newly developed scales recommended smith et al analysis number cross-validate newly developed refined scales using ten datasets previously employed plus two new datasets analysis number collect additional data assess validate further newly developed refined maximization scales
bearden netemeyer summarized psychometric qualities sound measurement instrument content validity dimensionality internal consistency reliability construct validity
paper evaluate maximization scale using all criteria then develop several refined forms scale comparison purposes
process revising maximization scale followed set rules procedures consistent past work
our analyses rely internal external judgmental criteria proposed stanton et al
internal criteria relate internal consistency dimensionality measured construct external criteria explicitly concerned construct validity judgmental criteria deal assessment content validity readability
furthermore follow procedure recommended smith et al order avoid common sins short scale development
research presented here based analysis pre-existing datasets new data
there were number pre-existing datasets representing total over number number respondents were obtained several authors across several disciplines both u s overseas see table number
