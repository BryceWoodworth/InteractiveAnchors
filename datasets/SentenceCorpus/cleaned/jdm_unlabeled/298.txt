cognitive processes underlying impact bias methods correcting been debated warrant further exploration
present investigation examined both individual differences contextual variables associated cognitive processing affective forecasting election
results showed perceived importance event working memory capacity were both associated increased impact bias some participants whereas retrieval interference had no relationship bias
additionally experimental manipulation effectively reduced biased forecasts particularly among participants who were most distracted thinking about peripheral life events
findings theoretical implications understanding impact bias highlight importance individual differences affective forecasting ramifications future decision making research

 introduction 
benjamin franklin observed declaration independence doesn't guarantee happiness only pursuit
you catch up yourself
part pursuing happiness involves making predictions about endeavors events yield most desired outcomes
life-altering decisions contemplating who marry career pursue require reasoned predictions regarding long-term emotional benefits
when asked make affective forecasts people accurately predict direction valence their emotional reactions but show surprisingly poor ability predict intensity duration their anticipated feelings
more specifically people generally overestimate emotional impact future events phenomenon termed impact bias
people expect endless despair response romantic breakups enduring euphoria response winning lottery whereas reactions tend more fleeting than anticipated
although impact bias tends somewhat greater distressing events been found predictions both positive negative events including holidays final course grades tenure decisions housing assignments sports outcomes meals prize money missed train departures elections
because people often make decisions based their predicted emotional reactions impact bias leads frequent errors decision making
affective forecasting research highlighted importance assessing both predicted actual emotional reactions since one type reaction cannot merely taken proxy other
nonetheless due difficulty conducting biphasic investigations researchers often chosen examine forecasts only use between-group design predicted actual reactions event measured across different samples
fact meta-analysis currently underway indicates only small number n number number total forecasting studies used solid repeated-measures design same participants provided both predicted actual reactions same event
only two focused extensively non-demographic individual difference variables
although impact bias been described past researchers relatively general phenomenon study individual differences affective forecasting help reveal thought processes underlying impact bias
past research theory implicated working memory capacity proneness retrieval interference important individual difference variables may influence biased forecasts
present investigation repeated-measures design was used determine whether individual differences cognitive processing influence predicted reactions actual reactions both
furthermore attempted account core situational moderators impact bias namely use bias-reduction strategy well perceived importance event question
