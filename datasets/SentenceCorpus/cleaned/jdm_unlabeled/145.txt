paper evaluate hypothesis effect due illusion control induced causal framing situation
causal frames require action make difference outcome action precedes outcome
if illusion control modulates reluctance tempt fate then actions make difference well-being occur prior outcome should tempt fate most strongly
experiments number  number varied whether action makes difference temporal order action outcome
experiment number tested whether action tempt fate if all outcomes negative
results all four experiments supported our hypothesis tempting fate effect depends causal construal gives rise false sense control
 introduction 
risen gilovich shown taking action making decision presupposes certain state world make opposite state seem more likely even when action decision no real causal impact
example people judge leaving one's umbrella at home increases probability will rain
risen gilovich argue reluctance tempt fate occurs because action presupposes good outcome leads anticipated regret therefore draws attention disproportionally negative outcome
negative outcome then seems more likely because more available
paper elaborate risen gilovich's hypothesis specify conditions exacerbate attenuate feeling tempting fate
our claim not merely availability bad outcome makes seem more likely
rather reluctance tempt fate stems illusory causal belief action will influence outcome illusion control
further argue illusion control depends causal construal role one's action outcome
understand illusion control more than feeling taking action one bring about desired outcome when fact outcome due chance
take term control more general encompass any counterfactual dependency between action outcome including possible action bad outcome
our use term control denotes relation between variables not states variables
agent will feel control over outcome only if agent believes at some level his her action causal relation outcome
causality imposes certain requirements relations between actions outcomes
first action cause outcome action must make difference outcome
second action must precede outcome
people highly sensitive requirements therefore propose they experience reluctance tempt fate when there cues environment suggesting they should frame their actions causally specifically action potential make difference actor's well-being action precedes determination outcome
definition fate-tempting actions no real causal impact outcome question bringing leaving umbrella does not influence whether will rain
however actions affect well-being way depends uncontrolled outcome
instance decision leave umbrella at home weather jointly determine whether one gets wet
argue actions well-being joint function choice uncontrolled outcome likely inspire reluctance tempt because casual efficacy action leads sense control
contrast actions do not directly influence well-being will not seem tempt fate
use term make-a-difference denote choice interacts uncontrolled outcome determine well-being
temporal priority another fundamental property causal relations one people highly sensitive
morris sim girotto used principle provide evidence illusion control mediated choices prisoner's dilemma game
they compared behavior games where opponent had already chosen but what they chose was unknown cases where opponent had not chosen yet
people were more likely cooperate if their opponent had not chosen yet even though their own choice was unknown opponent
suggests decision-making was influenced belief at some level one's choice could influence opponent even though was unknown him her
similarly hypothesized feeling tempting fate will attenuated if outcome already been determined even if one lacks knowledge outcome
sum our hypothesis predicts feeling one tempting fate should strengthened when choice makes difference well-being uncontrolled outcome not yet been determined
first study manipulated both whether choice makes difference temporal order outcome decision test prediction
second study replicated first using different wording rule out alternative explanation
third study extended manipulation scenario adapted risen gilovich
fourth study examined whether choice must make difference matters
