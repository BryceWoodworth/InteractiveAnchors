 
research shown people perceive themselves less biased than others better than average many favorable characteristics
suggest types biased perceptions regarding intentions behavior others may directly affect people's decisions
current research focus possible influences context helping behavior
four experiments found people believe others compared themselves less inclined help cooperate less aware number bystanders more influenced proportion dominance bias identifiable victim effect
demonstrate perceptions naive unrealistic showing decisions both self others' perspectives equally biased
finally show how perspective decision made self vs others may affect private well public decisions ways might not best interest decision maker public
 introduction 
research judgment decision making recent decades shows because cognitive motivational biases individuals consistently rate themselves above average across variety domains positive traits behavior
bias known better than average bta effect
example kruger dunning found participants' self-rating their ability judge humor solve logic grammar problems was higher than average
they show tendency stronger among those who perform more poorly
bta belief been described illusory because group level majority people cannot better than average assuming normal distribution examined trait
studies people typically compare their characteristics behaviors performance norm standard average standing their reference group
bta bias greater when comparable target average student declines when target individuated
bta bias also salient people's evaluations judgments people believe their own judgments less susceptible biases than judgments others
they tend view their own decisions relying objective cues environment while other's judgments influenced more subjective self-serving features
naive realism idea suggests people assume their own views ideas perceptions reflect truth real world when others do not share their views they tend conclude others' views were subject bias misperceptions
although bta bias may serve individual enhancing self esteem may negative effect decisions when decision depends belief about others' behavior
example believing mistakenly other people won't donate certain cause might increase my willingness donate even when i can't afford
other hand thinking other people will help relying their expected help may inhibit intervention result no help will provided
perceptions what other people view best way act may influence decisions especially when involve public issues
public well public decision-makers prone same biases
contrast private decisions decisions regarding public policy often taken politicians civil servants affect thousands individuals
cost bad decisions because biased perception citizens' behavior attitudes opinions might very high
moreover public decision-makers politicians depend strongly public support one their main concerns when making decision public opinion how their decision will judged most people
biased perceptions public opinion preferences choices may thus negatively affect behavior individuals public decision-makers
one domain perceptions others' behavior judgments may critical influence one's own decisions decision act intervene situations when help needed
individuals often exposed situations their personal help needed directly indirectly
policy makers often consider policies require cooperation help public
self-other comparison not been studied domain although most likely people's judgments decisions concerning helping behavior affected their perceptions others
literature helping-behavior bystander intervention emphasizes other people's behavior given situation considerable influence one's own decision whether not intervene
not only people concerned about opinion others other people's behavior may also serve information regarding appropriate right thing do
example when person monitors reactions others situation where help needed s he may conclude others' lack initiative everyone believes intervention not critical thus not needed
person adopts what s he thinks norm behavior
perceptions regarding others' opinions behaviors accurate biased
individuals may misperceive their social groups larger social environments number ways influence their behavior
pluralistic ignorance one most common misperceptions
occurs when majority individuals falsely assumes most their peers behave think differently them when fact their attitudes behavior similar
pluralistic ignorance was suggested one explanation bystander effect individuals less likely offer help when other people present than when alone
pluralistic ignorance may thus cause lack intervention case when help needed demonstrating how other people's opinions behavior may direct influence decision act not act
another explanation bystander effect known diffusion responsibility
account lack intervention at least partially caused belief some people will act thus one's own action less necessary
other people's behavior may greater influence one's own decisions situations more ambiguous unfamiliar
recent research indicates idea how other people would act may influence decisions even without physical presence others
blair thompson wuensch demonstrated diffusion-of-responsibility phenomenon extends beyond face-to-face environments virtual presence many others significantly reduced e-mail responsiveness request help
both explanations bystander effect based assumption people specific beliefs about perceptions others though there been no direct effort test assumptions
present experiment directly test self-perceptions participants well their perceptions others context helping behavior
most people perceive helping others desirable behavior altruism superior characteristic
thus according bta effect people expected perceive themselves more willing help than average person
present research will examine bta effect also concerning biases context helping behavior intervention
two biases recently been studied context proportion dominance pd bias identifiable victim idv effect
do people perceive themselves less susceptible than others those two
regard proportion dominance studies shown people prefer risk-reducing intervention policy maximizes relative life-saving saving larger proportion population at expense absolute life-saving saving more lives
those studies demonstrate people tend choose options maximize relative life saving even when presented comparison absolute relative savings
preference incompatible normative model according value single life should same regardless size reference group
regard identified victim effect people more willing help identified victims victims about whom they some even if only minimal information than unidentified ones
situations when decision help involves biases expect decisions perspective self biased decisions average other people not aware bias
however when confronted bias assume bta mechanism will come into play resulting people believing others more biased than they themselves
naive belief about others opposed oneself may cause decision-makers choose alternative action not best their interest when behavior perceptions attitudes others relevant consideration often happens decisions concerning public policy
thus sum hypothesize people perceive themselves more willing help than average person at same time perceive others more prone biases context helping behavior than they
