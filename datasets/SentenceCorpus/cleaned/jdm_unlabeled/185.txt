 
experimental test descriptive adequacy restated diversification principle presented
principle postulates risk-averse utility maximizers will pool risks their mutual benefit even if information missing about probabilities losses
enough people assume they face equal risks when they pool risks
results experiment support principle
 introduction 
nutshell diversification principle says if risk-averse utility maximizers choose between two assets identical but random returns they will prefer invest half their endowment each asset
principle paraphrased following means if two risk-averse utility maximizers assets same value face same distributions potential losses they will gain sharing potential losses equally
restated diversification principle holds any distribution outcomes long distribution same both people
does not matter whether probability loss small large both cases people gain sharing loss
implies sharing loss also mutually favorable if information missing about probabilities losses
not even necessary distribution outcomes same both people enough they both accept there no reason assume their probabilities losses differ presumption equality
possible differences therefore neglected if there no knowledge about them
when information about probabilities losses missing mutual sharing losses may superior insurance since insurance premium normally based technical actuarial information probability losses
without information pricing will become arbitrary negotiation cost may large
insurance under apparent ambiguity when information about probabilities losses lacking may not possible at all
loss-sharing however undertaken without pricing potential loss
restated diversification principle was first presented skogh case two identical pool members
skogh wu generalized principle case where individuals' losses differ amount probability case where individuals' attitudes toward risks differ
paper tests descriptive adequacy restated diversification principle experiment
particular test following two hypotheses h number under apparent ambiguity people will share potential losses
h number if distribution potential losses different across people but unknown people will still share potential losses
experimental design results discussion presented sections number number number respectively
