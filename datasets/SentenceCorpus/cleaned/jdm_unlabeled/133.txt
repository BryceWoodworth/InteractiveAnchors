 
three experiments investigated relations between buyers' wealth ability pay atp sellers' first offers
study number demonstrated positive correlation between sellers' first offers their perceptions buyer's atp well its real economic power indicated company's market value
study number sellers field experiment made higher offers potential buyers higher atp
study number examined relations between buyer's atp perception its ability obtain alternatives specific deal sellers' first offers
found positive correlation between sellers' perception buyers' atp real atp indicated market value sellers' perception buyers' availability alternatives
study number here too unit analysis was behavior individual participant
however when sellers were primed concentrate buyers' alternatives their first offers were negatively related perceived buyer's alternatives
 introduction 
every negotiation must start first offer one negotiating parties
first offers determine process outcomes negotiations affecting both counteroffers settlement prices through process anchoring adjustment
but although first offers become important research subject recent years one simple question not been fully answered how do initiators decide amount their first offer
research indicates negotiators focus various cues reference points when deciding amount their first offer
main reference points include market prices reservation prices aspiration prices own counterpart's alternatives
several cues might not readily accessible negotiators might exert some even considerable effort find identify them
other hand easily available cues counterpart's reputation prestige power status not been investigated potential determinants initial offers
one important variable counterpart's wealth ability pay atp
current article focuses variable determinant amount first offer
common sense wisdom might lead us predict positive correlation between counterpart's perceived atp first offer will presented him her
negotiators will make higher offers wealthy counterparts because they believe greater resources wealthy afford pay more
common wisdom suggests may indeed case contractor will charge more fixing your roof if you live upscale neighborhood namely you considered high atp lawyers charge higher fees richer costumers same mechanical repair will cost you more if you drive expensive car signals high atp
legal settings there widely held belief jurors tend award higher compensation deep pocket defendants
other hand though high atp involves plentiful resources also characterized attributes likely make counterpart less willing accept high offer leading negative atp effect first offers
there two main reasons opposite effect
first solid economic basis high atp negotiators enables them better search their environment consequently find better deals than one offered
second if sellers believe wealthier buyers willing pay more than possible more sellers would approach high atp buyers
taken together two reasons suggest high atp negotiators more alternatives given deal therefore their batna best alternative negotiated agreement would better than batna low atp negotiators
better batna high atp negotiators less inclined accept high offers
somewhat parallel reasoning evident legal settings
one hand jurors might biased against wealthy defendants who afford pay award them higher compensation
however deep pockets more resources fight back
case tort law deep pockets might pay out many more claims so they will tend fight harder individual lawsuit
though considering counterparts' viewpoint negotiation setting particularly their alternatives present deal often recommended negotiators information about counterpart's alternatives often unavailable
counterpart's wealth therefore its ability pay atp other hand typically more available more visible than its alternatives its batna so becomes dominant
know decision makers tend pay attention single dominant dimension attribute objects they judge
examples behavior prominence effect namely tendency focus solely most important most prominent attribute halo effect namely tendency construct global impressions basis single trait base subsequent judgments overall impressions
thus because atp more ready cue than availability alternatives context negotiation expect positive atp effect counterpart's first offers
sum article focuses straightforward question do sellers make different first offers same products services when dealing costumers different economic resources
though question simple far know not been empirically examined
article aims fill gap investigating relation between counterpart's economic wealth therefore its atp first offers negotiation
first two studies provide lab field tests prediction
