 
across many real-world domains men engage more risky behaviors than do women
examine some beliefs preferences underlie difference number participants assessed their likelihood engaging various risky activities relating four different domains gambling health recreation social reported their perceptions number probability negative outcomes number severity potential negative outcomes number enjoyment expected risky activities
women's greater perceived likelihood negative outcomes lesser expectation enjoyment partially mediated their lower propensity toward risky choices gambling recreation health domains
perceptions severity potential outcomes was partial mediator gambling health domains
genders did not differ their propensity towards taking social risks
fifth domain activities associated high potential payoffs fixed minor costs was also assessed
contrast other domains women reported being more likely engage behaviors domain
gender difference was partially mediated women's more optimistic judgments probability good outcomes outcomes being more intensely positive
 introduction 
accidents very frequent cause death particularly among young adults teenagers u s center disease control cdc men more often victims accidents than women
example every number number us drivers men three times likely women involved fatal car accidents
while some well-known difference automobile death rates probably reflects differences average amount time men women spend driving seems likely another important cause males voluntarily engage risky behaviors more often than do females
example us women report usually using seat belts substantially more often than men men been shown run yellow lights more often than women
furthermore similar differences seen wide variety other forms accident statistics
male pedestrians uk involved accidents about number percent more often than female pedestrians men die much more often drowning accidental poisoning throughout western world
thus there seems little doubt men must engaging more risky behaviors across broad range domains
despite its obvious practical importance some key aspects psychological underpinnings gender differences risk taking not been examined
present article seeks shed new light underpinnings asking substantial sample college men women report various perceptions preferences related wide range risk-taking scenarios
existence gender differences propensity take risks been documented large number questionnaire experimental studies
example meta-analysis byrnes miller schafer reviewed over number papers gender differences risk perception
they concluded literature clearly indicated male participants more likely take risks than female participants p number
recent work begun examine generality cognitive underpinnings differences greater detail
one important study provides backdrop present investigation weber blais betz assessed risks men women perceived behaviors spanning five different content domains financial health safety recreational ethical social decisions
gender differences were found four five domainssocial decision-making being exceptionwith males perceiving less risk indicating greater likelihood engaging risky behaviors
similar gender differences been found domains large german sample
across studies social domain unique either no gender differences found when they found women who report greater propensity engage risky behaviors perceive overall greater benefit less risk doing so
interest authors also found great variability individual's willingness engage risk across domains suggesting risk taking not simply product some general personality trait promotes risk seeking
instead individual group differences substantially due differing perceptions risk different domains
most part previous research relied unitary subject-defined notion risk e g how risky behavior situation

number researchers examined role various affect dimensions determining overall perceptions riskiness
slovic proposes several psychological risk dimensions including dread control knowledge contribute perceived riskiness
follow-up research shown material well emotional factors also impact overall risk judgments
any global assessment perceived risk combines elements belief how likely something bad will happen
subjective valuation outcome how bad would

thus common parlance given behavior might said riskier than another behavior if former more severe potential consequences if higher risk potential negative consequences both
example leaving one's bike unattended day busy city bungie jumping could both described risky behaviors yet probabilities potential bad outcomes enormously different two cases
past research shows decomposing elements shed important light individual group differences responses risky situations
gurmankin levy baron had subjects assess badness unfortunate medical outcomes associated defined probability e g number percent chance loss big toe
different groups men vs women physicians vs non-physicians were differentially sensitive probability against severity
present article pursues similar approach explore determinants men's women's willingness engage different risky activities
note field finance where distribution potential outcomes obviously continuous risk often conceptualized variability returns offered choice
following approach some theorists found useful conceive people's generalized risk preferences terms how variability affects individual's disposition choose option
while seems quite reasonable many real world risky choice scenarios e g riding motorcycle without helmet not using sunscreen etc
would seem reasonable simplification view potential negative outcomes unitary event having probability some degree un-desirability
approach will followed here although general discussion will point out potential follow-up work would consider risks involving more than single discrete negative outcome
remarkably literature adults does not seem contain any studies seek decompose perceptions risk involved real-world risky behaviors order determine whether genders differ their evaluations likelihoods costs negative outcomes
number plausible hypotheses immediately present themselves
one hypothesis women do not evaluate probability negative outcomes differently than men they simply assume perhaps rightly perhaps not they would more emotionally upset harmed negative outcomes should occur
alternatively one may hypothesize women assess greater probability unfavorable outcomes without projecting any stronger negative reactions outcomes than do men
while studies gender effects adult risk preferenceswith exception gurmankin levy baron not addressed issue there one study within developmental literature explored question
hillier morrongiello examined gender differences perceptions involved physical risk taking children
using pictorial descriptions e g riding bicycle no helmet street interview determine how children assessed risks they found girls appraised more general risk i e judged situations more unsafe than boys
genders also differed factors contributed their overall risk judgments
boys' risk judgments were significantly predicted their ratings injury severity while girls' risk judgments were better predicted their ratings vulnerability any type injury
suggests girls may avoid risky situations any likelihood perceived injury boys may avoid risky situations only if possible perceived injuries judged being severe
noted above literature adults not examined whether genders differ their evaluations number likelihood potential negative outcomes number their appraisals severity potential outcomes
adults either both aspects risk may mediate gender differences engaging risky behaviors
third factor may also responsible gender differences propensity engage risky behaviors genders may differ their estimates enjoyment offered activity assuming negative outcomes do not take place
last possibility finds some support weber et al johnson et al number who found relative women men judged they would obtain greater benefits engaging risky behaviors all domains except social
using risk-return framework weber colleagues suggested risky decision making seen trade-off between fear risk hope expected returns
present study had two major goals
first was separately assess gender differences three kinds assessments just mentioned
put simple terms present study asks do women tend example engage dangerous recreational activities less often because they think likelihood injury greater b they think severity injury were occur would greater c because they simply do not find positive aspects activities attractive men do
addition examined whether assessments vary depending upon domain behavior compared patterns risk perception individuals' reports engaging risky behaviors past
second aim was explore important category choices popularly referred taking chance not our knowledge been examined previous studies individual differences risk decisions engage not engage behaviors offer small probability large positive reward return some small but certain cost
example trying number th caller radio station order win large sum money
type scenario will referred positive domain
one possible explanation why women engage fewer risky activities they relatively pessimistic feel themselves relatively unlucky i e prone experience least desirable possible outcome more often than would expected based overall frequencies
if so then women should also show less interest than men options offering low probability positive reward
another possibility women see low-frequency outcomes whether good bad more likely occur cases they should show greater attraction choices positive domain
