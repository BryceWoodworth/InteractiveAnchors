study number number participants performed experience-based decision tasks either alone pairs two members being exposed each others' choices outcomes
tasks involved either equiprobable gains losses frequent small gains rare large losses
results indicated both risk types social exposure increased proportion risky selection but its effect was stronger rare-loss condition
study number rare-loss task was administered number study participants target individual observing choices paired individual
results showed observing others rather than being observed led pattern increased risk taking
findings two studies indicate importance distinguishing different types risky situations shed light contradictory findings literature
 introduction 
effect social environment individual decision making important because many naturally occurring individual behaviors conducted presence others
area investigation often studied field social learning focused situations individuals opportunity learn others' experience
studies field tend address situations where actions differ their objective value but information not shared among all individuals
therefore observing others' behavior adds important information about right action follow
hardly any empirical research field focused interesting problem where main difference between alternatives their associated risk variance
another field study relevant current context study group behavior groups typically asked reach consensus
studies group behavior addressed question social influence risk taking
main finding line research groups tend hold more extreme risk attitudes than those their individual members
finding typically referred group polarization groupthink phenomenon
surprisingly little research been devoted individual risk taking decisions social context people able observe aspects each other's behavior situation refer social exposure
research conducted yielded mixed results
blank found repeated choice task exposing three individuals each others' outcomes facilitated risk taking compared choices made alone
conversely blaskovitch veach ginsburg experimental game blackjack found no effect social exposure
mixed findings also appear relevant applied studies
presence co-acting individuals was found increase risky street crossing computerized task but only adolescents not adults yet facilitated more risky crossing field studies
still mixed findings usually ignored research area often briefly discussed extension group polarization phenomenon observed consensual decisions
goal current study clarify effect social exposure two types risk taking situations involving losses
one type comprises cases gains losses equally likely
other type involves asymmetry likelihood magnitude gains losses particularly comprising typical small gains rare large losses
robust behavioral regularity experience-based decision making when expected values similar people choose according alternative produces best outcomes most time
accordingly people more likely select risky alternatives producing rare losses typical gains than those producing equiprobable gains losses phenomenon indeed widely observed
yet note same principle predicts when risky alternative produces rare losses information concerning others' behavior would increase risk taking
situation others' choice outcomes increase salience awareness differences between typical favorable outcome risky alternative typically unfavorable outcome safe alternative
instance consider laboratory decision task consisting safe alternative s producing number each trial risky alternative r producing number number out number selections  number remaining selections
task repeated payoffs contingent option chosen
if individual decided stop selecting r then he she no longer supplied additional evidence obtained outcome s number worse than r's number most time
social situation however others who take risk pick r naturally continuing transmit information decision maker thus likely increase level risk taking
results consistent hypothesis were reported studies examined effect obtaining feedback unselected choice alternatives i e foregone payoffs compared obtaining feedback selected ones only
decision tasks risky alternative producing rare negative outcomes common favorable outcomes individuals provided foregone payoffs continually presented favorable outcomes alternative
indeed foregone payoffs increase level risk taking tasks
however effect not been observed risky alternatives producing equally likely gains losses betting color roulette wheel
latter pattern explained fact when risky alternative equally likely produce gains losses then its outcomes not better most time adding foregone payoffs does not change fact
our main argument similarly effect foregone payoffs being exposed others' choices outcomes decision task would increase risk taking tasks involving rare losses
two controlled laboratory studies were conducted examine prediction
study number evaluated effect mutual exposure other people's choices decision tasks involving rare equiprobable losses
results showed while social exposure increased risk taking both decision tasks had larger effect rare loss condition
