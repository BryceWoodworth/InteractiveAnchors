 
study individual decision making lottery-choice task performed three different populations gamblers under psychological treatment number ddicts gamblers' spouses victims people who neither gamblers gamblers' spouses normals
find addicts willing take less risk than normals but difference smaller gambler's time under treatment increases
large majority victims report themselves unwilling take any risk at all
however addicts first year treatment react more than other addicts different values risk-return parameter
 introduction 
since late number s individual decision making under risk been one most popular issues studied economists psychologists
one hand theoretical analysis initially undertaken mostly economists framed basic problem generic situation individuals choose number probability-outcome pairs
other hand empirical contributions both disciplines adopted variety methodologies
include questionnaires economic experiments real-world data
most salient intriguing result across all different methodologies decisions risky environment very sensitive framing choice task some individual characteristics
paper focus effects problem gambling individual choice under uncertainty natural field studying interaction between subjects' characteristics their observed decision making behavior
since pathological gambling been included diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders published american psychiatric association number
patients spectrum-related disorders show intense desire perform specific behavior preceded unpleasant feelings physiological activation all relieved when behavior performed
thus several authors consider pathological gambling pg obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder
contrary view other authors argue gambling essentially egosyntonic patients all phases disorder contrast what happens obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders where behavior consistently egodystonic
moreover compulsive behaviors include increased evasive behavior anticipatory anxiety risk aversion not usually observed behavior pathological gamblers pgs
lack agreement among experts whether gambling egosyntonic egodystonic disorder could even imply gamblers may heterogeneous respect their attitudes towards their addiction
therefore at first stage whether gambling egosyntonic egodystonic disorder would influence way pgs feel about their condition
at second stage could interfere degree they feel more attracted than normal subjects bets involving riskier options
therefore studying whether pgs behave differently normal subjects risky decision-making tasks would require isolating first level pleasure discomfort due being gambler second level pleasure due betting riskier options
natural way obtaining more homogeneous population gamblers respect their attitude towards their addiction isolating studying population egodystonic gamblers those who voluntarily decided quit participate gambler anonymous ga therapy group
several aspects pgs' behavior been studied so far
studies either aimed at shedding light specific methodological issues should accounted when studying decision making pgs directly addressing question whether pgs suffer form some kind cognitive bias
among different kinds cognitive bias most obvious suspect probability distortion due attraction risky bets could yield irrational behavior reflected higher degrees risk taking compared normal subjects
along line studies toneatto gaboury ladouceur especially leopard while goodie adopts slightly different approach higher levels risk taking showing they result overconfidence
paper study risky decisions made subjects whose lives been directly affected pathological gambling decided quit participating therapy group ga
furthermore study risk taking behavior people who indirectly affected pathological gambling because they married pathological gambler
want know whether decisions aforementioned groups lottery-choice task significantly differ those taken normal subjects if so what way
order address question number subjects played hypothetical version lottery-choice task introduced sabater georgantz number s further developed discussed georgantz number s et al
task designed capture two dimensions decision making under risk
first used distinguish between risk-averse risk-neutral risk-loving subjects
also measures individual's degree risk aversion
second task captures subject's reaction different risk premia
our sample consists three different subsamples
first labeled addicts consists number pgs attending gambler anonymous ga session at annual meeting cordobesian association patholical gamblers acojer
second subsample labeled victims consists number spouses subjects first subsample
third subsample consists number subjects our control population labeled normals
sabater georgantz number s georgantz number s et al provide us much larger data set obtained normal student-subjects faced same task under different payment methods
however given age difference between students our two focus groups created new sample normal subjects sake comparability
our results show addicts exhibit higher degree risk aversion than normal individuals although their behavior tends convergence towards normals' decision making behavior time under treatment increases
interestingly victims even more risk-averse
fact large percentage them around number percent refused take any risk at all
second salient result addicts first year treatment appear more sensitive risk-rewarding increases expected rewards than all other subjects
