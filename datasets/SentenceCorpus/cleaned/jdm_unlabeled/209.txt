 
many judgment analysis studies employ multiple regression procedures estimate importance cues
some studies test significance regression coefficients order decide whether not specific cues attended judge decision maker
practice dubious because ignores type ii error
purposes note number draw attention issue specifically appears studies self-insight number illustrate problem examples judgment literature number provide simple method calculating post-hoc power regression analyses order facilitate reporting type ii errors when regression models used
 introduction 
decades judgment analysts successfully used multiple regression model organizing cognitive principles underlying many types judgments variety contexts
most often models depict individual judge decision maker combining multiple differentially weighted pieces information cues compensatory manner arrive at judgment
further analyses portray those who acquired expertise judgment task applying their judgment model policy regular although less than perfect consistency
ability linear regression models accurately reproduce expert judgments under various conditions been discussed detail
if one accepts proposition people's judgments modeled though they multiple regression equations questions arise number how many available cues does individual use
number how should number cues used determined
too many researchers blindly apply statistical significance tests inform themin kind deterministic mannerwhether judges did did not attend specific cues
if t-test calculated cue's weight significant then cue counted being attended judge
relying p values way problem because values affected number cues number cases presented judge during task how well overall regression equation fits total set responses
issue discussed note organized follows first examples judgment literature reviewed illustrate existence problem
second notation commonly used judgment analysts when describing regression procedures introduced
third using notation method calculating post-hoc power t-tests regression coefficients based noncentral t distribution described
fourth method applied estimate number cases necessary statistical significance order illustrate how investigator's conclusions about number cues attended judgment task should informed considerations type ii error
finally spss program performing calculations described provided appendix
