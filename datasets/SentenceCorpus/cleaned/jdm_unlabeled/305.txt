 
fiedler et al reviewed evidence utilization contingency inference strategy termed pseudocontingencies pcs
pcs more frequent levels implication less frequent levels assumed associated
pcs been obtained using wide range task settings dependent measures
yet readiness decision makers rely pcs poorly understood
computer simulation explored two potential sources subjective validity pcs
first pcs shown perform above chance level when task infer sign moderate strong population contingencies sample observations
second contingency inferences based pcs inferences based cell frequencies shown partially agree across samples
intriguingly criterion convergent validity by-products random sampling error highlighting inductive nature contingency inferences
 introduction 
accurate contingency assessment prerequisite explain past control present predict future
adaptive cognition perspective assessing contingencies amounts inferring relationship between two variables population sample observations drawn population
if task was evaluate relation between drinking one two beverages say red wine beer developing migraine not contingency may inferred recalling instances wine beer consumption followed not followed migraine
epistemologically then contingency sample more precisely specific contingency index used decision maker used proxy contingency general population instances
example degree last number instances alcohol consumption proportion developing migraine was higher after red wine than after beer one might conclude general red wine more conductive migraine than beer
not only x number p index example but most contingency indices inference seems unproblematic sign size sample value unbiased estimates population value
what might more problematic quality grade information required
virtually all traditional contingency indices require information about joint occurrences
other words every instance sample necessary know levels both variables
example every consumption instance one needs sure whether red wine beer had been consumed whether was followed migraine not
however due several factors e g delay between observing variables large amount variables considered information about joint occurrences might not available at time judgment preventing use common contingency indices
remainder will discuss validity alternative strategy contingency inferences applicable even under impoverished conditions pseudocontingencies
pcs denote using skew greater numbers one level than other case dichotomous variables sample base rates pair variables infer contingency
obvious using base rates pcs do not require information about joint occurrences
however because base rates largely independent contingencies less obvious why pcs should used at all
while independence true descriptively at population level will show random sampling error necessarily causes population contingencies translate into skewed sample base rates
intriguingly sample base rates skewed sampling process enable pcs successfully indicate moderate strong population contingencies
another consequence strategies rely joint occurrences mostly agree pcs' predictions across samples
