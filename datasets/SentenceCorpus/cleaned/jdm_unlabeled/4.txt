 introduction 
influential two-systems framework within decision making judgement research dichotomises between processes characterised heuristic affective intuitive versus those seen more deliberative cognitive rational
following stanovich west refer supposedly separable systems system number s number system number s number respectively
kahneman declares there considerable agreement over properties systems s number include being fast automatic effortless associative difficult control modify s number include being slower serial effortful deliberately controlled relatively flexible
despite tendency associate s number non-conscious processing s number conscious processing suggest within representative formulations two-systems framework kahneman's summary his nobel prize winning work epstein's seminal paper there considerable ambiguity over how map system number system number axis notion intuitive processing onto distinction between conscious non-conscious processes
our aim paper outline ambiguity argue why clarification important describe how clarification made both theoretically empirically suggest how consideration consciousness dimension soften two-systems dichotomy
