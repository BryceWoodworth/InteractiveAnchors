 introduction 
several studies compared bidding patterns subjects different auction mechanisms
despite theoretical equivalence among various auction mechanisms bdm mechanism second-price-auction henceforth spa empirical studies suggest behavior mechanisms may diverge
auctions based bdm mechanism individuals buying asset declare their maximum buying price known willingness-to-pay wtp
if bidding price higher than drawn number individual pays drawn number buys asset
when selling asset individuals declare their minimum selling price known willingness-to-accept wta
if bidding price lower than drawn number individual receives amount drawn number sells asset
auctions based spa highest bidder buying auction wins final prize pays second highest bid
lowest bidder selling auction wins final prize pays second lowest bid
spa more competitive than bdm mechanism since each participant competes others
shogren et al suggested spa people may submit bids win sake winning
they may bid wtp-up wta-down order walk out experiment 'top-dog' among their peers p number
top-dog effect said exist if bidders submit bids excess their true valuation intention deriving utility winning auction
previous evidence existence top-dog effect been mixed
shogren hayes report nearly number percent participants induced-value auction market submitted bids were less than equal their assigned value
authors concluded results not consistent existence top-dog effect
contrast kagel's review induced-value spa literature indicates mean bid auctions generally greater than predicted theory
corrigan rousu provided evidence spa overbidding repeated trial auctions interpreting results top-dog effect
addition shavit et al show competitiveness affects bidding patterns spa
current study examines impact top-dog effect competitiveness effect spa bidding patterns different goods riskless risky assets different positions buyer seller
particular study examined wtp wta analyzing buying selling bidding patterns both mugs lotteries two separate auctions mechanism spa competitive environment bdm mechanism non-competitive environment
consider two types lotteries regular lotteries extreme lotteries
extreme lotteries involve very high outcome associated small probability low zero outcome associated high probability
previous studies did not distinguish between biddings regular extreme lotteries two mechanisms
study examine two types lotteries since expected find differences between them bidding patterns spa bdm
extreme lotteries expect no impact competitiveness effect buying position spa since chances loss very high lottery will not attractive buy
addition expect competitiveness effect selling position spa will canceled out since seller extreme lottery who focuses very high winning outcome will avoid selling
evaluate wtp wta item considered several psychological effects influence bidding patterns individuals
effects impact each effects sum all them wtp wta expected vary among goods mechanisms
literature does not discuss possible interaction between psychological effects competitiveness environment effect
our study fills void compares interaction effects bidding mugs lotteries
psychological effects loss aversion endowment effect been used explain wta-wtp disparity
yet recent studies questioned existence interpretation possible gap between wtp wta
shogren hayes shogern et al argued wta-wtp disparity first trial market goods candy bars university mugs both auctions bdm spa disappeared quickly repeated trials spa though persisted bdm mechanism
shogern et al suggested wta-wtp disparity may depend auction mechanism
lotteries schmidt traub argued asymmetric effect buyer focuses potential disappointment lowest outcome seller focuses potential regret losing highest outcome may cause disparity between wta wtp
current study use not only mugs but also regular extreme lotteries enable us examine more rigorously asymmetry between buyers sellers
sum current study examines wta wtp riskless goods mugs two types risky assets regular extreme lotteries competitive versus non-competitive mechanisms compares wta-wtp gap items two mechanisms
study also discusses influence interaction between competitive effect other psychological effects subjects' bidding patterns
results should shed some light impact competitiveness effect spa bidding pattern different assets different positions comparison bdm
