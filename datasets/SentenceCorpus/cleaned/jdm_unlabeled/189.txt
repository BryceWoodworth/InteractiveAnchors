 
ninety-eight australian students participated functional replication study published dijksterhuis et al
results indicated unconscious thought does not necessarily lead better normative decision making performance than conscious thought contrary results found dijksterhuis et al since other studies showed positive though statistically not significant effect unconscious thought meta-analysis comprising total number experiments was conducted
suggests there little evidence advantage normative decision making using unconscious thought
however discussion potential moderators shows further study would help identify situations unconscious thought truly helpful those not
 introduction 
series studies dijksterhuis colleagues established surprising counterintuitive finding unconscious thought leads better decision making performance complex problems than conscious thought
unconscious thought defined cognitive affective task-relevant processes take place outside conscious awareness
second postulate reverse true simple decision consciously thinking about them better
paper concerned only first
common denominator all experiments described dijksterhuis colleagues experimental technique
participants split two three groups provided number pieces information about number options choose instance four apartments flatmates
each option described same number attributes usually attributes choice option
example attribute all choice options apartments might size
typically attributes conceptualized dichotomously  either apartment spacious not
all pieces information about all choice options presented either lists e g newell wong cheung rakow press individually randomized e g study individually fixed order fixed amount time
prior information presentation participants informed they will choose one options b rate each option e g lerouge submitted
then following presentation information participants either immediately make choice between options think about their choice fixed amount time distracted same amount time before making their decision
principal claim when number factors ought considered high indicated number attributes decision therefore complex unconscious thought will lead better decision performance than conscious deliberation
better decision making i call normative here defined choosing ranking higher options more positive features
however although most dijksterhuis colleagues' experiments found effect hypothesized direction effects often failed reach statistical significance when comparing unconscious conscious group directly
example first reported experiment dijksterhuis' number study critical comparison did not reach statistical significance p less than number
context important point out sequence experiments carried out dijksterhuis only first two published were exclusively directed at establishing differences between decision success under unconscious versus conscious thought
other experiments primarily investigated further aspects what was become theory unconscious thought
example experiments number number dijksterhuis bos nordgren van baaren's study dealt deliberation without attention effect required two conditions complex simple one were differentiated number information bits participants received
however even though studies did not primarily contrast conscious unconscious thought they frequently provided data supporting notion unconscious thought superior form integrating large amount information
conscious thought according dijksterhuis very useful monitoring information respect particular criterion example minimal amount space must available apartment
engage logical operations work quantities precise fashion case mathematical operations
other hand limited capacity thus unsuitable integrate large amounts information
unconscious thought other hand claimed possess virtually infinite processing capacity process information divergently employ natural weighing mechanism acquired information
alleged differences between two forms thought been described six principles some additional characteristics dijksterhuis nordgren who re-stated basic tenet unconscious thought works well complex decision situations multiple sources relevant information
despite its empirical successes its advanced conceptual development theory unconscious thought not been without criticism
shanks number example claimed unconscious thought effects were artefact differential rates forgetting rather than product different forms processing
theory was also criticised limited sample size supporting studies concern was voiced about applicability theory clinical context dijksterhuis colleagues pointed out theory was not intended
addition criticisms currently published data fairly limited they almost exclusively include studies one laboratory
purpose present article two-fold
first aim provide replication data unconscious decision making effect english-speaking sample english stimulus material
study was also designed gather additional information rule out potential alternative explanations unconscious thought effect
