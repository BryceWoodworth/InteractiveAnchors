 
propose constructed-choice model general decision making
model departs utility theory prospect theory its treatment multiple goals suggests several different ways context affect choice
particularly instructive apply model protective decisions often puzzling
among other anomalies people insure against non-catastrophic events underinsure against catastrophic risks allow extraneous factors influence insurance purchases other protective decisions
neither expected-utility theory nor prospect theory explain anomalies satisfactorily
apply model above anomalies consider many different insurance-related goals organized taxonomy consider effects context goals resources plans decision rules
paper concludes suggesting some prescriptions improving individual decision making respect protective measures
 introduction 
concept goal aim motive purpose etc
been long been taken granted many accounts human behavior
behavior attributed aims goals everyday discourse he wore his best suit order make good first impression literature epics novels etc
scientific discourse example widely differing accounts aristotle's ethics circa number b c e
william james's principles psychology kurt lewin's dynamic theory personality
despite obviousness wide use goal concepts dominant tradition economics decision sciences emphasized utility value basis choice
particular goals viewed ways increasing utility happiness
utility thought sort common currency integrates multiple goals multiple quantitative attributes outcomes
standpoint tradeoffs among goals attempts maximize utility
view all goals contribute single common currency was clearly enunciated plato symposium
he used metaphor weighing different pleasures pains balance
view central plato's thought underlying his theories education government
studies mathematics science metaphysics needed educate skillful weigher who must integrate across different goals across near distant times
similar views dominated utilitarian thought number th number th centuries included integration value across individuals society well different goals times e g
bentham number
aristotle's ethics contrast partially disagreed emphasizing multiple goods stating way different goals fit together should vary occasion
aristotle perhaps read advocating situation-dependent integration multiple goals idea pursue elaborate paper
despite hint aristotle plato's concept single common currency serves integrate value across myriad goals largely held sway both general psychology decision science
freud's concept libido beebe-center's hedonic tone hull's concept generalized drive work reward systems brain diener's seligman's concepts general happiness all suggest some general quality linked many different goals
exception keeney who advocates decision analysis focus separate goals values starting point rather than goal tradeoffs represented overall utility
decision science concept maximization linked closely mapping onto single dimension utility
bounded set real numbers limiting maximum but there no natural total ordering sets vectors two more dimensions therefore no natural concept maximization
fact total ordering fundamental most foundational theories decision science
idea all human goods weighed same balance fascinating scientific hypothesis been worth pursuing determine extent its applicability ways fails
translating many goods into one-dimensional currency fits well human thought processes especially analog mental models
unidimensionality opens way application powerful mathematical methods computing approximating maxima
paper pursue more aristotelian theory decision making where preferences constructed based decision context decision maker focuses goals rather than maximizing happiness utility
attempt show alternative approach leads new explanations how people make choices raises novel questions respect descriptive theories behavior prescriptive guidelines aiding decision maker improving choices
our title implies theory present about goals plans
many plansgoing out movie embarking shopping trip purchasing insurance invasion iraq united statesare were selected view achieving several different goals at once
shopping trip paradigmatic because often involves several discrete stops each one more goals but evening at movie may simultaneously satisfy goals companionship emotional visual stimulation keeping up current culture
insurance plans often aimed both at financial goals at emotional goals peace mind
will discuss multiple goals insurance other protective plans detail below
accord miller galanter pribram regard plan fundamental structural unit decision theory
do not consider each tiny muscle movement each phoneme utterance choice
rather decision theory offers explanations only at behavioral level where someone consciously unconsciously considers what goals will accomplished various possible plans what plan designed will likely achieve several important goals
past research plans unearthed various areas cognitive science
area motor control particularly rich evidence unconscious higher-level programs governing sequences skilled movements
interest movement planning very explicit robotics
planning sporadically been considered other theories human artificial intelligence
one major virtues considering goals plans together individual decision making brought into close analogy organizational decision making
latter goals plans shared among individuals groups select implement plans
new railroad bridge advertising campaign goals plans their perceived relationship made explicit often recorded
individual decision goals plans their perceived relationship hidden within person's conscious unconscious cognitions emotions but one try nonetheless gather data provide some information about processes
stance also requires us distinguish between goals resources
plans draw resources achieve goals
some resources money favors owed accumulated sometimes accumulation resource may itself become goal
nonetheless continue distinguish example between money considered resource same money considered goal
main concern our paper protective decision making
much focus even narrower consider insurance decisions at length
theory offer much more broadly applicable
however found narrower focus useful theory development
there many apparent anomalies insurance decisions individuals households
classical utility theory supposed account decision making under risk especially insurance purchase
was not obvious us initially goal plan approach would do better than utility theory its popular alternative prospect theory
applying multiple-goal theory domain been both challenging enlightening compared more obvious examples shopping trips movie excursions
discussing insurance choices start idea insurance designed principally device share financial risk situations where many at risk but relatively few actually suffer financial loss
many cases easy share financial risk but difficult if not impossible share other risks
having one's home burn down example extremely stressful even if nobody hurt
stress may persist considerable period time
stress-induced suffering cannot readily shared others not directly affected fire although social practices exist ease
what most easily shared financial risk
each household at risk pays relatively small amount insurance premium participate risk sharing
when participant's home does burn down insurer pays contracted amount cover some cost rebuilding purchasing replacement home
instead few cases where victims suffer catastrophic financial loss everyone at risk bears much smaller financial payment
insurance premiums must large enough aggregate cover not only total insured financial losses but also costs insurer risk-sharing effort
thus premiums unless subsidized usually exceed average losses
common-sense terms standard economic theory people willing pay more than expected loss because they risk-averse
paying premium does not lower overall utility happiness level significantly but suffering large financial loss would result very large drop utility happiness
ratio utility changes much greater than inverse probability incurring loss thus suggesting individuals purchase insurance so maximize their expected utility
financial standpoint anomalies arise when consumer choices respect insurance sometimes appear suboptimal given reasonable degrees risk aversion
example common people pay added premiums seem excessive obtain automobile collision insurance low rather than high deductible requires them pay initial portion loss
make matters worse some decide not file claim following small accident whose cost could largely reimbursed via low deductible they fear claim would lead increased premiums next succeeding years they prefer avoid incurring transaction costs involved settling claim their insurer
higher deductible would saved individuals money before accident avoided costs associated deciding whether not file claim
rather different example emerged after passage national flood insurance program nfip number
insurance coverage against water damage flooding was offered both homeowners commercial enterprises high hazard areas at subsidized low rates
yet there was limited interest purchasing coverage despite subsidy despite potential catastrophic losses
third example many people prepared pay considerably more insure possessions they find very attractive than insure possessions toward they feel neutral negative
if possession needed then must replaced after loss damage
replacement cost remains same independent one's positive negative feelings toward object
since insurance offers exactly claims payment hard justify financially paying more insuring attractive than less attractive object
remainder paper organized following manner
next section number discuss types insurance anomaly illustrated preceding three examples suggest psychological processes related goals might account each type
section number presents elements quantitative theory constructed choice based goals plans decision weights contrasts theory standard theory expected utility maximization
section number presents taxonomy insurance-related goals
section number draws taxonomy explain insurance anomalies terms our constructed-choice theory
section also probes failings utility theory prospect theory respect characterizing insurance decisions
paper concludes section number set prescriptive implications concerning protective activities based our theory decision making
