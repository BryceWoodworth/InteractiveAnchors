 
dynamic connectionist models decision making decision field theory propose effect context choice arises series pairwise comparisons between attributes alternatives across time
they predict limiting amount time make decision should decrease rather than increase size contextual effects
prediction was tested across four levels time pressure both asymmetric dominance compromise decoy effects choice
overall results supported prediction both types decoy effects found larger time pressure decreased
 introduction 
wide body research demonstrated contextual sensitivity preference showing preferences some degree depend upon set inferior alternatives considered at time choice
decoy effects asymmetric dominance ad compromise effects c common examples sensitivity
particular decoy effects examples preference reversals situations preference ordering between two alternatives changes changes context
although much research focused demonstrating explaining decoy effects little work been done explore effect time pressure effect decoy
