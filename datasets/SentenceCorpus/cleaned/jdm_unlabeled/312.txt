 introduction 
when immediate temptations conflict long-term aspirations immediate temptations often prevail important goals remain unfulfilled
failures self-control well documented behavioral domains diverse dieting smoking interpersonal conflict
ability forego small immediate rewards order receive larger future rewards viewed hallmark effective self-control both humans animals
report examine impact information about foregone fictive outcomes human decision-making behavior situations short long-term rewards conflict
forgone outcomes counterfactual rewards could been obtained had one made alternate choices
our task captures aspects real-world tasks people face repeated choices outcomes determined past choices well current choices
classic study self-control children mischel shoda rodriguez found preschoolers' ability forego immediate gratification e g one cookie immediately order attain more valuable eventual outcomes e g two cookies after brief delay predictive number key competencies adolescence
several studies suggest most effective strategy delaying gratification directing one's attention away reward-related stimuli during waiting period
specifically children who direct their attention away smaller immediate reward better able forego short-term gains allowing them maximize long-term gains
hot cool systems framework one popular theory performance delay gratification studies
according theory one's level self-control dictated interacting hot cool systems
hot system fast emotionally driven automatically triggered reward-related stimuli
contrast cool system slow reflective top-down-goal-driven
interplay between two systems either undermine support one's efforts delay gratification
external e g whether immediate reward visible internal factors e g whether one's attention focused immediate reward accentuate immediate rewards activate hot system
immediate rewards become more salient one becomes more likely succumb control hot system lead failure delay gratification
one criticism previous self-control studies they involve explicit tradeoffs intertemporal options do not occur real-life situations
paradigms participants told explicitly when larger delayed rewards will received
real world people rarely given explicit information about long-term consequences immediate actions
example consider conflict between short long-term goals facing executive expanding firm
at each choice point executive elect continue investing new equipment training thus increasing firm's future output boosting long-term profits executive instead cut costs order boost short-term profits thus deferring future benefits new investment
executive's choices effectively influence state environment affects future returns
here precise long-term consequences executive's choices not known until future time points
long-term optimal choice must some extent learned experientially through interactive exploration decision space our example corresponds observing increasing returns resulting continued investment equipment training
present work examines optimal long-term choice behavior dynamic task recurring choices providing more realistic representation many short long-term tradeoffs daily life
whereas explicit tradeoff paradigm treats choices static one-shot decisions many real-world decisions often informed past outcomes one's current situation determined past choices
notably experimental paradigm proposed herrnstein colleagues affords examination individuals' ability maximize long-term rewards dynamic choice environments
consider task reward structure depicted figure number
horizontal axis represents current state decision environment whereas vertical axis represents reward selecting either choice
every state one option refer short-term option always yields higher immediate reward than other option refer long-term option
state environment defined number long-term choices made over last ten trials
making larger proportion long-term choices over time moves current state environment rightwards horizontal axis thus increasing rewards both choices
effectually choices yield larger immediate rewards negatively affect future rewards analogous cutting costs above example whereas options less immediately attractive lead larger future rewards analogous continuing investment new equipment training
dynamic choice environment maximizing long-term i e global rewards requires forgoing larger immediate i e local rewards guaranteed short-term option continually making long-term choices
growing literature examined factors bear decision-maker's ability learn reward-maximizing choice strategy similar environments
report consider dynamic decision making tasks people learn about rewards resulting both chosen unchosen i e foregone options
example executive may able both observe actual result further investment calculate hypothetical cost savings would resulted suspending investment
although neural substrates signal representing foregone rewards distinct directly experienced rewards been identified both humans primates unclear how reward signals combine shape behavior
behavioral research human decision making yielded some insight into how knowledge foregone rewards affect choice behavior
settings where rewards change over time foregone rewards support optimal choice when chasing foregone rewards advantageous likewise hinder optimal choice when chasing foregone rewards disadvantageous
further sensitivity foregone rewards appears diminish over time repeated-choice settings
present work extends research dynamic decision-making environments
unlike static tasks been used examine effects foregone rewards information rewards performing actions dynamic tasks contingent upon past choice behavior
namely rewards present trial determined one's recent history choices
consider particular form sequential dependency short long-term rewards conflict
task strategy maximizing long-term rewards not obvious decision-maker at outset
thus computational challenge arises  described greater detail below  crediting past decisions indirectly led better worse rewards present
hypothesize when short long-term rewards conflict foregone rewards accentuate local superiority short-term option e g cutting costs consequently bias choice away long-term option e g investment equipment training
our predictions dynamic decision tasks consistent findings delay-of-gratification studies find focusing attention away short-term reward increases likelihood exercising self-control gain delayed but larger reward
investigate possibility manipulate information presented about foregone rewards after each choice laboratory task outlined above see figure number
example after long-term choice participant might shown number points were actually earned well number points could been earned had participant made short-term choice
our hypothesis forgone information will accentuate short-term option's larger immediate payoff discourage exploration decision space leading behavior suboptimal long run
foreshadow our results find inclusion more information i e about forgone payoffs makes less likely decision-maker will maximize long-term returns
result surprising surface anticipated standard reinforcement learning mechanism single information-processing stream opposed separate hot cool systems
according hot cool systems view accentuating greater immediate rewards associated short-term option should increase hot system's control over choice leading consistent selection globally inferior short-term option
rl mechanism explains result without recourse two systems different computational properties
rl models learn their interactions environment maximize gains making use reward signal provides information about goodness actions
framework been used model human decision-making behavior well firing patterns dopaminergic neurons primates
our rl model demonstrates weighting fictive i e forgone reward signal action not taken impedes exploration decision space because tasks where short long-term rewards conflict adequate exploration necessary reach optimal choice strategy
absence specialized hot cool components associative account provides simple account choice behavior related tasks
rule out effect foregone rewards does not arise confusion stemming additional information but rather arises highlighting local superiority short-term option include additional condition specious foregone rewards provided
sought manipulation would demonstrate foregone reward information systematically biases choice does not merely overload participants information hindering optimal choice behavior
demonstrate employ control condition termed false foregone rewards false-fr
condition when short-term option chosen foregone rewards long-term option appear greater than experienced rewards order promote belief long-term option locally superior
likewise when long-term option chosen foregone rewards short-term option appear smaller than experienced reward order promote belief short-term option locally inferior
link real-world example manipulation akin college student telling friend who spent night studying at library party they had foregone was actually fun was boring
short actual feedback chosen option veridical but information about forgone option favors long-term option locally
if additional information about forgone rewards does not confuse participants should find participants provided specious information about forgone rewards should make more optimal choices than participants not provided foregone rewards
other words predict more less when local information emphasizes short-term gains but more more when local information emphasizes long-term gains
