 introduction 
drift diffusion model ddm one cornerstones modern psychology increasingly behavioral neuroscience
model received increased attention over last years several reasons
first provided more accurate descriptions accuracy reaction time data than alternative models wide range psychological tasks including perceptual discrimination go-no-go tasks
second model special case many its competitors sign its generality
finally model been applied explain neurophysiological data various perceptual discrimination tasks compelling neuronal interpretation
important open problem behavioral neuroscience how brain compares values make simple choices
problem particularly interesting because there ample evidence suggesting comparison process not deterministic does not always choose best option
success ddm realm perceptual decision making lead several groups neuroeconomics speculate same computational model might used brain make simple value based choices
type choice refers situations brain chooses among several possible stimuli associated different reward values at consumption e g alternative food items assigning value every item under consideration comparing values select one them
paper investigates extent ddm explain accuracy reaction time data real simple food choices
subjects made real choices between pairs appetitive snack foods had eat food they chose randomly selected trial
task conceptually similar previous experiments perceptual discrimination human subjects had decide two stimuli was brightest
key difference our experiment our subjects made choices between stimuli associated different levels reward at consumption instance value-based choice
interesting ask whether both types tasks described same computational model because given large degree specialization brain there no priori reason same algorithms would used perceptual reward domains
compare four different versions ddm vary number free parameters they contain whether barriers constant decrease time speed up decision making
since best fitting model likely depend speed decisions made carry out separate model fitting comparisons two different time pressure experimental conditions allow us identify aspects ddm responsible any changes performance
found popular seven-parameter version ratcliff ddm model account data high-accuracy both high low time pressure conditions
furthermore also found changes associated introduction time pressure could traced changes two key model parameters barrier height noise slope drift process
understanding conditions under ddm explain behavioral data simple value based choice important several reasons
first necessary first step exploring extent model account underlying neural computations
second since ddm been shown provide accurate description data other domains finding ddm also provides good computational description value-based choices provides insight into nature some basic algorithms might at work many different psychological processes
best our knowledge performance ddm not been tested before realm value-based choice although been extensively tested other realms
fact best our knowledge provided accurate quantitative characterization key aspects data every domain been applied
example ddm been tested human non-human primates using newsome-shadlen random dot motion perceptual discrimination task
few studies explored ability models related ddm explain various common choice patterns
example several studies explored ability decision field theory variant ddm account patterns choice multi-attribute settings choices among lotteries but not provided full experimental test against data
other studies investigated ability competing accumulator model accomplish similar goals
although previous studies shown relatively simple computational models decision-making account some stylized facts behavioral literature their full properties realm simple value based choice not been investigated
