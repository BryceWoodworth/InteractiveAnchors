 
paper uses proprietary data blackjack table las vegas analyze how expectation regret affects peoples' decisions during gambles
even among group people who choose participate risk-taking activity find strong evidence economically significant omission bias number percent mistakes at table caused playing too conservatively resulting substantial monetary losses
behavior equally prevalent among large-stakes gamblers does not change face more complicated strategic decisions
 introduction 
much modern economics built premise people maximize their expected utility wealth when making decisions under uncertainty
contrast psychologists argue people often act not so much maximize their expected utility but instead minimize their expected regret  people make choices minimize their expected feeling remorse when action turns out badly compared other alternatives
some decision environments lead people suboptimally favor inaction over action inducing what known omission bias
inaction plays salient role wide range decisions
example people reticent vaccinate children potentially lethal vaccine even when risk pales comparison incidence death caused primary disease
staggering number us households fail rebalance their stock portfolios when optimal do so
many us workers under-participate their retirement plans despite presence employer-matching programs
shoppers often reluctant make purchases when discounts randomly offered market
calibrating impact expected regret omission bias challenging outside experimental setting because requires parameterizing complex set beliefs controlling risk aversion
paper study expected regret omission bias analyzing actual play at blackjack table las vegas
blackjack two important features make attractive purpose
first setting aside issue card counting easy categorize optimal play every conceivable situation document departures optimal play unambiguous way
because there well-publicized solution game known basic strategy been widely accessible card players since number s
indeed many card playing guides offer steps learning basic strategy
second more importantly blackjack players place bets game before they make strategic decisions
therefore all but few situations bet essentially sunk cost once play begins optimal strategy independent player's level risk aversion
fact allows us identify role regret avoidance inaction independent risk aversion
data consist over number number hands played over number number rounds actual play las vegas casino
data our study were obtained pilot study bally mp number card chip recognition system originally designed mindplay intelligent games
mp number system optically based tracks all bets choices during play capturing data covert non-intrusive way
allows us record essential features game manner leaves natural play game unaltered
using novel data source find strong evidence omission bias present ex ante choices card players make
when blackjack players make mistakes they four times more likely make error failing act than they make error taking unnecessary i e suboptimal action
relevant null hypothesis zero omission bias would errors commission omission occurring proportion how often players were optimally required stand take card under basic strategy
even if focus areas strategy space heavily favor action optimal strategy leading high number passive mistakes under null reject null zero omission bias high degree confidence
economic magnitude omission bias large
aggregate players single-hand deals who followed basic strategy won number number percent time very close theoretical win rate reported blackjack guides
deviators won only number number percent time statistically significantly lower
total about number number changed hands during pilot study
players followed basic strategy won total over number number while they lost only about number number following basic strategy
contrast only number number was won over number number lost hands deviated basic strategy
passive mistakes lost over number every dollar won while aggressive mistakes lost only about number number every dollar won
therefore passive mistakes not only more common they more costly
consider alternative explanations other than omission bias choices observe
first explanation card counters responsible deviations basic strategy
explore possibility systematically examine deviations basic strategy find no evidence deviations vary count manner prescribed card counting strategies
should also note probably unlikely explanation since win rates among basic strategy deviators so low economic losses so high
second limited cognitive ability driving our results
indeed may some players find difficult remember optimal choice all situations
control account strategic difficulty certain situations e g playing hands soft versus hard totals
idea here if cognitive limitations make omission bias more prevalent then should more pronounced among more difficult hands
find though omission bias not more pronounced among hands higher order thinking required
third possible explanation players derive utility continued play thus reluctant take additional card if doing so might exclude them participating rest round
test possibility account position player at table number players seated at table
at large tables find no evidence passive mistakes cluster disproportionately more among those who high seat order at table
admittedly does not completely rule out consideration staying live hand however staying live does represent another source expected regret
indeed if people were willing sacrifice expected winnings because they would feel remorse if they did not continue game when they busted would further support our argument expected regret impacts strategic decisions
analysis paper replicates extends work keren wagenaar who used game blackjack laboratory understanding player's attitudes about game
they observed complete history play number subjects amsterdam casino conducted personal interviews many players learn their self-perceptions how they make decisions
while they collected rich data set provided many insights our analysis distinct focus omission bias alternative explanations result
casino indeed opportune place study other aspects human behavior decision making
sundali croson studied hot hand bias gambler's fallacy analyzing videotapes individuals who play roulette casino reno nevada
public entertainment also been convenient venue study though many instances difficult disentangle regret avoidance risk aversion cognitive limitations
example tenorio cason derive subgame perfect nash equilibrium game segment television show price right document systematic deviations optimal strategy
deviations indeed consistent omission bias risk aversion cognitive limitations but determining one responsible observed behavior generally difficult
rest paper organized follows
