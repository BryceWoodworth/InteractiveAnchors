 
using stochastic dominance approach international dataset about number number catholic subjects show incentives based absolute belief play crucial role religious practice church attendance prayer
furthermore find when both positive heaven negative hell incentives available former much stronger effect than latter
results confirmed using kolmogorov-smirnov tests
 introduction 
many studies examined role incentives their effect behavior individuals
study interest falls effect incentives religious behavior sense they increase decrease individual religious performance
religious practice encouraged two types incentives earthly ones afterlife ones
paper addresses second group
previous studies analyzed effects afterlife incentives religious behavior
azzi ehrenberg were first propose test theoretical model afterlife religious capital
they analyzed determinants participation religious activities using utility-maximizing model
among other results they found afterlife beliefs major determinant church attendance
using several surveys carried out united states they provided empirical support their theory
blomberg et al developed model where financial religious contributions motivated both current consumption afterlife considerations
they show afterlife considerations play important role explaining financial religious contributions
pyne studied relationship between religiosity fear death
he found individuals who place higher probability existence afterlife invest more religious capital
recently bra xf number as-garza et al estimated role afterlife beliefs production religious commodities concretely church attendance prayer
using ordered logit regressions they found afterlife beliefs crucial determinants but more importantly beliefs heaven much more relevant than beliefs hell positive incentives stronger than negative ones
however regression approach does not allow us study joint effect positive negative incentives
when logit model contains interactions among variables two problems appear i computation partial effects becomes problematic ii interpretation estimate effects not straightforward
showed norton et al estimated coefficients interaction terms do not reflect interaction effect moreover their statistical significance cannot tested through simple t-test
even more problematic interpretation given estimated interaction effect also conditional current value other independent variables
hence cannot properly study meaning different interactions logit regression model
paper presents different statistical tool  stochastic dominance approach  allows use straightforward interpretation joint effect positive negative incentives
our analyses confirm main results showed bra xf number as-garza et al revises interactive effects among positive negative incentives
easy graphical way show afterlife incentives play crucial role religious performance comparing not only positive negative incentives but combination both compared
study was carried out catholic people
catholic religion church attendance prayer strategies lead heaven prevent hell
church attendance prayer two dimensions religiosity reflect public religious activities versus private intimate prayer activities
while church attendance also non-religious motives networking building social ties private prayer activity more pure religious motives
using stochastic dominance approach ask whether absolute beliefs eternal bliss heaven eternal damnation hell increase individual's religious investment reflected church attendance prayer whether absolute belief eternal damnation hell more less powerful incentive than eternal bliss heaven intensified religious effort
