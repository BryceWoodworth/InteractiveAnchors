studied how people's chronic orientation cope failing projects i e action vs state orientation influences occurrence sunk cost effect
found people state orientation who tendency ruminate about past events hard time let go them were especially prone fall sunk cost trap
people action orientation who more easily let go past events were not susceptible sunk cost effect
discuss implications results sunk cost fallacy literature
 introduction 
makes no sense eat dessert you dislike pay stock broker knowing money will lost right
yet many people do exactly they make investments will vain prevent wasting earlier investments
having paid dessert people thus feel they should finish even though dessert not their liking would waste pay not eat
similar vein people may reluctant sell their losing stocks because selling they would acknowledge their prior investments were wasted
tendency honor prior costs holding failing projects called sunk cost fallacy
more general terms sunk cost fallacy describes tendency continue endeavour once investment money effort time been made
people regularly use sunk costs justify further investments many decisions ranging decision eat dessert one already paid decision continue research development already outperformed products
effect not restricted consumer behavior economic decision making but extends many other decisions including policy making
instance one important reasons continue war iraq was prevent acknowledging soldiers who fell battle died vain
sunk cost fallacy thus influences many decisions very mundane highly exceptional affects all sorts people ranging customers restaurants most important influential leaders
above clear people likely become victims sunk cost fallacy
however one could wonder whether all people equally likely fall prey effect
some people seem dwell more past than others
differences coping been demonstrated extensive research state versus action orientation
action-oriented people typically get over negative events quickly focus taking action solve them while state-oriented people typically find difficult overcome negative event keep ruminating about how affects their current state
distinction seems highly relevant question whether people differ their susceptibility sunk cost fallacy
although prior investments like paying dessert buying stocks may not seen negative events they may become negative if they not compensated current future outcomes i e if dessert tastes horrible stocks lose their value
question then becomes how state action-oriented people respond those prospects how much they let their decisions affected prior investments
our proposition state-oriented people more affected prior investments
argue more state-oriented people more prone they see current decisions light previous investments thereby strengthening association between two events
more action-oriented people more likely they focus future what they achieve thereby weakening association between current decisions previous investments
indirect support reasoning comes research showing more action-oriented people more they decouple missed opportunities past related decisions they currently face
respect sunk cost fallacy expect compared action-oriented people state-oriented people more influenced previous investments when deciding about current investment hence they more likely show sunk cost fallacy
predictions particularly interesting relation prior reasoning action orientation literature
there assumption often made action-oriented mindset increases likelihood finishing project
moreover argued against nature action-oriented people quit already started project
at first sight present hypothesis seems at odds reasoning predicts precisely opposite
however argue line earlier studies sense action-oriented people expected more decisive than state-oriented people they urge take action solve failing situation
thus case sunk costs applying reasoning leads counterintuitive prediction more action-oriented people more likely they quit project they started investing
put differently expect state-oriented people more likely continue investing than action-oriented people
order examine presented participants standard sunk cost decision scenario presence absence sunk cost was manipulated
related participants' answers their scores chronic action orientation measure was assessed at earlier occasion
expected find stronger sunk cost effects state-oriented people than action-oriented people
