 
anchoring effects assimilation numerical estimates previously considered standards highly robust
two studies examined whether mood expertise jointly moderate magnitude anchoring
previous research demonstrated happy mood induces judges process information less thorough manner than sad mood means happy judges tend more susceptible unwanted influences
however may not true anchoring effects
because anchoring results elaborate process selective knowledge activation more thorough processing should lead more anchoring result sad judges should show stronger anchoring effects than happy judges happy judges may even remain uninfluenced given anchors
because information processing experts may relatively independent their mood however mood may influence anchoring only non-experts
results two studies legal decision-making study number numeric estimates study number consistent expectations
findings suggest at least non-experts positive mood may eliminate otherwise robust anchoring effect
 introduction 
human judgment shaped affective influences
how people judge evaluate given target critically depends how they feel
judges' mood example influences how they judge their own lives other persons frequency risks
effects might occur because judges tend use their mood information judgment process
however moods influence human judgments not only because they used directly information but also because they exert more indirect influence changing how judges process information
particular judges who happy mood tend process information more superficial heuristic manner whereas those sad mood tend process information more thoroughly
example judges happy mood rely more use stereotypes other heuristic strategies than judges sad mood
extent use heuristic strategies leads judgmental biases findings suggest happy judges typically less accurate more biased than sad judges
however there appears at least one notable exception rule  judgmental anchoring
