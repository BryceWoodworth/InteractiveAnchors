hypothesize duration exposure item will foster increased pre-ownership attachment item increased valuations manner similar duration actual ownership
examine effect two experiments both variations classic mug experiment

 introduction 
ownership item been shown increase owner's valuation phenomenon termed endowment effect
most widely-held explanation endowment effect manifestation asymmetry value kahneman tversky call loss aversion based observation loss greater subjective effect than does equivalent gain
extant literature suggests endowment affects monetary valuations moment individual gains factual ownership item
reason kahneman knetsch thaler used term instant endowment effect
strahilevitz loewenstein extended notion suggesting although adaptation ownership begins immediately following endowment complete adaptation ownership likely take time
strahilevitz loewenstein suggested adaptation ownership need not all-or-nothing because individuals may not adapt instantaneously fully either acquisition loss item
series experiments they demonstrate duration ownership increases valuations items people currently own well items they owned past
however several recent studies suggested endowment effect may affect valuations even sooner i e before actual ownership takes place
example casey discovered gap between participants' compensation demanded their willingness pay lottery tickets even absence actual ownership
likewise sen johnson found merely possessing coupon product increased consumer's preference product manner similar ownership
carmon et al showed simply thinking about option created sense pre-factual ownership option increased sense loss after choosing alternative option
findings consistent earlier work dhar simonson who observed making option focus comparison enhanced its perceived attractiveness probability would selected
hoch loewenstein suggested change individual's reference point accompanies partial ownership good
they note after partially adapting possession good consumers may feel deprived if they subsequently unable fully acquire item
result hoch loewenstein suggested consumer who partially adapts ownership good may increased motivation acquire item
if conjectures true then should expect partial adaptation ownership begin immediately following initiation physical contact item intensify duration contact
article investigates effect duration exposure i e duration physical contact valuations two separate experiments makes several contributions growing literature endowment effect
related experimental work found duration auction participation operationalized terms number rounds bidder was allowed participate affect bidder's valuation auctioned item
however our work first investigate effect duration exposure item valuations where exposure operationalized amount time participants tactilely examine item before bidding
accomplish performed two variations classic mug experiment
induce different levels exposure varied amount time participants examined mugs before placing their bids
first study participants bid first-price sealed bid auctions
second study participants bid online english open bid auctions
data both studies suggest duration exposure affects valuations manner similar duration ownership examining item longer periods time resulted greater attachment item thus higher valuations
therefore show effects observed strahilevitz loewenstein's study do not appear rely factual ownership per se but were result increased subjective feeling ownership pseudo-endowment induced increased duration physical possession object
our findings also suggest subjective feelings ownership may affect valuations much more quickly than prior researchers envisioned
