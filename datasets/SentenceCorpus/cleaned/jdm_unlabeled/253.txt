 
previous research demonstrated bayesian reasoning performance improved if uncertainty information presented natural frequencies rather than single-event probabilities
questionnaire study number college students replicated effect but also found performance-boosting benefits natural frequency presentation occurred primarily participants who scored high numeracy
finding suggests even comprehension manipulation natural frequencies requires certain threshold numeracy abilities beneficial effects natural frequency presentation may not general previously believed
 introduction 
bayesian reasoning performance improved if uncertainty information presented natural frequencies
gigerenzer hoffrage argue evolutionary point view suggests mind tuned frequency formats information format humans encountered long before advent probability theory
although there some disagreement among researchers about reason why natural frequency presentations facilitate bayesian reasoning result they do improve performance well established
current paper examine whether natural frequency presentation facilitates bayesian reasoning among some people more than others
one result suggests does study bramwell west salmon
they presented bayesian pregnancy screening scenario obstetricians midwives pregnant women women's companions
participants were told base rate birth defect hit rate false alarm rate prenatal test
they were asked estimate posterior probability given abnormal test result baby actually birth defect
accurate responses were more frequent when scenario was presented terms natural frequencies rather than probabilities
interestingly effect presentation format was limited obstetricians
other three groups performance was equally poor both presentation formats
thus facilitative effect natural frequency format does not appear universal
natural frequencies benefit only some types reasoners
one factor may help explain result numeracy
numeracy skill defined ability process basic probability numerical concepts been studied association number decision tasks because many judgments decisions rely heavily mathematical concepts
example gurmankin baron armstrong found more numerate people more trusting more comfortable physician's risk communication when includes numeric statement risk than when does not whereas less numerate people more trusting if given non-numeric risk statements
peters et al found compared their counterparts highly numerate individuals more likely retrieve use appropriate numerical principles thus making themselves less susceptible framing effects tasks involving numbers
interest explore whether high numerates benefit more than low numerates uncertainty information presented natural frequencies rather than single-event probabilities
present study college students solved two bayesian reasoning problems
each participant one problem was presented probability format other natural frequency format
