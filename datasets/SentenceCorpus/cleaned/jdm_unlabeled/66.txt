 
current field study compares time preferences young adults similar ages but two very different environments one more dangerous uncertain than other
soldiers college students control group teenagers answered questionnaires about their time preferences
during mandatory service soldiers live violent atmosphere where they face great uncertainty about near future high risk mortality measured probability survival
university students teenagers live much calmer environment tested performance only periodically
soldier-subjects show relatively high subjective discount rates when compared other two groups
suggest higher subjective discount rate among soldiers result high perceived risk army institution higher mortality risk
 introduction 
subjective discount rate rate at individuals trade current value future outcome
rate varies person person depending each one's willingness wait
general individual who values present more than future will higher subjective discount rate than person who places more value future
current paper examine how military service influences time preference soldiers
compare time discount soldiers israel defense forces idf time discount university high school students
since its establishment number state israel had universal conscription all youths male female upon completing high school at age number
law soldiers serve full-time two females three males years then continue serving reserves
idf plays important part israeli society supported national consensus israel population
soldiers unique group because they drafted at young age prior beginning their tertiary education earn similar very low salaries
their employer harsh total institution-where all parts life individuals under its authority subordinate dependent upon hierarchy organization-with very clear values
soldiers intensively trained tested first day basic training
conversely university students israel usually work higher earnings
they live much calmer environment tested performance only periodically
few studies tested soldiers' decision making compare them civilians
warner pleeter studied choices regarding early retirement plans older soldiers us army
soldiers were heterogenic age education earnings choose join army profession
recent article haerem et al compared educated military decision makers business students found soldiers exhibited high levels self-efficacy correlated risk-seeking behavior
unlike other studies our study first test time preferences young soldiers who did not join army career choice but rather were drafted mandatory service
order ensure similar test conditions soldiers other young adults distributed questionnaires both groups when they were travelling train
found soldiers higher subjective discount rate when compared similar age groups
rest paper organized follows section number discuss risk morbidity mortality their relation our research
section number presents hypothesis
section number describes experimental design
section number presents results regarding time preferences soldiers students
