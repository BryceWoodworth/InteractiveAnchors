recognition heuristic rh proposes situations where recognition correlated decision criterion recognized objects will chosen more often than unrecognized ones regardless any other relevant information available about recognized object
past research investigated non-compensatory decision heuristic inference
here report two experiments preference using naturalistic consumer choice task
results revealed although recognition was powerful driver preferences was used compensatory rather than non-compensatory way
specifically additional information learned about recognized brand objects significantly affected choices
appears recognition processed compensatory manner combined other attributes preferential choice
 introduction 
tend like what know
studies mere exposure effect decades experience product manufacturers advertisers confirm our preferences products other objects tend related their familiarity brand awareness
but what precisely mechanism familiarity recognition guides choice
article asks whether choice sometimes guided non-compensatory mechanism recognition heuristic rh
rh been primarily investigated inferential choice domains larger city frankfurt koblenz
simple tool adaptive tool-box human judgment decision making proposed gigerenzer todd abc research group
researchers shown unlike classical decision strategies e g linear regression bayesian models aim maximize integration relevant knowledge gain statistically optimal prediction decision criterion efficient inferences drawn minimal knowledge case mere recognition
additionally rh was proposed most applicable situations where knowledge limited not all entities choice set recognized
there various other domains recognition knowledge limited where choices depend preferences rather than inferences
one obvious example consumer choice
everyone knows firms invest huge sums money advertising
although many advertisements informative often their purpose simply increase brand awareness
firms attempt repeatedly expose consumers brand names hope achieving positive brand image customer loyalty
present study aims investigate exact role brand recognition consumer choice
more specifically aims see whether under certain circumstances participants will rely recognition choice strategy regardless any other information they may about recognized well-known brand
instance when choosing between two brands chocolate only one brand recognized participants may employ simple heuristic choose recognized brand
alternatively they may combine recognition other information known about brand whether manufacturer good poor environmental record
present research therefore extends past studies recognition heuristic into new domain preferential choice
