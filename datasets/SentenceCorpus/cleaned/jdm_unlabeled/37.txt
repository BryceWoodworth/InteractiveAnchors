present research suggests assumption might usefully reexamined
two experiments endowment effect examine role subjective ownership independently manipulating factual ownership i e what participants were told about ownership physical possession object
allowed us disentangle effects two factors typically confounded
found significant effect possession but not factual ownership monetary valuation object
moreover effect was mediated participants' feelings ownership were enhanced physical possession object
thus endowment effect did not rely factual ownership per se but was result subjective feelings ownership induced possession object
feelings ownership appeared lead individuals include object into their endowment shift their reference point accordingly
potential implications directions future research discussed
 introduction 
thaler presented half students class cornell university coffee mugs then allowed them trade their less fortunate classmates
surprisingly little trading occurred
those holding mugs set their minimum selling prices too high those without mugs set their maximum offers too low many trades clear
apparently briefly owning coffee mug raised its value owner sufficiently price beyond reach most non-owners
thaler coined term endowment effect describe result goods included one's endowmentthat goods one ownsare valued more highly than identical goods not held endowment
non-owner's potential gain acquisition was apparently smaller than owner's potential loss sale
effect since been widely replicated
endowment effect commonly interpreted result loss aversion core ingredient prospect theory
losses outcomes below some reference point weighted substantially more than gains outcomes above reference point evaluation choice options
if one initially owns object prospect losing seen relatively large loss
if one does not prospect acquiring seen relatively small gain
hence small volume trading thaler's study endowment shifted reference points thus assessment what loss what gain
more recently researchers started examine more detail psychological mechanisms driving effect
example strahilevitz loewenstein found valuation object increase duration ownership possibly due increased adaptation psychological accustoming new material situation
novemsky kahneman present evidence loss aversion thus endowment effect found goods owned consumption but not goods owned exchange thus given up intended rather than losses endowment
carmon ariely report findings suggesting endowment effects explained result buyers sellers having different cognitive perspectives exchange
results suggest there more endowment effect than simple factual ownership object
present research try elucidate further what leads development sense endowment subsequently higher monetary valuations
concept ownership one's endowment goods appears involve two elements legal entitlement subjective ownership
elements may imperfectly correlated
one may feel some sense ownership items one does not own e g borrowed bicycle behave owner might e g resenting owner's demand its return
conversely one may feel little ownership items one does fact own e g newly-bought computer require some period experience use before feeling full ownership
pierce kostova dirks propose elaborate psychological model based extensive literature review antecedents experiences consequences psychological subjective ownership
research suggests subjective feelings ownership more complex than simple legal entitlement
pierce et al model feelings ownership induced controlling entity e g through possession becoming familiar e g through actual imagined use investing self into e g through identification
thaler most studies endowment effect two elements ownership confounded
seems clear students who received mugs understood they legally owned them could if they wished sell them others
they also were given physical possession mugs could inspect control them
extent elements led feelings subjective ownership unclear
possession alone even absence factual ownership induce feelings ownership
indeed because immediate control provides over entity possession might more psychologically salient stronger effect feelings ownership object thus its monetary evaluation than does factual ownership
following two experiments examine relative contributions factual subjective ownership endowment effect separately manipulating factual ownership possession object
design allows examining whether endowment effect driven factual ownership number possession number both
expect possession will induce stronger feelings ownership than pure factual ownership
arguing subjective sense endowmentrather than legal entitlementthat leads shift reference point makes not having object feel like loss rather than foregone gain
result possession will lead higher monetary evaluation whereas factual ownership itself will not
