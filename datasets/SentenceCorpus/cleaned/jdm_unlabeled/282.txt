found significant correlations between cognitive reflection all estimation measures correspondence tasks
our results suggest cognitive reflection thinking disposition includes more characteristics than originally proposed frederick
proposed cognitive reflection related concept actively open-minded thinking
concluded cognitive reflection thinking disposition interacts knowledge domain-specific heuristics characteristics environment may play essential role adaptation decision maker different environments situations
 introduction 
humans often violate tenets rationality ruled logic statistics expected utility theory other normative models rational decision making
instead making decisions judgments based those models humans tend use heuristics sometimes lead them commit systematic errors biases
nonetheless not all humans biased some them perform if they use normative models rationality
numerous studies shown adherence normative principles cognitive abilities thinking dispositions positively related
article aims investigate role thinking disposition  cognitive reflection  decision making
frederick defined cognitive reflection ability disposition resist reporting response first comes mind pp number developed cognitive reflection test crt order measure thinking disposition
frederick also proposed more general conception cognitive reflection based dual-system theories
briefly dual-system theories propose humans two cognitive systems system number 's processes quick effortless intuitive heuristic system number 's processes slow effortful reflective rule-based
based default-interventionist conception system number frederick identified two characteristics system number related cognitive reflection its capacity monitor system number 's outputs its capacity override system number 's functioning
research shown individual differences crt play role individual's decisions judgments tasks where their behavior could compared predictions normative models
those studies found crt was positively related choices predicted expected utility theory risky choice tasks
note however frederick also found domain gains high crt scorers chose more risky options than low crt scorers even when expected value risk option was lower than safe option
intertemporal choice frederick showed crt was positively related choosing patient options i e high crt scorers had lower discount rates than low crt scorers oechssler et al found almost significant difference same direction
furthermore oechssler et al found high crt scorers were better than low crt scorers at avoiding logical fallacies also they were less overconfident
article concerned three topics related cognitive reflection number do individual differences cognitive reflection measured crt influence behavior correspondence decision-making tasks those accuracy measured external criterion rather than internal consistency number does crt measure only ability disposition resist reporting response first comes mind
does also measure broader disposition actively open-minded thinking number does general knowledge account influence cognitive reflection decision making
does cognitive reflection influence decision making independently general knowledge
correspondence tasks those test correspondence participants' estimations facts world
example participant's estimations number inhabitants cities compared actual number inhabitants cities
theoretical interest correspondence tasks good performance them typically explained participants' use fast-and-frugal heuristics not adherence normative principles
far aware present study first one relating cognitive reflection measured crt correspondence decision-making tasks
previous research shown high crt scorers engage heuristic behavior tasks investigate participants' judgments but not whether judgments match facts world
cokely kelley found high performance crt was related more elaborative heuristic search
based results predicted cognitive reflection performance would positively related correspondence tasks use heuristics helpful
second topic investigated was whether crt only measures disposition refrain reporting intuitive response suggested cokely kelley crt also measures reflectiveness thoroughness decision making
if case cognitive reflection measured crt would more general thinking disposition analogous baron's concept actively open-minded thinking
third topic was concerned alternative explanations role crt decision-making tasks
since crt positively correlates different types general knowledge  e g numeracy academic achievement  could argued relation between crt decision making explained individual differences general knowledge
tested using tasks did not require numeracy skills
