 
study compares judgments fairness economic actions among survey populations switzerland both student non-student groups people's republic china earlier kahneman knetsch thaler surveys canadians
findings suggest fairness concerns matter among all groups general patterns what was was not considered fair were similar
however there were also some significant differences influence fairness being weaker two chinese samples than groups western countries influence being weakest chinese student population wage related topics
whole almost no significant gender differences were found any new surveys
 introduction 
fairness concerns often play important role people's choices decisions
commonly observe people forgoing some opportunities maximize their own material well-being out concern others adherence standards fairness
evidence consistent behaviour also been documented numerous studies involving both survey responses hypothetical scenarios decisions real monetary payoffs
although there little empirical evidence one way other judgments fairness might well differ among different populations
bicchieri suggests there no particular unique norm fairness but one several might invoked depending context
even though there may broad consensus within given culture about how example goods opportunities should allocated distributed there may differences between them
although past studies shown nature importance fairness concerns how people commonly respond unfair behaviour they nearly all been conducted western countries cultures
very little evidence been reported fairness concerns eastern countries people's republic china
although bian keller reported survey responses some questions kkt chinese mba students shenhai comparing results one city china those usa infer between-country differences might subject some criticism
suggested oosterbeek et al within-country differences same magnitude between-country differences
one purpose present study survey chinese respondents three cities their responses all four types fairness norms summarized kkt compare their judgments those people different cultures
i choose canada switzerland p r
china comparison using common methodology facilitate comparisons
since study based kkt canada used baseline besides because canadian survey was conducted over two decades ago provides limited comparison judgments over time period switzerland chosen sample availability its having much more common canada than china terms culture level economic development
further comparisons judgments also made between student non-student populations china between male female respondents china switzerland
findings indicate fairness matters among all respondent groups generally similar ways
there however some differences particularly between chinese respondents those both western countries
all studies were based survey responses same questions involving simple narrative vignettes used kkt their early telephone interview survey study fairness among canadian respondents
questions allowed tests example extent people regarded wage cuts fair response market conditions when employers were were not making normal profits
framing questions terms vignettes were similarly useful determining influence reference profits what was found important role reference transaction shaping people's judgments fairness  often independent contrary traditional economic justifications particular actions
research extends growing empirical literature examines patterns people's fairness judgments  much based not only methods but findings what people judged fair acceptable actions what they judged unfair kkt study
frey et al example used questions similar those kkt study surveys german swiss populations
their findings were much same terms respondents' negative responses use price eliminate excess demand
shiller boycko korobov investigated people soviet union united states some questions again similar those used kkt
some economically relatively minor differences similar patterns fairness judgments were found between soviet american respondents
both groups respondents considered unfair increase price response sudden surge excess demand finding large consistent kkt findings
general findings representative surveys showed consistent results
however although showing how people canada some other countries evaluate fairness various economic behaviours they limited western cultures were conducted some considerable time ago
they provide little direct evidence how people other cultures might react similar questions given present interest particularly people p r
china
some related studies been carried out china but they used other methods populations
example bian keller found judgments chinese business graduate students differed those random household sample canadians fairness exploiting added market power short-term profit
while interesting perhaps indicative possibility wider disparity difference between respondents may well limited particular sample population
another study bian keller used different sample government business people ask about life death issues rather than about common economic behaviors while again interesting useful studies decisions special groups sample questions allow little comparability kkt present studies
latter studies involved respondents more generally representative wider populations questions concerning fairness economic actions decisions intended protect profits exploit market power allocate gains depart previous reference transactions
present study also contributes literature cross-cultural investigation human fairness judgments providing some empirical evidence used test existing related theories
present study china switzerland canada compared might differ political social economic cultural aspects
due co-existence political socioeconomic cultural differences between countries comparison attributing cross-country difference cultural factor was challenged
however chen tang provided some evidence culture's role affecting people's economic behavior might more significant than non-cultural factors
order explore influence within-country cultural difference they chose xiamen lhasa tibet china comparison used singapore control sample because its similarity culture xiamen heterogeneity political systems social institutions level economic development
they found no significant differences people's behavior ultimatum game between xiamen singapore but people lhasa differed former two samples suggesting influence culture dominates non-cultural factors
thus considering cultural discrepancies between china western group two dimensions see table number including power distance individualism proposed hofstede culture expected play critical role affecting people's fairness judgments
toc paragraph hypothesis number  h number class paragraph sec anchor  hypothesis number h number sec end  chinese people people switzerland canada diverge fairness judgments some economic actions
more chinese people judge same action fair than their counterparts
hypothesis number formulated based mainly hofstede
seen table number group switzerland canada china opposite sides along axis each index china higher score power distance index while lower score individualism index
according hofstede large power distance indicates large extent less powerful members society within country accept power distributed unequally people generally accept fact power basic fact society antedate good evil its legitimacy irrelevant power-holders entitled privileges
similarly collectivism contrast high individualism associated norm interests group outweigh interests individuals group provides protection
study people whose actions judged all scenarios hold market power more less at same time most them represent interests organization group
so theories power distance collectivism predict chinese would more willing accept decisions power-holders groups supports hypothesis number
however inglehart's two dimensions culture seem contradict each other conjecturing people's fairness judgments
compared switzerland canada china evaluated less self-expressing consistent hypothesis number but more secular thus should less likely defer authority
made me propose alternative hypothesis number
toc paragraph hypothesis number b  h number class paragraph sec anchor  hypothesis number b h number sec end  more chinese people judge same action unfair than their counterparts
men women think behave differently many respects received much attention thus spurred studies gender differences
study also examined whether gender affects people's judgments fairness marketplace three new surveys
findings some gender studies judgments perceptions social preference fairness justice revealed males females might differ each other respect
fairness judgments example beldona namasivayam documented statistically significant differences where females perceived significantly less fairness across all pricing scenarios both discount surplus frames
so i expect gender differences exist
toc paragraph hypothesis number  h number class paragraph sec anchor  hypothesis number h number sec end  male female respondents differ their fairness judgments each three surveys
