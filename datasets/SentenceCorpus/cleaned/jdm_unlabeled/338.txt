three issues journal recognition heuristic been examined carefully many points view
comment here four themes use optimization models understand rationality heuristics generalization recognition input beyond binary judgment new conditions less-is-more effects importance specifying boundary conditions cognitive heuristics
 introduction 
galileo formalized movement objects his law falling bodies s s stevens described sensation stimulus intensity raised power behaviorists formulated laws learning equations no more complex than those encountered high school physics
simple models physics psychology driven much progress science
yet no model simple complex explain all behavior
beauty simple models one easily discover their limits their boundary conditions turn fosters clarity progress
law falling bodies does not hold generally works situations object starts rest there no air resistance gravitational force g does not change over distance fall
similarly laws learning do not hold every situation illustrated concept biological preparedness fact certain cs-ucs conditional stimulus  unconditional stimulus associations learned rapidly but not others
evolved organisms work multiple tools not one general principle
concept adaptive toolbox assumes individual culture species characterized set heuristics surviving uncertain world
heuristics exploit evolved learned core capacities simple order robust fast efficient
recognition heuristic one tools adaptive toolbox humans other animal species exploits recognition memory
journal devoted three special issues elaborating generalizing testing model proposed decade ago
reviewed progress made first decade before here would like comment some theoretical insights put forward contributions issues
