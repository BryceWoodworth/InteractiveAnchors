why does occur
answer question will help us answer related question why do good people ignore mass murder genocide
internet columnist frames question topic my paper why do ignore mass murder genocide
there no simple answer
not because insensitive suffering our fellow human beingswitness extraordinary efforts expend rescue someone distress
not because only care about identifiable victims similar skin color who live near us witness outpouring aid victims december number tsunami south asia
cannot simply blame our political leaders
although president bush been quite unresponsive murder hundreds thousands people darfur was clinton who ignored rwanda roosevelt who did little stop holocaust
behind every president who ignored mass murder were millions citizens whose indifference allowed them get away
it's not fear losing american lives battle necessarily deters us acting
not even taken quite safe steps could save many lives bombing radio stations rwanda were coordinating slaughter machete number number people number days supporting forces african union darfur just raising our powerful american voices threatening shoutstop killing
 opposed turning away silence
every episode mass murder unique raises unique social economic military political obstacles intervention
but repetitiveness atrocities ignored powerful people nations general public calls explanations may reflect some fundamental deficiency our humanitya deficiency once identified might possibly overcome
paper examines one fundamental mechanism may play role many if not all episodes mass-murder neglect
mechanism involves capacity experience affect positive negative feelings combine reasoned analysis guide our judgments decisions actions
many researchers begun study dance affect reason applies decision making
i shall draw research show how statistics mass murder genocide no matter how large numbers fail convey true meaning atrocities
numbers fail spark emotion feeling thus fail motivate action
genocide darfur real but do not feel reality
i shall conclude suggestions about how might make genocide feel real motivate appropriate interventions
i shall also argue cannot only depend our feelings about atrocities but addition must create commit ourselves institutional political responses based upon reasoned analysis our moral obligations stop mass annihilation innocent people
although i attempted fashion compelling explanation genocide neglect implications action story not complete
psychological account while based theory recent empirical studies clearly needs further testing development particularly examine more directly relationship between imagery affect sensitivity numbers
action implications remain elaborated legal scholars others
