 
study employs discrete choice experiment dce health-care sector test loss aversion theory derived reference-dependent preferences absolute subjective value deviation reference point generally greater when deviation represents loss than when same-sized change perceived gain
far known paper first use dce test loss aversion theory
dce highly suitable tool testing because estimates marginal valuations attributes based deviations reference point constant scenario
moreover loss aversion examined each attribute separately
another advantage dce applied non-traded goods non-tangible attributes
health-care event used empirical illustration loss aversion theory tested within context preference structures maternity-ward attributes estimated using data gathered number observations made sample number women who had recently given birth
seven hypotheses presented tested
overall significant support behavioral loss aversion theories was found
 introduction 
person's valuation benefit outcome choice often determined intrinsic consumption utility outcome itself combined its contrast reference point
most noteworthy manifestation reference-dependent preferences loss aversion absolute subjective value change endowment generally greater when deviation reference point represents loss than when same-sized change perceived gain
most systematic general theory kind probably tversky kahneman's reference-dependence model builds kahneman tversky's prospect theory
significance loss aversion highlighted camerer's review practical implications prospect theory seven out ten examples derived loss aversion hypothesis
recently koszegi rabin presented extended model reference-dependent preferences loss aversion claimed more generally applicable
numerous studies present evidence supporting loss aversion hypothesis
they include hartman et al hardie et al andreoni benartzi thaler camerer et al myagkov plott bowman et al jullien salanie genesove mayer
there also several studies looking at loss aversion medical domain
they include stalmeier bezembinder robinson et al bleichrodt pinto van osh et al
what reference point used individual evaluate gains positive deviations versus losses negative deviations
majority empirical studies examined traded goods reference point was endowment commodity under consideration
expectations were mentioned other researchers candidates reference point shalev used expectations his game-theoretic model koszegi rabin assumed person's reference point her rational expectations held recent past about outcomes
they specified rule endogenous derivation point within framework equilibrium utility-maximizing model
van osch et al argued goals aspirations influence reference point health domain
combining qualitative quantitative data they provided evidence reference point life-year certainty equivalent ce gambles explored psychology behind reference point
empirical study takes new different approach determination reference point testing loss aversion hypothesis
discrete choice experiments dces used estimation preference structure multi-dimensional consumption good service establishing relative importance different attributes provision good service under discussion vis-a-vis constant reference bundle
follows employment dce also facilitates testing loss aversion hypothesis each attribute separately
decomposition into attribute-specific components adds richness insight not obvious people loss averse regarding all kinds attributes there most probably different degrees loss aversion compared across attributes
far known first published study employs dces test attribute-specific loss aversion derived reference-dependent preferences
empirical illustration presented paper relates dce was conducted among number women who had recently given birth
their preferences five maternity-ward attributes number beds hospital room attitude staff toward patient medical staff's professionalism information transfer staff patients travel time residence hospital were estimated loss aversion was tested each attributes separately
main results study were loss aversion hypothesis was confirmed four five hospital attributes investigated
results were less conclusive travel time residence hospital
following section describes dce method employed estimation
third section presents econometric model followed hypotheses derived loss aversion theory
preference structures used test outlined hypotheses presented section number
