 introduction 
how good you at multitasking
how good you at remembering people's names
judgments people make about their own cognitive abilities vary greatly one person another
judgments about self also systematically biased relative judgments made others about us
often regard ourselves more competent than others better than what justified our actual performance
discouraging observations might people learn improve at most cognitive tasks
learning occurs not only at task levelwe get better at playing pianobut also at meta-levelwe become more attuned judging just how good at playing piano
examples illustrate several aspects what known cognitive developmental literatures metacognition knowledge people possess about their own cognitive abilities including beliefs about their own performance specific tasks
some psychologists argued metacognitive judgment secondary actual performance
according view knowledge skills required perform tasks certain domain also required judging one's ability domain
one corollary view metacognitive judgment domain-specific person who good at remembering things bad at understanding how others feel will relatively aware his good memory skills but relatively unaware his poor empathy skills
despite its intuitive appeal view been challenged confounding metacognitive judgment level performance
because subjective estimates performance never perfectly correlated actual performance judgments performance will regress toward mean participants who perform worst given domain will tend overestimate their ability domain while those performing best will tend underestimate
other words relation between actual performance subjective judgment may reflect statistical artifact rather than genuine relation between cognitive meta-cognitive levels
although biased beliefs about one's own skills norm biases often exacerbated psychiatric neurological disorders
denial deficit reduced self-awareness loss insight anosognosia all clinical terms broadly refer same phenomenon patient's distorted assessment her own skills
patient populations provide excellent opportunity test domain-specificity metacognitive judgment certain abilities become severely affected disease while others remain relatively unaffected
thus possible ask whether metacognitive judgments become distorted only affected domains distortion generalizes judgments spared domains
answer question so far been mixed
consistent domain-specificity hypothesis some studies reported cases patients hemiplegia who deny their paralysis but acknowledge limitations other domains
there also evidence failures awareness cluster around symptoms
example study denial dementia alzheimer's type dat factor analysis questionnaire data revealed two independent factors cognitive denial related length disease severity cognitive deficits behavioral denial related behavioral disinhibition inappropriate emotional displays
contrast other studies reported findings consistent domain-general deficit showing metacognitive errors extend beyond specific domain impairment
example patients probable dat been reported overestimate their performance not only memory but also visuo-spatial tasks
furthermore denial dat seems correlate more strongly frontal lobe deficit than memory problems despite latter being more typical dat
although denial deficit prevalent clinical setting may help us understand over-optimism healthy adults until not long ago research denial deficit had proceeded independently experimentally based literature metacognitive judgment
recently clinical experimental traditions become better integrated clinical researchers begun rely more heavily experimental paradigms
experimental designs useful comparing patients' judgments their performance their actual performance task
furthermore asking patient predict performance before task estimate after task possible assess metacognitive monitoring i e whether metacognitive judgment improves after experiencing task
experimental designs applied domains other than one primary clinical concern
feature becomes important when testing domain generality metacognitive judgment
patient populations our study consisted patients behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia ftd-b patients early dementia alzheimer type dat
although ftd-b insidious onset gradual progression its clinical presentation bears close resemblance cases orbitofrontal damage caused traumatic brain injury famous case phineas gage
ftd-b patients often described their spouses unable unwilling take other people's feelings into account when deciding how act
they often exhibit inappropriate social behavior changes personality poor decision making
at early stages disease many ftd-b patients deny having difficulties seem unconcerned about them
denial been documented social emotional domains but needs explored further domains relatively spared performance
contrast ftd-b patients early stages dat their social skills relatively spared
deficit dat primarily episodic memory
at early stages dat patients tend aware their deficit but awareness declines disease progresses
after describing ftd-b's denial deficit semi-structured interviews report two experiments examined whether ftd-b patients overestimate their performance relative dat patients healthy adults
pre post-test judgments performance were obtained attention task experiment number stroop task perception task experiment number change blindness task
testing metacognition two different domains attention perception neither prototypically impaired early dementia were able test domain-generality metacognitive judgments
