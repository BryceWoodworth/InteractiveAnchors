 introduction 
investigations recognition heuristic rh typically involve participants making judgments about items about they limited knowledge relative sizes cities usa
example participant might presented two cities san diego san antonio asked bigger
classic work goldstein gigerenzer assumed participant will guess if they recognize neither items they will use whatever additional knowledge available make decision if they recognize both items crucially if they recognize only one items they will choose item larger without consulting any other cues searching further information recognition heuristic rh
because items larger size more likely encountered hence more likely recognized recognition-magnitude correlation
recognizing one two items thus useful cue choosing recognized item
if both items recognized however additional knowledge needed make decision additional knowledge may very limited
recognition-driven inference give rise less-is-more effect lime whereby individuals who recognize many items often perform worse than individuals who recognize fewer items
lime counter-intuitive finding predicted occur under given circumstances if rh applied
counter-intuitive nature lime prediction allows strong test rh been used rhetoric device promote heuristic
evidence lime also been observed empirically but counter failures observe effect also been cited attempts refute rh
at least originally introduced lime mathematical necessity given certain assumptions rather than proof recognition-based inference
nevertheless consensus appears observation lime implies recognition heuristic was employed use knowledge will dilute reduce size lime
here explore whether limes also mathematical necessities if those assumptions altered somewhat  specifically if inference no longer recognition-based but instead makes reference some form knowledge
limes need not appear only when rh studied isolation
they also predicted formal models knowledge-based inference if those models exploit recognition principle
gigerenzer goldstein used appearance effect part their comparison five integration algorithms take best ttb algorithm
ttb all integration algorithms were implemented each case recognition was used cue if only one item was recognized p number
unsurprisingly all six algorithms produced non-monotonic relationship between recognition correct inference
however will demonstrate limes produced knowledge-based decision-making processes use neither recognition-driven inference nor related speed-of-retrieval inference schooler hertwig shown produces similar advantageous effects moderate over lesser forgetting rates
first aim paper prove analytical means limes produced knowledge-based decision-rules
they not unique recognition-driven inference cannot therefore viewed providing unconditional support hypothesis
