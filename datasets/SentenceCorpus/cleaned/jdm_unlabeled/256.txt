 
two studies mobile phone purchase decisions investigated consumers' decision strategies newly developed process tracing tool called interactive process tracing iapt
tool combination several process tracing techniques active information search mouselab retrospective verbal protocol
after repeatedly choosing one four mobile phones participants formalized their strategy so could used make choices them
choices made identified strategies correctly predicted observed choices number percent experiment number number percent experiment number cases
moreover experiment number directly compared mouselab eye tracking respect their impact information search strategy description
found only minor differences between two methods
conclude iapt useful research tool identify choice strategies using eye tracking technology did not increase its validity beyond gained mouselab
 introduction 
identifying processes underlie judgment decision making been great interest researchers several decades already
context two major paradigms been used structural modeling process tracing
structural modeling aims uncover psychological processes relating provided information decisions judgments typically via multiple linear regression analysis
parameters models thought represent important features participants' decision strategies instance if particular attribute receives high weight regression equation interpreted being very important decision maker
despite its popularity approach been criticized ignoring predecisional phase processes take place between stimulus presentation final decision
example svenson concluded gradually becoming clear human decision making cannot understood simply studying final decisions p number similarly payne braunstein carroll argued input-output analyses been used most decision research not fully adequate develop test process models decision behavior p number
response other objections against structural modeling payne others developed process tracing approach adapting methods research human problem solving
opposed structural modeling aim process tracing directly describe processes taking place during predecisional phase
achieve participants' information search integration closely observed while they work decision task
frequently used methods within paradigm information boards verbal protocols recording eye movements method active information search
following briefly describe process tracing methodologies discuss their strengths weaknesses
then present new tool called interactive process tracing iapt developed identify decision processes underlying preferential choice
iapt uses various elements process tracing measures mentioned above combine their strengths simultaneously overcome some their weaknesses
subsequently describe two experiments successfully applied iapt identify participants' decision strategies
