article review clarify issues emerged our initial work including distinction between recognition evaluation process
there now considerable evidence i recognition heuristic predicts inferences substantial proportion individuals consistently even presence one more contradicting cues ii people adaptive decision makers accordance increases larger recognition validity decreases situations when validity low wholly indeterminable iii presence contradicting cues some individuals appear select different strategies
little known about individual differences how precisely model alternative strategies
although some researchers attributed judgments inconsistent use recognition heuristic compensatory processing little research compensatory models been reported
discuss extensions recognition model open questions unanticipated results surprising predictive power recognition forecasting
 introduction 
herbert simon's emphasis recognition memory limited search starting point was only small logical step towards recognition heuristic exploits potential information lack recognition
accordance simon's emphasis computational models recognition principle was first called was formulated building block take-the-best other heuristics order model inferences memory
subsequently was realized initial building block could function stand-alone model same type inferences was named recognition heuristic
reality recognition heuristic was not derived logical manner
serendipity luck finding something one was not looking assisted its birth
gigerenzer hoffrage kleinbolting had deduced probabilistic mental models theory situation hard-easy effect would disappear
his dissertation ulrich hoffrage set out test prediction he needed two sets questions one hard one easy
hoffrage chose questions concerning populations american cities german cities respectively hard easy german students-or so everyone thought
surprisingly students scored slightly higher when tested representative sample american cities than german ones
result ruined experiment
how could people score more correct answers domain they knew less
days our research group failed think cognitive process makes more out less
finally anton kuhberger pointed out explanation was tucked away gigerenzer et al article mentioned familiarity probabilistic cue
if person heard one city but not other lack recognition informative indicating recognized city probably larger population
german cities participants could not rely recognition heuristic-they knew too much
serendipitous discovery also revealed crucial condition successful reliance recognition substantial correlation between recognition population recognition validity representative sampling cities
return condition later
one possible reason why took us so long find answer was our training classical statistical models
weighted linear model adding cue predictor never decrease its fit unadjusted r same true bayes' rule
more-is-better principle holds fitting parameters known data but not necessarily predicting what one does not already know german students had do
good cognitive heuristic however should excel foresight well hindsight
possibility people could sometimes do better less knowledge generated much interest controversy social sciences media
may number bbc intrigued idea less being more decided test effect their radio number more less program
listeners new york london were asked whether detroit milwaukee larger population
exploratory studies his dissertation one us had found about number percent american students answered correctly detroit compared number percent corresponding group german participants
bbc not known running tightly controlled studies so were somewhat uneasy about whether they could reproduce less-is-more effect
but they did
new york number percent listeners got answer right whereas london number percent did so-as close one hope informal replication
our initial work recognition heuristic stimulated dozens articles comprising theoretical advancements critique above all progress
work contributed much understanding potential limits simple model but also believe its broad reception represents larger shift research practice
change occurs three directions begin our review progress made last decade two key processes govern use recognition heuristic recognition evaluation latter corresponds judgment its ecological rationality
