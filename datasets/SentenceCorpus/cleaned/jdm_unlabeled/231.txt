 introduction 
there no question concept natural psychological commercial importance modern developed world
clearly positive attribute especially when applied foods
recent years some studies shed light lay meanings natural
one particular feature lay meanings relevance present paper
appears naturalness something related more its history contact humans than actual chemical composition
understandably americans rate spring water natural tomato paste much more natural than those same entities after small amount natural substance e g natural minerals sugar been added them
action involves both process adding change content
what striking if stipulated all additives subsequently removed resultant substance rated less natural than substance additive
substance had additive was then removed been subjected two processes but now identical content original natural substance
set results confirmed opposite sequence removing component natural substance then replacing removed component rozin number argues strongly importance process opposed content natural judgments
while human contact agency been identified number authors enhancing perceptions risk may type contact critical
domestication plants animals associated intensive human involvement major changes genotypes phenotypes yet domesticated species rated only slightly less natural than their wild equivalents
other hand insertion single gene into wild species rated producing very large decrease naturalness
perhaps there something about going inside produce changes lead judgments unnaturalness
present paper add another feature lay naturalness judgments believe points more general asymmetry judgments
had not anticipated finding report advance studies described
broad large survey individuals six countries about their attitudes food health included number questions about naturalness including open-ended item asking definition naturalness
analyzing results discovered major importance no additives feature naturalness very rare mention removal substances subtractives
some other results survey presented here illustrations additivity dominance judgments naturalness perhaps more general additivity dominance
