 
laboratory studies choice decision making among real monetary rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common real life
when laboratory rewards large they almost always hypothetical
applying laboratory results meaningfully real-life situations important know extent choices among hypothetical rewards correspond choices among real rewards whether variation magnitude hypothetical rewards affects behavior meaningful ways
present study compared real hypothetical monetary rewards two experiments
experiment number participants played temporal discounting game incorporates logic repeated prisoner's-dilemma pd game versus tit-for-tat choice one alternative defection pd terminology resulted small-immediate reward choice other alternative cooperation pd terminology resulted larger reward delayed until following trial
larger-delayed reward was greater half groups than other half
rewards also differed type across groups multiples real nickels hypothetical nickels hypothetical hundred-dollar bills
all groups significantly increased choice larger delayed reward over number trials experiment
over last number trials cooperation was significantly higher when difference between larger smaller hypothetical rewards was greater
reward type real hypothetical made no significant difference cooperation most measures
experiment number real hypothetical rewards were compared social discounting-the decrease value giver reward social distance increases receiver reward
social discount rates were well described hyperbolic function
discounting rates real hypothetical rewards did not significantly differ
results add evidence results experiments hypothetical rewards validly apply everyday life
 introduction 
research choice using hypothetical rewards participants asked imagine alternatives-to choose they would if alternative rewards were real
research assumes participants successful imaginative task
one potential problem using hypothetical questions psychological research participants may not capable required imaginary act
people often cannot predict what they will do certain situations alcoholic may believe morning he will not drink at party held evening
but then he may well drink
even if he asked reflect his behavior at past parties he may not remember how much he drank
task involving degree altruistic behavior dictator game where participants asked how much initial monetary endowment they willing give another participant no explicit consequence giving small amount even nothing participant might say she would give more money recipient when gift hypothetical than she would if money were real
participants want experimenters believe they altruistic hypothetical rewards costs nothing altruistic
because demand characteristics economists some psychologists been reluctant recognize validity choices among hypothetical rewards
reviews game-theory decision experiments found real monetary rewards stronger incentives than nominally equivalent hypothetical rewards
kuhberger schulte-mecklenbeck perner unlike most prior studies unlike experiment number present study compared large real rewards directly large hypothetical rewards
they studied double-or-nothing gambles all combinations positive negative framing b small large rewards c hypothetical real rewards
they found strong inter-group effects framing magnitude reward expected but choices participants who imagined hypothetical gamble did not differ choices participants gambling real money
moreover studies comparing delay discounting real hypothetical rewards found both reward types yield hyperbolic functions failed find significant differences steepness discounting depending type reward
although failure find significance does not itself mean there no differences existence significant differences steepness delay discounting hypothetical well real rewards when other variables been varied increases confidence addicts non-addicts alike successfully imagined real-world choices
example johnson bickel found strong correspondence r number between degree discounting hypothetical choices real rewards one randomly selected outcome actually given
whether not hypothetical rewards effects similar those real rewards important issue interpreting laboratory studies decision choice
if effects real hypothetical rewards similar then rewards laboratory may varied over wide ranges limitations number participants will not constrained monetary considerations
example steepness discounting decrease reward value varies inversely amount delayed reward but directly amount probabilistic reward
hypothetical delayed probabilistic rewards green et al study varied number number number would been practically impossible done study real rewards
but more evidence experimental participants choose similarly between lesser amounts real hypothetical rewards more confidence there will participants choosing among larger hypothetical rewards successfully imagining how they would choose if rewards were real
experiment number compared real hypothetical rewards prisoner's dilemma pd type game versus tit-for-tat
figure number shows pd contingency matrix used experiment number
number person pd game player player b each choose between cooperating c defecting d
each player receives reward determined combination both players' choices
case number  number  number  number reward matrix figure number player will earn number number number number reward units depending number possible choice combinations chosen
if both cooperate each receives moderately high reward number units if both defect each receives moderately low reward number units but if one cooperates other defects cooperator receives very low reward number unit while defector receives very high reward number units
strategy called tit-for-tat been found increase cooperation repeated pd games
suppose player-b rigidly plays tit-for-tat if cooperates trial n b will cooperate trial n number if defects trial n b will defect trial n number
when b cooperates receives number units cooperating number units defecting when b defects receives only number unit cooperating number units defecting
thus regardless a's choice gets number more units when b cooperates than when b defects
but if b rigidly playing tit-for-tat only way b will cooperate if previously cooperated
cooperating present trial gives up number unit but will gain number units next trial when b reciprocates
b's tit-for-tat strategy thus creates self-control problem smaller immediate gain defecting number unit trial versus larger delayed gain cooperating number units next trial
essentially if b rigidly plays tit-for-tat must choose lower two rewards present trial cooperate order get b cooperate b's cooperation turn allows choose between higher rewards next trial
dashed line figure number b shows a's average reward function a's percent cooperation b playing tit-for-tat
optimum strategy except very last trial always cooperate averaging number units per trial
since b's tit-for-tat behavior rigidly determined b's place may taken experimental apparatus-as was experiment number
prior experiments number  number  number  number matrix versus tit-for-tat participants learned cooperate over repeated trials
number  number  number  number matrix where delayed reward was number units players learned cooperate faster higher asymptote than number  number  number  number matrix where delayed reward was number units
delay b's reciprocation time between trials increases its probability decreases a's cooperation decreases proportionally
computer game played experiment number replicated pd versus tit-for-tat contingencies but did away pretense there was another player player b making independent choices
typical pd versus tit-for-tat game participants had choose lower two available rewards present trial number rather than number number rather than number order able choose between pair higher rewards number number rather than number number next trial
given number pd versus tit-for-tat self-control game number self-control been found vary inversely steepness individual's delay discount function number steepness delay discount functions been found not significantly different real hypothetical rewards expected type reward real versus hypothetical nickels would weak effect no effect cooperation present experiment
whether cooperation would affected increasing all hypothetical rewards factor number number number number number number would depend whether self-control function ratio difference amounts immediate delayed rewards
choice experiments humans indicate reward ratios rather than differences count situations
thus expected cooperation would not significantly affected increasing all rewards proportionally
however did expect increasing only delayed reward cooperation while leaving immediate reward defection constant changing matrix number  number  number  number number  number  number  number would increase cooperation significantly
pd game experiment number normally social game where alternatives maximization benefit oneself versus maximization benefit another player
tit-for-tat contingency substitutes participant's own future self other player changes game self-control situation
experiment number studied true social choice
participants chose between larger rewards another person smaller rewards themselves
both experiments tested efficacy hypothetical versus real monetary rewards
