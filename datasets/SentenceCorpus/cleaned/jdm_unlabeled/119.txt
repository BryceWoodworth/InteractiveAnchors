 
magical beliefs about contagion via contact may emerge when people overgeneralize real-world mechanisms contamination beyond their appropriate boundaries
do people similarly overextend knowledge airborne contamination mechanisms
previous work shown very young children believe merely being close contamination source contaminate item asked whether same hyper-avoidant intuition also reflected adults' judgments
two studies measured adults' ratings desirability object had made contact source contamination object nearby had made no contact contaminant object far away had also made no contact
adults showed clear proximity effect wherein objects near contamination source were perceived less desirable than those far away even though separate group adults unanimously acknowledged contaminants could not possibly made contact either nearby far-away object study number
proximity effect also remained robust when third group adults was explicitly told no contaminating particles had made contact objects at any time study number
discuss implications our findings extending scope magical contagion effects beyond contact principle understanding persistence intuitive theories despite broad acceptance science-based theories constraining interpretations developmental work proximity beliefs
 introduction 
people often resist reconciling their intuitive beliefs about world more recently learned theories uncovered science
example people may intuitively cling belief catching cold directly caused exposure cold temperatures
although scientific research revealed alternative mechanisms e g rhinovirus transmission come broadly accepted lay public people may nonetheless behave accordance their initial belief
real-world perspective our intuitive theories critical examine because although they often irrational unsupported science they still strongly influence our behaviors
instance people's excessive avoidance aids patients despite explicit knowledge hiv cannot transmitted via casual contact partially fueled non-scientific intuitive theories contamination
general irrational magical beliefs may emerge when people's core intuitive knowledge assumptions about major domains inappropriately overgeneralized other domains situations
example beliefs about contamination correct within biological domain overextended psychological domain yielding behaviors consistent belief socially disliked person somehow transmit undesirable properties onto objects he she touches
perhaps most well-known overextensions domain knowledge magical contagion effect adults wherein people permanently reject objects had come into even brief innocuous contact aversive source
example adults rejected thoroughly washed sweater worn homeless person juice touched sterilized cockroach
instances there no real danger contamination yet even when any physical justification rejection removed e g via washing sterilization people continue reject contacted object
studies rozin colleagues demonstrated modern adults' adherence several key features anthropologically historically documented magical law contagion fundamentally states objects once contact always contact
first people behave though physical contact critical undesirable properties transmitted second contagion characterized dose insensitivity even briefest most negligible contact believed transmit substantial amount undesirable properties then transmitted other objects third contagion characterized relative permanence believed persist long time after contact ceased impervious washing sterilization
rozin colleagues thereby clearly argued showed contact central characteristic magical contagion effect
current studies asked whether adults also adhere magical beliefs about contamination nearby sources even complete absence contact proximity effect henceforth
given absence contact proximity effect conceptually distinct magical law contagion once contact always contact
theory existence proximity effect highly plausible if classic magical contagion effect driven overgeneralization real-world contamination mechanisms previously argued
proximity effect if obtained could readily construed overextension known mechanisms airborne contamination situations clearly impossible
there some prior evidence very young children behave though item contaminated just being near contaminant
one developmental study example springer belk told children one several stories about boy who drank glass juice
their physical contact story bug first fell into juice was removed their proximity story bug was near juice but never made contact
most number  number year-olds their study rejected juice only physical contact story
contrast significant portion number  number year-olds their study also rejected juice proximity story demonstrating proximity effect
given apparent developmental shift between age groups showing proximity effect researchers generally attributed effect insufficient knowledge magical thinking very young children suggesting may reflect ignorance real-world mechanisms contamination
indeed there been little no evidence suggest otherwise experiments proximity effect rarely been attempted adults who presumably know correct mechanisms contamination
if even most minimal contact source was clearly completely eliminated would adults still behave though contamination occurs
whether adults show overextension knowledge about airborne contamination open question
one possibility adulthood naive radically inaccurate theories contamination been edited replaced more scientifically grounded theories
alternatively intuitions may run deeply persistently only overridden specific learned cases bug-and-juice scenarios
example older children adults may repeatedly encountered bug-and-juice scenarios real life explicitly learned accept juice proximal contaminant despite their intuitions
our study used scenarios even adults would not encounter frequently thereby increasing our ability measure their intuitive unpracticed responses
previously only toyoma reported preliminary evidence proximity effect both children adults using verbally described scenarios child came upon glass found had contaminant e g roach either inside next glass
however study was very ambiguous whether contact contaminant had ever occurred before child's encounter them e g live roach could crawled anywhere prior moment making perfectly reasonable reject glass
critical problem given work dose insensitivity principle repeatedly shown even briefest tiniest point contact still treated contact following magical law contagion
therefore remains unknown whether adults would show true proximity effect they reject item while believing its contamination was physically impossible
similarly studies using chain contagion tasks cannot construed definitive tests proximity effect
tasks clean pencil touched contaminant second clean pencil then touched first pencil so total number pencils contamination judgments made each pencil chain
studies showed adults' judgments contamination decrease moving down chain never come close zero
however paradigm contact clearly occurred at each point chain
therefore contamination beliefs about second pencil explained second pencil made physical contact now-contaminated first pencil magical law contagion allowed first pencil transmit contagion
adults' judgments task thereby demonstrated adherence magical law contagion its principles e g physical contact dose insensitivity permanence but task does not constitute clear test proximity effect
finally well-known study wherein people rejected fudge shaped look like feces cannot reasonably reinterpreted having shown proximity effect
although no contact contaminant was involved study paradigm neither was effect proximity contaminant tested
study there was no contaminant object could proximal
rozin et al instead designed fudge-resembling-feces study test conceptually distinct anthropologically documented law sympathetic magic known law similarity holds appearance reality e g if looks like feces must also share some other properties feces
accordingly study demonstrates modern adults adhere law similarity but does not indeed was never intended address magical law contagion once contact always contact possibility proximity effect
thus new investigation was needed clearly test proximity effect
current studies used vignettes pre-tested ensure was clear contact contaminants had never occurred
modified rozin colleagues' well-known paradigm they asked participants rate desirability having contact objects had previously had contact different sources
current work departed clearly rozin colleagues' task participants rated desirability having contact objects had been varying degrees proximity different sources
contact aversive source was eliminated critical conditions measure effect proximity
