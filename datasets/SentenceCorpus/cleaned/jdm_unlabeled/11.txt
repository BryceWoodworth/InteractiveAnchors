 introduction 
traditional approach study judgment decision making jdm compare judgment decision considered judgment about what do standard benchmark
comparison enables evaluation whether particular judgment good bad relative standard
normative models provide standards valuable because their clear sets rules axioms those derived economics expected utility theory mathematics probability theory used test predictions about human behavior
when behavior deviates predictions normative models  i e biases observed  attempts made ascertain why often techniques overcoming biases prescribed
approach its focus deviations normative models contrasts ideal homo oeconomicus apparent reality cognitive miser even loser been enormously influential useful
however not been without its critics
both metaphors fall short psychology's actual goal because they tend define human decision making what not consequence jdm research tended follow its own path some would argue become disconnected much psychology general cognitive psychology particular
disconnection great pity given many issues at core understanding human judgment decision making necessarily central wider goal understanding human cognition
papers special issue judgment decision making grew symposium held at max planck institute research collective goods focused one area jdm research believe will continue benefit its overlap more mainstream cognitive psychology
area multi-attribute judgment symposium explored recent advances cognitive modeling approaches been brought bear basic question how make judgments when faced multiple pieces information
number years since seminal attempt john payne make jdm research more cognitive wide range approaches cognitive psychology been applied question
our aim issue provide reader up-to-date overview approaches emphasize important influential advances made taking interface between jdm cognitive psychology seriously
contrasting different approaches allows identification possible boundary conditions their appropriateness valid models cognitive processing hope will suggest fruitful avenues future research
paper structured follows begin brief introduction serves highlight things know about cognition should incorporated into models multi-attribute judgment then discuss briefly how aspects addressed some models considered contributors special issue
collection models however cannot simply viewed complementary accounts since they sometimes conflict respect fundamental assumptions
