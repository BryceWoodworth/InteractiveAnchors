 
very small but cumulated decreases food intake may sufficient significant effects even erasing obesity over period years
two studies one lab study other real-world study examine effect manipulating position different foods restaurant menu
items placed at beginning end list their category options were up twice popular when they were placed center list
given effect placing healthier menu items at top bottom item lists less healthy ones their center e g sugared drinks vs calorie-free drinks should result some increase favor healthier food choices
 introduction 
obesity growing problem throughout world
fighting via dieting apparently ineffective
companion paper rozin et al present arguments facts substantiate two claims shall not repeat here
they then suggest war obesity could benefit nudges not only heavy efforts investments resources
nudges small cheap easily implementable often hardly noticed changes choice architecture i e manner setting choice set presented do not affect choice set itself yet affect appeal different options
rozin et al 's nudge nobesity very simple if you want increase decrease popularity food item make easier harder access respectively
same spirit present paper explores another possible nudge nobesity
show placing food item menu at beginning end its category increases its popularity compared placing middle
restaurants present customers lists their offerings
when menu displayed writing items presented simultaneously
when waiter recites day's specials items presented sequentially
our study involved only printed menus
menu items may organized various ways type e g soups salads etc
according main ingredients fish dishes vegetarian dishes etc

within each category they typically listed vertical ordering
when designing menus does order matter
one may seek answers two kinds sources-the how literature menu design psychological literature position effects
familiar position effects primacy recency refer stimuli presented sequentially their dependent variable not usually choice
but effect called edge avoidance centrality preferences middle bias center-stage effect refers choice among simultaneously presented options-and various names indicate typical findings people choosing array identical options reliably prefer middle ones
when items not identical effect's manifestation when options presented middle array they chosen more often than when they presented its edges
studies do not course apply options position may inherently important theater airplane seats skyscraper floors restaurant tables place queues
rather they use options hard imagine why position would matter i
number opaque boxes people choose hide seek treasure ii
similarly what position people place guess answers multiple-choice tests iii
good they choose set identical non-identical goods offered iv
what stall they head public bathroom etc
all studies found placing item middle rather than edges choice set enhanced its popularity
aware only three exceptions there seems advantage being first last simultaneously presented choice set rather than its middle
nisbett wilson asked their subjects consider linear array number identical pairs stockings fact their subjects were not aware serendipitously found pronounced left-to-right position effect right-most object array was also last perused was heavily over-chosen p number namely last-is-best
contrast koppell steen analyzed real ballot-voting data was almost like controlled study inasmuch order candidates' names was rotated precinct p number found candidates received greater proportion vote when listed first than when listed any other position p number namely first-is-best
finally christenfeld asked respondents choose route between two points either hypothetical maps real
destination point could not reached walking straight line but paths chosen had same total length number turns
respondents showed preference path reached making first turn late possible
paths cannot classified into first last middle but possible points taking first turn sense respondents preferred last
contrast all above-mentioned findings restaurant trade publications menus advocate both edges namely first last positions where one should place items whose popularity one wants enhance
recommendations however were never backed research none best our knowledge exists panitz's claim certainly valid but not clear why one needs rely much memory when choosing menu
moreover when kincaid corsun attempted put other accepted truths regarding impact menu layout item sales empirical test their title question consultants blowing smoke
p number was answered affirmative
however since they did not study edge bias specifically no direct menu results either contrast add edge avoidance reported above
present study therefore did not hypothesize bias either favor against middle positioned items but rather checked whether one exists using number tailed significance testing
