 
although many models risky choices between gambles assume information somehow integrated recently proposed priority heuristic ph claims choices based one piece information only
although current reason choice according ph vary all other reasons claimed ignored
however choices predicted ph other pieces information often confounded thus rendering critical tests whether decisions actually based one reason only impossible
current study aims remedy problem manipulating number reasons additionally line choice implied ph
results show participants' choices decision times depend heavily number reasons line ph  thus contradicting notion non-compensatory one-reason decision making
 introduction 
adaptive toolbox metaphor put forward gigerenzer co-workers implies decision makers possess use collection simple rules thumb  so-called fast-and-frugal heuristics  achieve very good results very little effort
since was originally formulated toolbox been rapidly growing new heuristics introduced almost regularly
despite broder's criticism inventing more more new heuristics may soon become futile if they not seriously tested empirically p number adaptive toolbox was recently extended preferential decisions means priority heuristic  simple lexicographic rule choices between gambles
although idea adaptive decision making choice itself not novel ph represents new development area
brandstatter et al concluded ph outperforms both normative other heuristic models predicting participants choices
also they claim represents process model choice describing sequence steps taken decision maker's cognitive apparatus
both claims been seriously questioned substantial debates about properties ph more generally plausibility fast-and-frugal-heuristics approach arisen
one serious caveat studies investigating ph lies selection gambles used choice predicted ph gamble favored other pieces information often confounded
thus adherence rates ph modal choices studied brandstatter et al might biased measures whether participants' decisions truly based one reason only claimed ph
current study aims remedy problem
first choice rule ph will introduced along description problem confounded information gamble-pairs
