people function world ignoring most active avoidance reframing adaptation
issue particularly striking professions morticians surgeons sanitation workers there frequent contact major disgust elicitors
study study adaptation process dead bodies disgust elicitors measuring specific types disgust sensitivity medical students before after they spent few months dissecting cadaver
using disgust scale find significant reduction disgust responses death body envelope violation elicitors but no significant change any other specific type disgust
there clear reduction discomfort at touching cold dead body but not touching human body still warm after death
 introduction 
disgust general negative experience people seek avoid terminate
however humans live disgusting world
air breathe comes lungs other people chairs sit were exposed buttocks many others our silverware was mouths many others toilet seat use public bathroom was touched bare buttocks many unknown others money use was handled many other people air contains molecules vaporized animal human feces most molecules water drink were at one point other part urine some once passed through body adolph hitler
yet humans negotiate their daily activities without much concern about disgusting entities
they do so same way they not crippled thoughts their mortality keeping concerns background out consciousness
accomplished number ways number
direct denial suppression disgusting implications number
reframing thinking potentially disgusting things other ways number
adaptation ceasing think many potential disgusts disgusting
example illustrate denial most people when exiting public bathroom do not think about fact metal knob handle door they opening been touched many other unknown people some whom no doubt did not wash their hands
if reminded when undesirable person front them opened door way out bathroom people might take paper towel open door
other hand illustrate adaptation mortician who preparing his hundredth dead body burial certainly attending but ceased presumably adaptation disgusted
finally illustrate reframing one reduce potential disgust about swimming public pool little children no doubt urinate while swimming noting ocean itself low level urine so swimming pool just like smaller instantiation ocean
individuals cope many potential disgust elicitors encountered normal day they may experience disgust only few times day
problem seems most daunting individuals whose professions bring them into contact strong disgust elicitors repeatedly morticians sanitation workers hospital orderlies surgeons example
seems reasonable suppose two different types factors at work reducing disgust responses professions
first individuals who generally less disgust sensitive may more likely choose professions
second coping processes denial reframing adaptation may presumed activated become habitual prepotent
adaptation seems like most likely candidate
study explore number
whether adaptation occurs result extensive exposure particular class disgust elicitors number
insofar adaptation occurs whether specific class elicitors there was exposure
examine questions case first year medical students who spend number  number months dissecting cadaver
