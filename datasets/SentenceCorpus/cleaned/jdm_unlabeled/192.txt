 
perform experimental investigation using dictator game individuals must make moral decision  give not give amount money poor people third world
questionnaire subjects asked about reasons their decision shows at least case moral motivations carry heavy weight decision majority dictators give money reasons consequentialist nature
based results presented here other analogous experiments conclude dicator behavior understood terms moral distance rather than social distance systematically deviates egoism assumption economic models game theory
 introduction 
standard dictator game dg experiments one players dictator given fixed amount money set instructions
instructions explain money been assigned two players  dictator recipient  but only dictator entitled decide how much money keep how much money give recipient
simple situation there at least three sources information relevant decision i information related dictator herself i e whether not decision observed others ii information dictator receives about recipient iii information derived game framing language used instructions
previous papers shown outcome dg changes considerably depending type information provided experimenters
instance when dictator makes decision under conditions absolute privacy anonymity no information about recipient nearly no one donates anything
donations tend very low around number percent pie average
however when dictator receives reliable information regarding recipient even while keeping anonymity constant donations increase
when no information available about recipient dictator may doubts recipient's existence therefore no reason share money
contrast when dictators were shown pictures recipients particular experiment up number percent subjects gave much half total amount although number percent them kept all money themselves
another experiment dictators were told their donation would given red cross
thirty-one percent dictators experiment gave part money number percent gave half amount while number percent gave full amount
offers also increased when dictators were told recipient's surname when they received proof actual existence recipients when they were told recipient was fellow classmate
experiments shown if conditions anonymity relaxed e g dictator's behavior relevant information about recipients revealed donations will higher although full amount money will never donated  exception red cross experiment
language used instructions yet another factor may determine outcome experiment
example fact subjects told they participating experiment may make them lose interest their partner may cause subjects feel they playing game  competition they must therefore win keep all part money themselves
nature payments presence absence experimenters possibility taking part future experiments  thus winning more money  may also determine outcome
aim experiments measure prosocial conduct other-regarding preferences revealed subjects thus challenging assumption self-interested behavior
supposition individuals will attempt maximize their own benefits standard assumption economics could lead conclusion no one will give anything dg since giving nothing behavior maximizes dictator material's payoff
however seen subjects often deviate prediction laboratory setting
light experimental results several hypotheses been developed explain deviations
hoffman et al show anonymity relaxed donations increase
opinion authors due fact anonymity generates social distance they define degree reciprocity subjects believe exists within social interaction
social isolation lack sense community produced anonymity leads predominance self-interested behavior
nonetheless hypothesis social distance been widely criticized
concept reciprocity example employed very broad sense since reality dg does not pose so much problem reciprocity  recipient do nothing one subject identifiability
indeed identifiability determines behavior
many experiments shown not so much degree dictator anonymity determines donations but rather information dictator about recipient
thus example extensive article several hypotheses reviewed explain donations dictator games others proposed bolton et al argue if i know nothing about other person if i give her money i err her favor but i prefer err my favor because i am not saint i'm-no-saint hypothesis
according authors however hypotheses explain dg donations unclear when dictator information about recipient
should noted bolton et al do not find evidence what they call kindness hypothesis according dictators might motivated give gift one more many reasons e g sense moral obligation pleasure derived giving demonstrate kindness number
hypothesis however encompasses very distinct motivations must analyzed separately
although pleasures giving demonstrating kindness greatly affected anonymity  recipient not knowing if dictator gives not takes away pleasure giving does not allow dictator demonstrate she kind  moral obligation not affected anonymity but rather lack information about recipient's actual situation
classic hoffman et al experiment most experiments along lines complete lack information about recipient removes necessary conditions donate out sense moral obligation if eckel grossman shown altruistic behavior requires appropriate context inexistent most experiments what would happen if dictator makes decision easily recognizable moral context context dictators information example about their partner's poverty illness
eckel grossman's experiment partner red cross donations increase but not spectacular way
donations increase much more when money dictator distribute result joint effort both dictator partner given case social pressures moral imperatives warm glow giving likely magnify reward skillful deserving recipients
ruffle points out results experiment contradict hoffman et al 's claim other-regarding preferences do expectations phenomenon not autonomous private preference equity
moral preferences sense moral obligation moral imperatives equity appear repeatedly discussions outcomes diverse range dg experiments
yet spite fact donations occur experiments cannot speak any certainty about dictators' reasons giving only thing know sure preference been revealed decision whether dictator gave did not give
indeed aside theoretical speculations experimenters do not know why dictators give
view bridging gap following section present two experiments hypothetical one real-payoffs one moral context easily recognizable dictators expressly asked about reasons their action
then determine if kindness hypothesis some degree certain either because dictators take pleasure giving give demonstrate kindness give out sense moral obligation
