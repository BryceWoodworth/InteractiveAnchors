 
purpose present study was investigate effect perceived time pressure learning-based task called iowa gambling task igt
one hundred sixty-three participants were randomly assigned one two groups
experimental group was informed time allotted was typically insufficient learn successfully complete task
control group was informed time allotted was typically sufficient learn successfully complete task
both groups completed igt performance was recorded
major finding was participants who were advised amount time allotted was typically insufficient complete task performed significantly worse than those who were advised time was typically sufficient complete task
 introduction 
research shows real time constraints adversely influence igt performance
there remains need however determine how perceived time pressure affects igt decision-making
essence igt performance impaired real time constraints simply perception time constraints
