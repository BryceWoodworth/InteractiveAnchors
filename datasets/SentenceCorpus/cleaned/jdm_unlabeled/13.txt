 introduction 
some use sometimes
short statement newell concluded empirical research well-known take-the-best heuristic ttb
fast frugal heuristic was introduced gigerenzer hoffrage kleinbolting gigerenzer goldstein provide alternative traditionally proposed strategies judgment decision making research
according traditional models rational decision requires comprehensive integration all available information about all alternatives
integration become computationally complex soon information cues probabilistic numerous
gigerenzer goldstein however were able show simulation binary attribute cue paradigm choosing best alternative out two very simple when searching available cues sequential order descending validity probability cue will lead correct decision given discriminates between alternatives deciding direction first discriminating cue
stimulus environment they used german cities their population size number features being present cities not simple three-step-heuristic containing search rule stopping rule decision rule led decisions same quality comprehensive computational integration entire set cue information
termination information search after having found first discriminating cue therefore been called one-reason decision making ordm
term ordm was chosen clear contrast models stand integration all available information usually not reflecting how information was compiled
models varying complexity ranging simple tallying complex multiple linear regression
what they common at least two pieces information need present starting comparison case several cues indicating same option integration available information
contrast class ordm subsume broad class under term more-reason decision making mrdm because search more than one discriminating piece information prerequisite information integration
ttb most prominent representative ordm reveals impressively high number correct predictions compared mrdm models
mathematical results allow ttb rank amongst rational strategies used probabilistic decision making especially but not only when information needs searched
however empirical findings concerning use ttb  compared mrdm models  were heterogeneous
while conclusions some studies were generally against use ttb because they found only particular use strategy survey more recent studies shows more evidence use ttb
one unresolved question fact participants repeatedly showed huge inter intra-individual inconsistency using single strategy
so far there been no statistical environments all participants experiment acted according ttb refrained using
but what even more problematic inconsistent use ordm stopping rule
most surprising effect was reported newell weston shanks testing sequential search paradigm using only two available cues they found number participants number percent their sample continuing information search some instances even when more valid cue discriminated hence completely ignoring fact second cue would not able compensate first information
