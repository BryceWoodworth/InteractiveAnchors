present research suggests answer depends rate consumption
three experiments find whereas variety stimuli preferred repetition even better-liked single stimulus when consumption continuous preference reverses when satiation associated repetition reduced slowing down rate consumption
decision makers however seem under-appreciate influence consumption rate preference satisfaction variety
at high rates consumption they correctly anticipate their own high desire variety but at low rates consumption people tend overestimate their own desire variety
results complicate picture presented prior research diversification bias suggesting people overestimate their own desire variety only when consumption spaced out over time
 introduction 
dictum variety spice life notwithstanding people seem show surprising tolerance even preference repetition
whether favorite snack pop song piece art people routinely expose themselves same liked stimulus repeatedly
indeed prior work shown people even surprise themselves preference research diversification bias consistently shown people predict greater preference variety aversion repetition than they show their online immediate preferences
example when shopping week's supply yogurt person might supplement his her favorite flavor say strawberry one more less preferred alternatives say vanilla only find surplus less preferred flavor at end week
apparent tolerance repetition conflicts not only people's own intuitions but surface at least existing models taste satiation
central tenet most psychological economic theories taste enjoyment enjoyable stimuli declines repetition
if people repeatedly consume product thought they become satiated-and enjoyment decreases
indeed one illustrative study participants listened number second sample favorite song number times quick succession rating their enjoyment experience along way
what began enjoyable experience became decidedly less so after only number iteration
how seeming inconsistencies-the revealed preference repetition shown studies diversification bias aversion repetition shown studies like above-be reconciled
one key discrepancy may lie inter-consumption interval time between acts consumption
whereas studies demonstrate preference repetition tend involve brief episodes consumption relatively long day week inter-consumption interval song study just described involved more prolonged consumption experience no breaks between individual acts consumption
difference likely critical importance light inherently fleeting nature satiation
although people do satiate given stimulus satiation tends relatively short-lived
time people's preferences typically return their pre-consumption level
just muscle weakens short-term through repeated use but replenishes over time satiation seems same property
whereas same snack pop song grows tiresome if repeated quick succession drop-off enjoyment may much smaller even non-existent if there sufficient gap between consumption intervals
if rate consumption influences desirability repetition logically follows should influence desirability its logical complement-variety-as well
people aware influence rate consumption satiation
informal observation suggests they
most us realize same favorite food would quickly grow tiresome if served appetizer entree dessert at same sitting-whereas those same three servings would perfectly palatable if spread out over month
yet research seems show people consistently underestimate their liking repetition overestimate their liking its complement variety at least when consumption spaced
why
one reason time contraction
people tend underweight importance time when predicting their preferences novelty liking repetition imagining lengthy intervals if they were short ones
when predicting their snack preferences over course week instance people think about how unappetizing same food item would if consumed rapid succession forgetting time tends reset one's preferences
consistent time contraction read loewenstein showed merely drawing people's attention otherwise neglected inter-consumption interval decreased predicted instance inaccurate preference variety
note however time contraction explanation unwarranted preference applies only lengthy inter-consumption intervals
extent people underestimate their liking repetition because they imagine short inter-consumption interval those predictions should more calibrated when inter-consumption interval fact short
other words inter-consumption interval decreases predicted preference variety should align in-experience thus actual preferences
straightforward prediction naturally follows hypothesis concerning people's satisfaction choices they make advance
already mentioned prior work diversification bias consistently shown people choose greater variety when deciding future consumption than when deciding moment
should come no surprise then people sometimes dissatisfied degree variety they select prospectively
however if our thesis correct then miswanting also likely vary function inter-consumption interval
specifically inter-consumption interval decreases satisfaction choices made advance should increase
present research was designed test hypotheses
experiment number explores whether enjoyment repetition aversion variety increases inter-consumption interval increases
experiment number examines whether tendency choose more variety prospect than moment-the diversification bias-decreases inter-consumption interval decreases
experiment number also examines whether causes people more satisfied consumption choices they make advance inter-consumption interval decreases
experiment number extends results varying length inter-consumption interval observing nature relationship between interval preference variety subsequent enjoyment
