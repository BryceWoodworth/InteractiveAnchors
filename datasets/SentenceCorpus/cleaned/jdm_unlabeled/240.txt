 
recent research suggesting people who maximize less happy than those who satisfice received considerable fanfare
current study investigates whether conclusion reflects construct itself rather how measured
developed alternative measure maximizing tendency theory-based good psychometric properties predicts behavioral outcomes
contrast existing maximization measure our new measure did not correlate life dissatisfaction nor most maladaptive personality decision-making traits
conclude interpretation maximizers unhappy may due poor measurement construct
present more reliable valid measure future researchers use
 introduction 
term satisfice was coined herbert simon describe decision-making strategy strives adequacy rather than optimality
people generally satisfice according simon because they not wits maximize p number
more recently tendency satisfice maximize been conceptualized individual difference trait
schwartz his colleagues developed maximization scale contains number self-report items aimed at assessing general tendency seek optimality e g i treat relationships like clothing i expect try lot before i get perfect fit

low scores measure intended reflect general tendency satisfice
findings based use scale appeared top academic journals inferences drawn about maximizers been reported major media best-selling book
general maximizers characterized unhappy group people debilitated unrealistically high expectations face excess options
given strong inferences been drawn about mental well-being maximizers versus satisficers  based responses maximization scale  especially important confidence construct validity measure
highhouse diab suggested maximization scale falls short commonly accepted psychometric standards
purpose present research therefore was better understand nature construct measured maximization scale propose alternative measure maximization construct
