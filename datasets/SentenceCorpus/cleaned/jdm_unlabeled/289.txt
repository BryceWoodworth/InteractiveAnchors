 
recent years numerous studies comparing intuition deliberation been published
however relatively little known about cognitive processes underlying two decision modes
two studies analyzed effects decision mode instructions processes information search integration using eye-tracking technology between-participants study number within-participants study number design
our findings indicate instruction deliberate does not necessarily lead qualitatively different information processing compared instruction decide intuitively
found no difference mean fixation duration distribution short medium long fixations
short fixations particular prevailed under both decision mode instructions while long fixations indicating conscious calculation-based information processing were rarely observed
instruction-induced deliberation led higher number fixations more complete information search more repeated information inspections
interpret our findings support hypothesis intuitive deliberate decision modes share same basic processes supplemented additional operations deliberate decision mode
 introduction 
according commonly-held assumptions individuals sometimes make decisions deliberately sometimes rely their intuition gut feeling
although distinction between two types information processing now widely accepted judgment decision making jdm research relatively little known about cognitive affective processes underlie them
different models rely automatic processes might considered account intuition see glockner witteman press overview
models range mainly cognitive evidence accumulation sampling network models more affect-based approaches
furthermore many theories concern interplay between intuitive deliberate processes
long tradition dual-process models postulates clear distinction between intuition deliberation
kahneman frederick pointed out dual-process models come many flavors but all distinguish cognitive operations quick associative others slow rule-governed
despite apparent consensus regarding basic properties intuition deliberation dual-process framework been criticized being not sufficiently specified
second crucial critique concerns fact evidence dual-process theories predominantly based outcome measures while cognitive processes underlying intuition deliberation were mainly neglected
furthermore theorizing dual-process theories inconsistent wealth models hard summarize according simple criteria
one suggestion categorizing dual-process models into three classes according interplay two decision modes was made evans
first class so-called pre-emptive theories characterized initial selection between two rather distinct kinds processes
instance mode selection models might subsumed under class
second class theories denoted parallel-competitive postulates parallel activation both processing modes kind competition among them might result conflicting responses
assumption most strongly advocated sloman other authors hold view well present consistent evidence
third class theories so-called default-interventionist models state intuitive processes always activated first default mode deliberate processes may intervene upon intuitive processes
evans instance assumes heuristic processes generate default responses analytic processes might intervene scrutinize potentially correct initial response
similar vein network models argue automatic processes build basis every decision only supplemented deliberate processes if necessary
number hammond hamm grassia pearson had already suggested intuition deliberation not completely distinct categories cognitive processes between people switch
rather they seen poles cognitive continuum task factors influence how far one moves toward one other pole
present paper used eye-tracking technology analyze fine-grained level how instruction decide intuitively deliberately affects information search integration
specifically tested whether decision mode instructions induce qualitatively different information integration processes
try relate at first glance methodological question theoretical issue dual-processing models namely whether reasonable assume intuition deliberation distinct whether both might rely similar basic processes just supplemented additional processing steps
proceed follows first discuss dual-process theories special focus whether they postulate more distinct more integrated processes
second describe probabilistic inference tasks discuss related cue-weighting schemes
third introduce core eye-tracking measure single fixation duration used investigate qualitative differences information processing
fourth derive hypotheses both distinct integrated processes perspective
