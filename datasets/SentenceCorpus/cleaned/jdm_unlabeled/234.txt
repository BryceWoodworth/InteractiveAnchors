 
anticipated regret important determinant risky decision making however only few studies explored its role problem gambling
study tested differences anticipation regret among social problem gamblers examined how differences affect risk preferences gambling task
extent problem gambling was assessed using south oaks gambling screen participants were randomly assigned one two conditions
risky feedback condition feeling regret was avoided choosing risky gamble whereas safe feedback condition safe gamble was regret-minimizing option
problem gambling was associated choice risky gamble both conditions indicating less sensitivity anticipated regret
was also associated risk seeking across feedback conditions when stakes winning loosing were higher
findings suggest less regret poor anticipation regret might contribute excessive gambling thus need addressed cognitive treatments problem gambling
 introduction 
cognitive distortions been identified research literature key contributing factor instigation maintenance problem gambling
numerous studies shown gamblers hold irrational beliefs suffer cognitive biases illusion control gambler's fallacy attribution bias lead inaccurate inferences about outcome probabilities
resulting overestimation chances win underestimation possible losses propel individuals place more risky bets encourage persistent gambling
besides erroneous beliefs about probabilities gambling persistence risk taking may also affected anticipation emotions associated gambling outcomes
role anticipated emotions well documented literature decision making anticipated regret receiving particular attention
however relatively few studies examined anticipated regret context gambling
wolfson briggs investigated intentions number lottery players participate newly introduced lottery united kingdom found number percent were willing purchase tickets because they anticipated feeling regret if their numbers came up
share increased number percent those who played regularly same set numbers
comprehensive study dutch postcode lottery zeelenberg pieters showed regret people expected feel if they decided not play discovered their neighbor had won significantly contributed their intention participate lottery near future
rae haw assessed effects anticipated regret disappointment elation persistence gambling number gamblers found anticipated emotions did not predict gambling persistence
although all three studies examine relationship between anticipated regret gambling their results do not allow draw conclusions about clinical implications regret excessive gambling
due fact none studies screened participants gambling problems making impossible assess how many them actually met criteria problem pathological gamblers
present study examined role anticipated regret problem gambling focusing two issues
first estimated effect gambling preference anticipation regret
previous research suggested although erroneous beliefs distorted cognitions common among all types gamblers pathological gamblers seem suffer more cognitive illusions endorse more irrational beliefs more convinced their irrational beliefs than social gamblers
recent study tochkov showed high-frequency gamblers were less able anticipate regret than low-frequency gamblers indicating inaccurately anticipated regret possible contributing factor persistent gambling
participants were asked choose gambles fictitious monetary outcomes imagine how they would feel once they learn outcome their decision
week later same participants were asked play same gambles real actual monetary wins losses rate their regret
tochkov reported difference between anticipated actual regret was significantly larger high-frequency gamblers compared low-frequency gamblers
findings suggest when gamblers do not anticipate negative feelings regret they might experience once they learn outcome their bet they more tempted continue gambling
contrast anticipation regret about gambling outcomes could serve natural inhibitor continuous gambling
line reasoning supported evidence number studies found anticipation regret decreases intentions engaging risky potentially addictive behaviors
recent study fernandez-duque landers showed individuals experienced more regret than they had anticipated turn made them more risk averse subsequent gambling task
present study explores relationship between anticipation regret gambling preferences giving gamblers choice between two gambles one promised reveal outcome selected option only partial feedback other outcome both selected rejected options complete feedback
was hypothesized stronger gambling preference would adversely associated regret anticipation would thus result more frequent choice gamble partial feedback
second goal study was assess effect gambling preferences risk attitudes
previous studies demonstrated problem gamblers exhibit higher degrees risk taking than normal subjects because they suffer cognitive biases make risky bets more attractive because they feel overconfident their skills
accordingly was hypothesized risk attitude associated stronger gambling preference would skewed towards risk seeking due lower levels regret anticipation
following zeelenberg et al two experimental conditions were created each contained partial complete feedback option
risky feedback condition partial feedback was associated risky gamble whereas safe feedback condition regret-minimizing option was safe gamble
i hypothesized weaker gambling preference would trigger regret avoidance thus preference partial feedback would lead risk seeking risk aversion depending feedback condition
contrast stronger gambling preference would related risk seeking regardless expected feedback
moreover i examined risk preferences gambles low high variation outcome probabilities test robustness results respect different stakes involved winning losing
