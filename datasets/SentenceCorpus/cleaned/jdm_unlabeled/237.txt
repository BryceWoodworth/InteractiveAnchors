 
humans other animals idiosyncratically sensitive risk either preferring avoiding options having same value but differing uncertainty
many explanations risk sensitivity rely non-linear shape hypothesized utility curve
because models do not place any importance uncertainty per se utility curve-based accounts predict indifference between risky riskless options offer same distribution rewards
here show monkeys strongly prefer uncertain gambles alternating rewards same payoffs demonstrating uncertainty itself contributes appeal risky options
based prior observations hypothesized appeal risky option enhanced salience potential jackpot
test subtly manipulated payoffs second gambling task
found monkeys more sensitive small changes size large reward than equivalent changes size small reward indicating they attend preferentially jackpots
together results challenge utility curve-based accounts risk sensitivity suggest psychological factors outcome salience uncertainty itself contribute risky decision-making
 introduction 
millions people regularly play lottery despite fact tickets typically expected value less than half their price
traditionally economic models explain preferences shape utility curve
utility curve hypothetical construct linking observable values outcomes onto subjective internal values
because decision makers exhibit diminishing marginal utilities most contexts average utility large small outcome hypothesized less than utility middle-sized outcome
consequently decision makers should risk-averse situations
conversely contexts marginal utilities convex should promote risk-seeking
fact lottery advertisements focus specific benefits winning suggests drawing attention possible jackpot influence decision gamble
indeed several reports suggested relative salience different outcomes risky situation may influence way gamble whole evaluated
outcomes more vivid easier remember more emotional often seen more likely  idea known availability heuristic economics
similar vein several studies suggested feelings about possible outcomes influence appeal gamble
consistent ideas hypothesized value placed risky option reflects part outcome competition between possibilities favorable unfavorable outcomes competition biased towards more salient possible outcome
use term salience indicate attentional weighting possibility decision-making
however biasing may stronger presence uncertainty when options certain biasing may less likely occur
when decision-maker considers whether gamble he she compares value safe option biased valuation risky option
performed two behavioral experiments rhesus monkeys test idea risk sensitivity reflects outcome salience outcome uncertainty itself rather than just nonlinear weighting reward outcomes
both experiments employed variants gambling task developed our lab monkeys reliably risk-seeking
first compared monkeys' preferences risky predictably alternating options over time both offered equal mix large small rewards
alternating option provided identical sets outcomes therefore identical utilities monkeys so any preference between options cannot reflect utility weighting
found monkeys strongly preferred risky option alternating one demonstrating uncertainty risky option part its appeal
also hypothesized risk-seeking observed reflects at least part salience large rewards
if monkeys preferentially attend larger outcome they should more sensitive small changes its size
therefore examined monkeys' sensitivity incremental changes sizes large small outcomes second experiment
predicted found monkeys were sensitive variations size large reward but not equivalent changes size small reward
