judging near distant virtue vice
journal experimental social psychology number number  number explored how psychological distance influences moral judgment found more extreme moral appraisals were given distal behaviors rather than proximal behaviors
contrary eyal et al current paper presents converging evidence showing moral judgments become more extreme at lower-level construals compared higher-level construals
four experiments using two different priming techniques manipulated construal levels assessed their effects moral judgment
high-level consturals elicited less moral outrage toward transgressions less positive ratings virtuous behaviors than low-level construals
replication study was also conducted reconcile inconsistencies between current results those eyal et al possible explanations different results between two studies discussed
 introduction 
preference judgment commonly influenced information attend receive construct
construe same event different ways
when attending object focus its entire figure focus its details
recent work construal level theory clt provides framework considerable potential linking mental representations moral judgment
clt proposes same event object represented at multiple levels abstraction
high-level construals superordinate decontextualized entail constructing conceptualizations information about objects events
contrast low-level construals consist subordinate contextualized information represented concretely detail
individuals' judgments decisions behaviors differ function construal levels
more weight given global features at high-level construals whereas local concrete features more influential at low-level construals
clt received great deal attention psychology its predictions been applied many aspects human cognition behavior
example activation high-level construals leads categorization fewer broader units whereas activation low levels leads categorization multiple narrow concrete units
high-level representations also more coherent integrative whereas low-level representations more specific disparate
according clt psychological distance major determinant what level construal activated
general distancing target any dimension psychological distance i e time space social hypotheticality leads greater activation high-level construals than low-level construals
instance fujita colleagues found subjects were more likely describe spatially distant events terms goals high-level than terms means low-level
under framework clt eyal et al investigated how psychological distance affects moral judgment
paper they argued moral principles high-level constructs because their universal nature concrete situational detail should mitigate moral judgment
since clt posits more psychologically distant entities represented at higher-level construals eyal et al proposed people would more inclined base their judgments remote behaviors moral principles but underweight situational details thereby leading more extreme moral judgments distal transgressions relative proximal transgressions
consider instance act sexual intercourse between siblings
distant perspective one tends construe incest without considering mitigating details e g using contraceptives might tilt moral judgment less extreme
therefore eyal et al predicted observed greater psychological distances were associated more extreme moral judgments
current project tried build eyal et al findings started conceptual replication more directly manipulating construal levels
clt indicates findings effect psychological distance people's judgment decision making should not unique effect psychological distance per se but rather more general process mental representations influence nature evaluative objects decisions
considering eyal et al studies manipulated psychological distances did not test proposed effects construal levels first used more direct manipulation construal levels manipulation employed other clt research investigate how levels construal affect moral judgment
however observed low-level construals led more negative judgment moral transgressions contrary eyal et al 's findings interpretation
order establish robustness our findings conducted another three experiments using different manipulations construal levels varied scenarios
consistent initial findings converging results suggest moral judgments more extreme at lower-level construals than higher-level construals
given our results opposite those eyal et al established partial collaboration tal eyal attempting understand basis our differing pattern findings
conducted replication study study number present paper still observed results contrary those eyal et al tal eyal also tried replicate two our experiments israeli subjects partial results were direction replicating our findings but not statistically reliable
