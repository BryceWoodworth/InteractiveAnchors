sellers may course make declaration quality but unless there sanctions imposed false declarations reputations at stake declarations tantamount cheap talk
nonetheless experimental study find most people make honest declarations line recent findings lies damaging another party costly terms liar's utility
moreover find experimental market deceptive sellers offer lower prices than honest sellers could possibly explained same wish limit damage other party
however when recipient offer social tie find no evidence lower prices deceptive offers seems indicate rationale lower price deceptive offers strangers fact profit-seeking making deal more attractive rather than moral
 introduction 
market said asymmetric information if only sellers know quality goods
george akerlof's famous game-theoretic paper market lemons showed given certain conditions good quality would driven out markets information asymmetries
experimental studies support basic argument
core features traditional market-for-lemons model quality prices goods
high quality goods assumed more valuable sellers buyers alike but only sellers know quality at time sale
order any deception take place sellers must also able make quality declaration true false
if no reputation-building other sanctions possible declarations considered cheap talk usually discarded irrelevant game theory
effect standard game theory everyone supposed lie if they benefit doing so
archetypical example market-for-lemons market used cars
however uri gneezy points out empirical departure theoretical prediction he then suggests buyers often place sufficient trust private sellers' honesty because many private sellers actually prefer honest
indeed many experimental studies found most subjects usually do not take advantage possibility deceive another party
studies also identify several moderators decision whether deceive particular gneezy found deception less likely occur more damages other party
will think moral cost deception
here present novel experimental study deception price market lemons
far know there been no previous study deceptive declarations quality markets
our first aim establish also context most subjects will tend honest
said differently expect most subjects who advertise peach will actually sell peach not lemon
our second main aim study relationship between deception pricing
market where sellers set prices no gain made deception unless seller actually charges more good when buyer believes high quality
pricing aspect no counterpart gneezy's study where subjects only chose whether honest deceive
our experiment gadget sellers compete buyers both declared quality price
at first glance may seem unreasonable honest deceptive sellers deviate price they offer since gadgets indistinguishable buyers at time purchase
however will discuss immediately below there several reasons why deceptive sellers might charge less
terminology wolinsky higher price signals higher quality
hence our second question whether sellers our market employ price signaling
why would deceptive sellers charge less
following gneezy liars concerned damage their deception causes buyers might want compensate offering lower price let us call mechanism moral price signaling
alternative mechanism rational price signaling profit-maximizing sellers who believe most buyers prefer buy lower-priced goods would actually charge less when deceptive than when honest
reason possibility higher price relatively less attractive seller who does not bear cost parting high quality
difficult distinguish between two mechanisms within same market framework
our approach let sellers make offers both strangers friends
rationale comes research sociology social psychology showing information asymmetries lead strong preferences socially embedded transactions part buyers since friends more trusted behave honestly
therefore seller who gives offer friend regardless price relatively certain offer will not rejected out distrust
consequently rational price signaling would not expected between friends whereas moral price signaling would if anything more accentuated between friends
our third question thus whether price signaling dependent whether offers made social ties strangers
cross-national experiment outlined section follow was designed answer questions
collected data sellers well buyers
latter data allow us investigate buyers' preferences over prices social embeddedness
particular want ascertain buyers tend prefer lower priced offers unless offer friend
