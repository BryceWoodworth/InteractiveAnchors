 introduction 
at least since end second world war economic foreign policy decision-making been dominated rational actor perspective assumes decision-makers model world basis rational choice cost-benefit calculations commensurable across cultures
although well accepted decision makers often fail make normatively rational choices assumption they nonetheless seeking maximize utility dominates
example makeup performance principal forums u s policy leaves little doubt policy decisions should result instrumental choices goal-oriented political economic actors
official national security strategy united states explicitly states commitment results-oriented planning focuses actions results rather than rule-making
recent work protected sacred values challenged presumption issues under dispute inter-group conflicts fungible valued along common scale
new body research emphasized protagonists disputes often invest values transcendental qualities affect decision-making
example large scale study israelis palestinians ginges atran medin shikaki presented subjects peace deals involving mutual compromises over core issues future jerusalem experimentally varied incentives compromise within each deal
sharp contrast rational actor perspective subjects who viewed issues under dispute sacred values responded greater outrage deals added material incentives compromise those values
material incentives compromise backfired presumably because they made salient taboo against measuring commitment sacred values along instrumental metrics
however paradoxical effect held only people who treated issue sacred value not those who saw values important but not sacred
existing empirical work sacred values been focused predominantly conflicts embedded complex historical contexts often marking life identity several generations dealing issues sovereignty over jerusalem gaza west bank conflict over babri mosque india centuries old sharia law indonesia
yet seems possible issues much narrower historical context become sacred values especially when they involve identity-related issues sovereignty
research reported here investigate whether values would also lead judgments decisions would not instrumentally rational
specifically focus iran's stance its national nuclear program using test bed emerging sacred values
past few years iranian government actively defended its right having nuclear program part framing dispute analogues past historical events advancement iranian nation was interrupted foreign powers
specifically iranian government made conscious effort link proliferation issue struggle nationalization oil half century ago struggle continues strongly resonate iranian people
drawing parallels between events nuclear dispute essentially framed ongoing resistance deep historical context
consequently iranian government vigorously defended its inalienable rights having program at recent news conference iran's foreign minister motakki argued cannot any compromise respect iranian nation's inalienable right acquire nuclear capability
while public discourse west about iranian nuclear program focused risks costs benefits iranian position they will not retreat one iota will 'never ever' compromise nuclear dispute mainly domain sacred rhetoric
investigated whether iranians who treat iranian nuclear program sacred value would amenable material incentives compromise
u s its allies including u k france currently contemplating material sanctions bite
critical therefore know what possible reactions iranians sanctions may
