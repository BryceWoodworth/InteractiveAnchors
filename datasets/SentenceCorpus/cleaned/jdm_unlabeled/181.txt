data three distinct cultural groups adults drawn respectively u s n number western europe n number china n number were analyzed
results showed societies where choice abundant i e u s western europe maximizers reported less well-being than satisficers difference was mediated experienced regret

although china maximizing was associated more experiences regret regret had no substantial relationship well-being
patterns also emerged individual facets maximizing scale although notable difference between u s europe high standards facet
argued societies where abundant individual choice highly valued considered ultimate route personal happiness maximizers' dissatisfaction regret over imperfect choices detrimental factor well-being whereas much less crucial determinant well-being societies place less emphasis choice way happiness
 introduction 
autonomy choice individual decision making highly valued western societies
greater choice provide two types benefits
first enable choosers find exactly what they want
secondly enhance their feeling autonomy freedom
nonetheless various studies recently cautioned unlimited choice may come at price does not always benefit mental health well-being
regard schwartz argued options added within domain choice several problems may materialize
first process collecting adequate complete information about options makes choosing more laborious
second options expand people's standards what acceptable outcome rise
thirdly people may come believe any imperfect result their fault because so many options they no excuse not getting right one
ironically however more options there more likely becomes one does not choose best option
problems become especially relevant contemporary western societies where people overwhelmed near-unlimited options all domains life
regard bellah madsen sullivan swinder tipton already argued people western societies feel increasingly uneasy about their life decisions because they unsure about whether they making right choices according schwartz excess freedom p number resulted dramatic increase people's dissatisfaction their lives even clinical depression
however not everybody may equally sensitive problems come exposure abundance choice
been argued people who always want maximize outcomes their choices most vulnerable negative effects too much choice
people excess options becomes problematic because make sure they choose optimal option all information about each alternative considered often difficult even impossible
moreover there likely lingering doubt best option nevertheless been missed especially when not been possible consider all options
hence potential regret ever present because there always possibility there better option out there failing find means failure optimize personal satisfaction
other hand people approach choices differently using good enough strategy any option meets certain threshold acceptability considered satisfactory
approach choice individual does not consider all information about each option standards what acceptable more modest meaning several options satisfactory standards do not depend number options because adding more options does not suddenly render good option unacceptable
moreover there no failure choosing merely decent but not perfect option when adopting good enough approach choice
importantly schwartz et al found considerable stable individual differences people's dispositional tendency use either good enough strategy maximizing strategy
people either side dispositional continuum been labeled satisficers maximizers respectively latter group expected more vulnerable problems arise excess choice
indeed various studies showed maximizers experience higher levels regret compared satisficers they show lower levels satisfaction decisions lower levels well-being more generally
