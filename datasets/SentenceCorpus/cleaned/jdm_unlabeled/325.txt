after brief introduction first describe classic process tracing methods thinking aloud mouselab eye-tracking
then present series examples how each techniques made important contributions development testing process models jdm

finally argue importance formulating process hypotheses opt multi-method approach focuses cross-validation findings
 introduction 
theories judgment decision making jdm classified into two general types formal as-if models specify relationships between input task context parameters output jdm behavior process models addition seek model explanatory psychological mechanisms underlying input-output relationships
within formal modelling tradition theories evaluated via analysis their predictions concerning outcome judgments decisions subsequent rigorous experimental tests predictions
alternative models evaluated terms testable predictions distinguish them
process models other hand tested evaluated terms both jdm behavior process tracing methods elicit analyze observations range verbal nonverbal antecedents concomitants judgments decisions
imagine you conduct risky decision making experiment you observe choices collect verbal protocols
you find choices conform say prospect theory but verbal protocol only infrequent uses what you coded evidence prospect theory e g reference point setting coding gains losses probability
what would you conclude decision making conforms prospect theory according choices fails do so according verbal protocols
surmise protocols would seen subordinate supplementary source data case
they would tend dismissed if inconsistent choice output
other words would hardly likely reject prospect theory basis verbal protocols any other process data
process data somehow seem subordinate source evidence
models aim at predicting outcomes as-if-models appropriate but not models aim explain both outcome process process models
priority output data based natural sequence testing dependent variables predicting choice data first criterion any model process model as-if-model
but beyond first step there no reason prefer outcome over process
rather process models process data should equally important because they richer than input-output data provide important evidence explanatory mechanisms
instructive example work glockner herbold who show although prospect theory certainly good as-if-model its process assumptions rejected favor alternative models
paper describe methods devised field judgment decision making jdm enable recording traces underlying processes cognitive representations
will describe methods three dimensions their theoretical contribution their core methodology their key results
