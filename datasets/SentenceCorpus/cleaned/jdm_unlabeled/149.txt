 introduction 
mathematics skills among most influential educational factors contributing economic prosperity industrialized countries
accordingly there been considerable interest causes consequences numeracy refers specifically mathematical quantitative literacy
more basic levels numeracy concerned real number line time measurement estimation whereas higher levels focus understanding ratio concepts notably fractions proportions percentages probabilities
much research numeracy involved assessment wide range mathematical skills among large diverse samples
more recently however research theory decision sciences focused subset numeracy important informed accurate risky decision making-i e statistical numeracy
paper use statistical numeracy specifically refer understanding operations probabilistic statistical computation comparing transforming probabilities proportions
statistical aspects numeracy key features risk assessment business engineering play central roles health risk quantification communication
moreover-although risk commonly refers many topics economic psychological theory long held decision making under risk involving known statistical probabilities quantitative probabilistic reasoning
ways others statistical numeracy one factor gives rise risk literacy-i e ability accurately interpret act information about risk
indeed statistical numeracy been shown predictor decision strategies affective reactions comprehension normative choices across many risky economic health consumer decisions
efforts measure individual differences statistical numeracy risk literacy come primarily three forms
some research examines risky decisions relation individual differences overall educational attainment cognitive abilities cognitive styles
other research primarily focusing clinical health domains developed valid subjective instrument self-reported estimations numeracy
most common however use objective performance measures numeracy-i e psychometric tests
paper review development most widely used statistical numeracy instruments examining successes psychometric limits
then introduce new test statistical numeracy risk literacy-i e berlin numeracy test
berlin numeracy test used multiple formats i e computer adaptive paper-and-pencil multiple choice single-item median-split providing fast valid reliable tool research assessment public outreach
specifically show new test offers unique predictive validity comprehension everyday risks beyond other cognitive ability numeracy tests e g cognitive reflection working memory span fluid intelligence
furthermore show berlin numeracy test dramatically improves psychometric discriminability among highly-educated individuals e g college students graduates medical professionals across diverse cultures different languages
close discussion construct validity underlying mechanisms applications e g custom-tailored interactive adaptive risk communication
