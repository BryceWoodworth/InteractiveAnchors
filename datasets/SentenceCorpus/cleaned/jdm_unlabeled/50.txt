 
most american respondents give irrational magical responses variety situations exemplify sympathetic magical laws similarity contagion
most cases respondents aware their responses usually rejections fudge crafted look like dog feces food touched sterilized dead cockroach not scientifically justified but they willing avow them
interpret some sense heart over head
report study american adults undergraduates substantially less likely acknowledge magical effects when judgments involve money amount willing pay avoid unpleasant magical contact than they when using preference rating measures
conclude head-heart conflicts type money tips balance towards former other words money makes mind less magical
 introduction 
sympathetic magical thinking recognizably irrational most educated adults who show effects
participants often laugh at themselves almost apologize face-to-face studies they acknowledge reluctance engage activities eating piece chocolate shaped look like dog feces drinking apple juice brand new bed pan wearing sweater had been previously worn someone aids after was sterilized heat drinking glass juice had previously been touched dead sterilized cockroach
other situations exemplifications two laws sympathetic magic first described anthropologists around turn number th century
two relevant laws contagion once contact always contact similarity like causes like appearance equals reality
different weaker form law similarity involves simple association
if two entities associated one negative properties then second may take some properties
example object owned but never touched disliked person may take negative properties
some cases applicability similarity association principles overlaps
consider person who feels bad about wearing new sweater words convicted murderer written label inside neck rim
could explained simply association between sweater negative connotations murderer similarity appearance reality words convicted murderer stand real thing person actually might owned worn sweater
majority undergraduate other participants surprisingly willing acknowledge their feelings discomfort wide range magical scenarios
although embarrassment would thought work against admissions participants seem sense peculiar domain they license display their feelings
among studies done combination expressed magical thinking overcoming embarrassment most clear cyanide studies
participants observed sugar commercial package was poured into two clean bottles
they were then given two labels one saying sugar other saying sodium cyanide poison asked place one label each bottle they chose
most participants subsequently showed more reluctance drink sugar water made bottle they had labeled cyanide even not sodium cyanide label
suspect willingness show rather silly if genuine response would curbed if stakes were higher example if money were at stake
one might willing acknowledge silly magical feeling but not put money behind
studies described paper test idea questionnaire format
identical magical scenarios described respondents indicate between-subject design their feelings willingness pay avoid interaction magically degraded object
also include data set same respondents make both types judgments at different periods time two months apart
