researchers rely estimates using relative frequencies computed aggregating data over observations
show approach creates conceptual problems may result confounding explanatory variables unstable estimates
circumvent problems propose using probability estimates obtained statistical models-specifically mixed models binary data-in analysis calibration
illustrate methodology re-analyzing data published study comparing results approach those based relative frequencies
model-based estimates avoid problems confounding variables provided more precise estimates resulting better inferences
 introduction 
there substantial literature about quality probability confidence judgments
specific property probability judgments-their calibration-has been accepted common standard validity empirical literature
judgments said calibrated if p number percent all events assigned subjective probability p materialize
paper focuses some conceptual methodological problems associated standard calibration analyses
