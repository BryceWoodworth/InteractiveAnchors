 
according time-saving bias drivers underestimate time saved when increasing low speed overestimate time saved when increasing relatively high speed
previous research used specific type task  drivers were asked estimate time saved when increasing speed give numeric response  show
present research conducted two studies multiple questions show time-saving bias occurs other tasks
study number found drivers committed time-saving bias when asked estimate time saved when increasing speed b distance completed at given time when increasing speed c speed required complete given distance decreasing times
study number showed no major differences estimations time saved compared estimations remaining journey time also between responses given numeric scale versus visual analog scale
study number tested two possible explanations time-saving bias proportion heuristic differences heuristic
some evidence was found use latter
 introduction 
if you need complete number km journey how much time would take at mean speed number kph
most people would find easy answer question  number km at number kph takes half hour number minutes
but what if you wanted increase speed order reduce journey time
how much time would you save if you increase your speed number kph number number kph
many people consistently give wrong answers questions
several studies shown people underestimate time saved when increasing relatively low speed overestimate time saved when increasing relatively high speed
