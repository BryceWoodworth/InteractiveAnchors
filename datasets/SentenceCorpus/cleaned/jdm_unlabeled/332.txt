 introduction 
based his counterintuitive observation concerning neighborhood segregation nobel laureate thomas schelling established what would become large influential literature connecting various subfields social sciences
schelling's observations was even absence intrinsic aversion those who belong other groups without anyone explicitly aiming locate themselves segregated community high levels segregation could nevertheless result modest desire avoid being too much relative minority
when one observes sharp ethnic segregation exists regrettably large number us cities schelling argued ought not conclude necessarily result anti-ethnic sentiment among either majority minority group members
schelling's classic segregation model shows example when people happy any location at up half their neighbors belong different ethnic group one should nevertheless predict dramatic segregation into nearly homogeneous ethnic blocs no individual explicitly sought wished
incongruity macro consequences do not reflect individual objectives overarching theme referred title schelling's micromotives macrobehavior
particular relevance judgment decision making researchers hope link  lack link was schelling's argument  between individual-level decision-making process macro spatial dynamics
one might dismiss relevance schelling's very simple model complexity real-world neighborhoods other social communities academic departments where methodological splits into subgroups sometimes lead conflict segregation e g empirical versus theoretical divides common economics departments social psychologists interacting quite separately other sub-disciplines within psychology departments
yet schelling's model widely used inform analyses policies at virtually all levels local state federal government well among private firms non-profits universities dealing segregation many kinds
although schelling's neighborhood segregation model gave rise substantial new literature remains active day there important mismatch between theory empirical observation received relatively little attention
schelling's model predicts high levels segregation starting virtually anywhere within very large set initial conditions parameter values
yet empirical studies documenting various forms segregation e g ethnic types among cities gender types among work places methodological types among academic institutions reveal considerable variation extent social groups observed engage inter-group mixing
whereas world presents observers rich variety heterogeneous segregation outcomes schelling's theory does not easily account variation systematic function variables parameters within model raises interesting questions
schelling model squared real world data
there extensions schelling model come closer reality predicting heterogeneous segregation levels vary systematically observable factors environment
paper presents extension
augment schelling's classic model endowing agents recognition memory
capacity enables simulated agents apply face-recognition heuristic
face refers evolved capacity key our model namely recording faces into recognition memory
at same time acronym face fast acceptance common experience refers insight shared local experience facilitate rapid formation relationships thus transform assessments others' underlying quality process recognized face quality its associated memory i e positive negative absolutely over-rules inference would been made stereotyping based group identity
according definition fast acceptance common experience refers rapidly formed recognition-based classifications others' quality e g acceptable versus unacceptable neighbor without regard group identity when classifying those whom face-to-face experience taken place past
when classifying those whose faces unrecognized classification continues strictly according group identity i e ethnic stereotyping
when unrecognized other person classified face-recognition heuristic reduces stereotyping based solely group identity exactly same classic schelling model
however when there even small amount shared experience quality shared experience past determines how other people classified
classifications based recognition memory lexicographically over-rule group identity basis classification unrecognized agents both face classic schelling models
given plausibility assumption context-specific experience past influence classification others came surprise us could not find any previous attempts extend schelling model direction
model shows when agents possess face-recognition lasts short single period encoding maximum only number individual faces out substantially larger population alone enough produce significantly higher levels integration
key comparison investigated paper concerns variable degree recognition memory e g no recognition memory classic schelling model versus any positive number periods faces those one encounters remains coded memory
introducing variable recognition memory representation heterogeneity real-world environments sometimes few sometimes many opportunities random face-to-face encounters other-type agents model investigates novel source systematic variation into otherwise classic model segregation
motivation studying effect recognition classification segregation better understand why some real-world environments succeed at achieving sustained levels cross-group interaction i e high levels integration while others seem locked into stubbornly unchanging pattern segregation
model intended contribute substantively constructively policy analysis simple message namely relatively cheaply design institutions produce modest opportunities face-to-face encounters members other groups
then extent people use acceptance rule based partially recognition random face-to-face inter-group mixing could potentially generate large stable levels integration too pessimistically ruled out vast majority studies based schelling's model
paper structured follows
outline classic schelling model neighborhood segregation review previous research related our extension paradigm present limitations classic schelling model mismatch between its predictions real world segregation data motivate our extension
then introduce face-recognition heuristic specify recognition-augmented schelling model encompassing model nests classic schelling model special case
subsequently present series agent-based simulations demonstrating effect agents' recognition memory decision rules micro-level their spatial distribution environment macro-level
