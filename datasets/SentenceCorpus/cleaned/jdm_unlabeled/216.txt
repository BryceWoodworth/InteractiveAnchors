at least two separate constructs capture degrees belief likelihoods capturing evidential balance support capturing evidential weight
paper explores weight justification evidence affords propositions subjects communicating using belief function hypothetical legal situations where justification relevant goal
subjects evaluated impact sets numbernumber pieces evidence varying complexity within hypothetical legal situation
study demonstrates potential usefulness evidential weight measure alternative complement more-studied probability measure
subjects' responses indicated weight likelihood were distinguished subjects' evidential weight tended toward single elements targeted fashion there were identifiable individual differences reactions conflicting evidence
specifically most subjects reacted conflicting evidence supported disjoint sets suspects continued support implicated sets although identifiable minority reacted pulling back their support expressing indecisiveness
individuals would likely require greater amount evidence than others counteract tendency support
thus study identifies value understanding evidential weight distinct likelihood informs our understanding psychology individuals' judgments evidential weight furthers application meaningfulness belief functions communication language
 introduction 
probabilities useful when acting absence complete knowledge e g forecasting decision making
probabilities interpreted measures degrees likelihood assessed against criterion truth
scoring rules assessments quality probability judgments operate perspective comparing likelihood assessments actual outcomes application truth criterion
however very origins probability theory scholars recognized truth not only criterion potential interest interpreting probabilities
smith benson curley tied recognition philosophical analysis knowledge number justified true belief number use probabilities qualifications beliefs fall short knowledge
analysis highlights two separate criteria along beliefs may qualified truth justification
theoretical distinction forms basis long-standing differentiation between pascalian probability based likelihood relative criterion truth baconian probability based support relative criterion justification

distinction also basis common differentiation between weight balance evidence traced keynes played major role motivating study ambiguity decision-making beginning ellsberg
short likelihoods intended capture balance evidence connected criterion truth
if true not-a false
degree evidence favors balance evidence moves toward away not-a equal measure
weight evidence connected criterion justification
weight depends upon quantity credibility evidence how much good evidence there
how well does evidence afford any differentiation possibilities
unlike evidential balance evidential weight does not imply complementarity
probability theory when judgment one hypothesis increases sum judgments remaining hypotheses must decrease same amount
truth one only one mutually exclusive set events occur thus likelihoods should exhibit complementarity probabilities capture feature
contrast evidential weight construct grounded criterion justification not expected exhibit property
increased support one possibility does not necessarily impinge support other possibilities
belief functions dempster-shafer theory discussed paper justification-based measures do not incorporate complementarity necessary axiom
one source confusion between constructs likelihood weight measures attached them constructs measures generally correlate
useful analogy drawn here height weight two aspects size
though measures correlate they capture distinct size constructs
similarly probabilities measures likelihood belief functions measures justification may correlate but they capture different degree-of-belief constructs
griffin tversky provided demonstration usefulness distinction showing how inclusion considerations weight addition balance evidence serve explain various empirical characteristics confidence judgments
there number situations justification primary interest decision maker interest addition truth
example justification interest legal settings where goal remove doubt stock analysis emphasis upon justifying recommendations clients diagnostic tasks truth not feasibly determinable e g within public policy debates scientific inference
despite history their potential usefulness measures justification been little studied empirically been confounded measures likelihood
research probably been somewhat hampered respective different natures truth justification
probability theory capturing likelihoods benefits ultimate realization truth many instances applied because underpinnings randomization relative frequency historically derives
application system used capturing justification use dempster-shafer theory purpose more equivocal about underlying theoretical mechanisms supporting judgments
here argument applying dempster-shafer theory based correspondence between aspects evidential weight unique features theory e g its noncomplementarity natural representation ignorance i e case where no information present
terms previous work using dempster-shafer theory most prior research system been theoretical example pursuing use belief functions propagating uncertainty ai expert systems addition instead using probabilities
although sparse there some suggestive empirical work
cited work griffin tversky directly extensive work effects ambiguity decision making indirectly testify relevance evidential weight decision behavior
addition responses hypothetical legal contexts emphasize justification exhibit noncomplementarity degrees belief manner consistent tenets dempster-shafer theory
briggs krantz adopted measurement perspective demonstrated judgments evidential strength separable
subjects number showed clear separation relevant irrelevant evidence designated surrounding relevant evidence number p number
sum results support value viability measuring evidential weight distinct more commonly assessed construct likelihood
since likelihood judgments received more attention than weight judgments often confused them particular emphasis must placed distinction
specifically important distinctions discussions literature need drawn separating justification-based measures present application dempster-shafer theory weak theories likelihood theory subjective probability called support theory
