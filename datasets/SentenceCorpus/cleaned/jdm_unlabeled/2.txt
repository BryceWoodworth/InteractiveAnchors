 
according siegrist earle gutscher's model risk communication effect advice about risk agent's behavior depends agent's trust competence advisor their trust motives advisor
trust competence depends how good advice received source been past
trust motives depends how similar agent assesses advisor's values their own
show past quality advice degree similarity between advisors' judges' values separate non-interacting effects two types agent behavior degree trust expressed source stated trust weight given source's advice revealed trust
findings support siegrist et al 's model
also found revealed trust was affected more than stated trust differences advisor quality
not clear how finding should accommodated within siegrist et al 's model
 introduction 
throughout social sciences trust recognized important factor mediates many aspects human behavior
definitions trust vary but widely accepted one psychological state comprising intention accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations intentions behavior another
thus person trustor who depends someone else trustee expects reduce likelihood size negative outcome some situation when dependence misplaced expected value outcome lower
experimental work trust been carried out various contexts including behavioral game theory on-line commerce risk communication
work report here falls into last three domains
risk communication provides information fallible gives people advice about levels risk associated hazards
reliance advisors signals acceptance vulnerability based expectations those advisors competent well-meaning when fact they may not
reliance provides evidence trust sense encapsulated above definition
when people rely more certain advisors say their behavior reveals they more trust those advisors
recent research into trust indicates determined number factors
factors broadly categorized into two groups
first concerns competence trustee ability competence expertise knowledge
second concerns motives trustee benevolence integrity honesty fairness
basis findings siegrist earle gutscher siegrist gutscher earle developed their trust-confidence-cooperation tcc model
simplified version shown figure number
according model two different types trust determine degree people cooperate their advisors
first trust motives also known simply trust social trust second trust competence known confidence
cooperative intention produced two types trust results cooperative behaviors various types
example people may express trust their advisors they may use advice them form their own judgments they may act basis their advice
trust competence determined past history quality advice produced source
type information already been shown affect advice-taking people place greater weight information received sources who been more accurate past
trust motives determined how similar judge assesses advisor's values their own
siegrist et al 's model predicts people will take more advice advisors whose values they judge more similar their own
date prediction their two-route model not been tested
our aim here provide test
past researchers into advice-taking measured trust advice using behavioral measures
example given two different pieces advice value numerical variable e g risk level judgment closer first than second indicates greater influence first
hence relative proximity judgments advice different sources provides behavioral means assessing relative influence those sources advice
contrast researchers into trust required people make verbal numerical estimates their trust different sources information  typically using rating scales
however o'neill argued behavioral verbal measures trust may not always coincide
example people may state they do not trust agent when their behavior reveals they do
they may do because behavioral placement trust relies implicit intuitive nonconscious processes not easily accessed explicit processes required verbal expression trust
indeed there some evidence stated revealed trust do dissociate under certain conditions
given results shall measure trust both ways present study
siegrist et al 's model predicts similarity values intentions goals will increase trust motives thereby increase influence advisor judge
however does not make any prediction about effects physical similarity advisor judge
nevertheless there good reason expect people will more influenced advisors who same sex they who approximately same age they
because there persuasive evidence attitudes values particularly those relating risk technology more likely similar people same sex similar age
result physical i e age sex similarity may imply degree value similarity
if does advisors who physically similar judges likely trusted more
also advisors who similar judges both respects likely trusted more than those who similar them just one respect
