 
oppenheimer monin recently found subjectively rare events taken indicate longer preceding sequence unobserved trials than subjectively common events effect they refer retrospective gambler's fallacy
current paper extends idea situation where participants judge likelihood streak continuation
participants were told about streak produced random process coin flips human performance basketball shots either predicted next outcome inferred immediately preceding outcome
coin scenarios participants tended expect streak termination  gambler's fallacy  effect was same predictions retrospective inferences
basketball scenarios no overall bias was found either prospective retrospective judgments
results support oppenheimer monin's suggestion reconstruction past entails same heuristics prediction future they also support idea nature data-generating process key determinant whether people fall into gambler's fallacy
suggested term retrospective gambler's fallacy used describe situations where streak taken indicate preceding unobserved outcome was opposite type phenomenon discovered oppenheimer monin referred retrospective representativeness retrospective belief law small numbers
 introduction 
recent article journal oppenheimer monin raised possibility people's judgments about past history random process might display same biases their predictions future outcomes
oppenheimer monin focussed gambler's fallacy  belief streak one outcome raises probability other outcome above base rate
most common explanation gambler's fallacy people employ representativeness heuristic  they believe law small numbers small samples should representative underlying probabilities run one outcome needs balanced out occurrence opposite outcome
oppenheimer monin suggested gambler's fallacy might also operate when people reconstruct past history random process
rather than having participants predict future outcomes they asked people estimate number trials had preceded occurrence particular event
example participants were asked imagine walking into room find man flipping coin five times either producing streak five heads mix three heads two tails
participants were then asked how many times man had flipped coin before they entered room
estimates participants streak condition were much larger than those participants non-streak condition
result generalizes across wide variety domains oppenheimer monin found estimated number previous trials was greater when outcome was subjectively unlikely effect they refer retrospective gambler's fallacy
effect important because suggests heuristics biases shape our predictions future also colour our reconstruction past
however notable focus oppenheimer monin's work not gambler's fallacy traditionally conceived
rather than examining judgments about outcomes previous trials manner analogous prediction future outcomes authors focussed estimates number preceding trials
oppenheimer monin note most straightforward instantiation retrospective gambler's fallacy would formally identical gambler's fallacy only past


while would natural extension gambler's fallacy our knowledge never been tested p number
current experiment supplements oppenhemier monin's work providing test
participants were told about streak one outcome asked either predict next outcome infer outcome trial before streak
additional manipulation data-generating process was varied some participants was physical process likely regarded random coin flipping whilst others was skill-based action basketball shooting
motivation was although gambler's fallacy widespread some judgment domains produce opposite bias  belief streak one outcome increases probability outcome
