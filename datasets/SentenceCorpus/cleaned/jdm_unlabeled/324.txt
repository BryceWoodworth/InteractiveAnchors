more strategies considered larger number dependent measures simultaneously taken into account strategy classification more complex selection most diagnostic tasks becomes
suggest euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method standardized solution problem
according edts experimental tasks selected maximize average difference between strategy predictions any multidimensional prediction space
comprehensive model recovery simulation evaluate quantify influence diagnostic task selection identification rates strategy classification
strategy classification edts shows superior performance comparison less diagnostic task selection algorithms representative sampling
advantage edts particularly large if only few dependent measures considered
also provide easy-to-use function free software package r allows generating predictions most commonly considered strategies specified set tasks evaluating diagnosticity those tasks via edts thus apply edts no prior programming knowledge necessary
 introduction 
identification individuals' decision strategies always challenged behavioral decision research
there at least three traditional approaches
structural modeling applies regression based approach identify relation between distal criterion variable proximal cues peoples' judgments process tracing methods example record information search use think aloud protocols trace decision process whereas comparative model fitting approaches investigate fit data predictions different models determine model decision strategy employed
comparative model fitting particular gained popularity recent judgment decision making jdm research
paper discuss problem diagnostic task selection when using strategy classification method
suggest euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method standardized solution
