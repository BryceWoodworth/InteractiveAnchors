participants were presented series choices involved either losses gains
each choice they were forced choose between sure thing gamble same expected value
choices involving losses participants were more risk seeking oxygen depleted environment those involving gains no difference was found
 introduction 
hypoxia result inadequate oxygen supply cells tissues body
low aerial oxygen concentration first detected sensory receptors carotid body then relayed hypothalamus
body responds decrease oxygen arterial saturation increasing heart rate blood pressure ventilation production stress hormones
alterations driven sympathetic nervous system could reach awareness if oxygen depletion sufficiently high
however mild oxygen depletion not easily detected higher-order brain structures
research investigated effects hypoxia human cognitive functions
most studies focused basic functions visual perception memory attention language
data show number percent reduction arterial blood oxygen saturation diminishes individuals' concentration capacity muscular coordination impairs language production visual perception
number percent reduction arterial blood oxygen saturation diminishes memory performance induces emotional lability major motor impairments
present research aim investigate effect hypoxia judgment decision making
believe research worth pursuing two reasons
first people frequently experience mild levels hypoxia during prolonged physical exercise underwater diving high altitude recreational activities e g mountaineering paragliding parachuting flight when defect occurs cabin pressurization system
second bad judgments decisions during activities fatal
although there no direct research impact hypoxia judgment decision making there research concerning impact its effect stress
current views cognitive system architecture nested within dual-process approaches suggest stressful conditions affect decision-making broadening prevalence intuitive automatic processes over analytic deliberative ones
stressful situations individuals might rely simple rules thumb heuristics rather than analytic processes aim maximize subjective utility
although heuristics certain contexts efficient guides routine but complex tasks others they lead systematic biases
example recent research shown acute stress induced keeping ones hand freezing water modulates gamble decisions partially exacerbating bias known reflection effect people's tendency avoid risk secure certain gain seek risk avoid certain loss
present research investigated whether oxygen depletion also leads exacerbation reflection effect
laboratory setting compared decisions made mildly oxygen-depleted environment those made normoxic environment
contrast previous studies where participants were aware stressor used e g time pressure cold water social pressure participants present study were not aware mild oxygen depletion
