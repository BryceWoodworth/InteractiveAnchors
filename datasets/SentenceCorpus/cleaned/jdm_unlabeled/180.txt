although potentially applicable every discipline amount training mathematics students typically receive varies greatly between different disciplines
those disciplines where most researchers do not master mathematics use mathematics may held too much awe
demonstrate i conducted online experiment number participants all had experience reading research reports postgraduate degree any subject
participants were presented abstracts two published papers one evolutionary anthropology one sociology
based abstracts participants were asked judge quality research
either one other two abstracts was manipulated through inclusion extra sentence taken completely unrelated paper presenting equation made no sense context
included meaningless mathematics tended judged higher quality
however nonsense math effect was not found among participants degrees mathematics science technology medicine
 introduction 
background paper my own subjective experience mid-career move pure mathematics interdisciplinary work social science cultural studies
areas like sociology evolutionary anthropology i found mathematics often used ways my viewpoint were illegitimate make point would better made only simple logic uncritically take properties mathematical model properties real world include mathematics make paper look more impressive
those areas social sciences humanities broadly recognized mathematics valuable tool mathematical skills may still generally too low optimal use tool
there may lack understanding what mathematics should used what cannot should not used
if mathematics held awe unhealthy way its use not subjected sufficient levels critical thinking
within field pure mathematics academic writing expected completely transparent anyone knowledgeable about mathematical concepts involved
typical reviewer pure mathematics paper will not tolerate sentence paragraph meaning obscure
same cannot said about some other academic disciplines
mathematical physicist alan sokal famously composed paper was deliberately obscure nonsensical he submitted journal social text where editors accepted publication
so called sokal hoax demonstrated there experienced readers research publications who will not necessarily react adversely fact text cannot really made sense
indeed sokal bricmont documented book following up hoax obscurity hallmark certain academic traditions associated terms like postmodernism relativism
however science-bashing genres were not responsible abuse mathematics i referred above contrary i found mathematics poorly used fields where tools science held uncritically high regard
acceptance admiration writing actually does not make much sense may found both camps
course my personal impressions may biased
perhaps there no widespread acceptance admiration obscure nonsensical use mathematics social sciences humanities if there perhaps just widespread areas like technology natural sciences where everyone learns how use mathematics
order obtain some hard evidence i conducted experiment
brief i recruited participants research experience varying disciplines
participants were presented two abstracts published papers good journals asked judge quality research presented abstracts
one two abstracts randomly chosen was manipulated addition extra sentence
sentence was taken completely unrelated paper presented equation made no sense context
