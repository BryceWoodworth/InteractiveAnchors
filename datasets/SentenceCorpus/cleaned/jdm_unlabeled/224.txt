 
standard preference models consumer research assume people weigh add all attributes available options derive decision while there growing evidence use simplifying heuristics
recently greedoid algorithm been developed model lexicographic heuristics preference data
compare predictive accuracies greedoid approach standard conjoint analysis online study rating ranking task
lexicographic model derived greedoid algorithm was better at predicting ranking compared rating data but overall achieved lower predictive accuracy hold-out data than compensatory model estimated conjoint analysis
however considerable minority participants was better predicted lexicographic strategies
conclude new algorithm will not replace standard tools analyzing preferences but boost study situational individual differences preferential choice processes
 introduction 
how do customers choose abundance products modern retail outlets
how many attributes do they consider how do they process them form preference
questions theoretical well practical interest
gaining insights into processes people follow while making purchase decisions will lead better informed decision theories
at same time marketers interested more realistic decision models predicting market shares optimizing marketing actions example adapting products advertising materials consumers' choice processes
consumer research decision models based idea utility maximization predominate date expressed prevalent use weighted additive models derived conjoint analysis capture preferences
at same time judgment decision making researchers propose alternative decision heuristics supposed provide psychologically more valid accounts human decision making gather evidence their use
recently field judgment decision making been equipped new tool greedoid algorithm deduce lexicographic decision processes preference data developed independently yee et al kohli jedidi
aim bring together two lines research comparing predictive performance lexicographic decision processes deduced new greedoid algorithm weighted additive models estimated full profile regression-based conjoint analysis standard tool consumer research
derive hypotheses theoretical framework adaptive decision making about when approach should better-suited tool test them empirical study
