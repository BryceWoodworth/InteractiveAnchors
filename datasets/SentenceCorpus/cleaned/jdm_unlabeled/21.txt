 
research endeavors determine effectiveness patient decision aids ptdas yielded mixed results
conflicting evaluations largely due different metrics used assess validity judgments made using ptdas
different approaches characterized hammond's two frameworks evaluating judgments correspondence coherence
paper reviews literature effectiveness ptdas recasts argument renewed debate between two meta-theories judgment
evaluation correspondence criteria involves measuring impact patient decision aids metrics there objective external empirically justifiable values
evaluation coherence criteria involves assessing degree decisions follow logical implications internal possibly subjective value systems preferences
coherence exist absent correspondence vice versa
therefore many seemingly conflicting results regarding effectiveness ptdas reconciled considering two meta-theories contribute unique perspectives
argue one approach cannot substitute other researchers should not deny value either approach
furthermore suggest future research evaluating ptdas include both correspondence coherence criteria
 introduction 
number kenneth hammond argued field judgment decision making taken two distinct paths describing those two paths meta-theories used evaluation judgments
correspondence meta-theory judgments compared objective facts explicit goal evaluating empirical accuracy judgments
contrast coherence meta-theory assesses logical consistency judgments
framework judgments evaluated degree they similar solutions given logical mathematical statistical theories
judgments not compared external true value instead judgments compared normative rule often mathematical nature
