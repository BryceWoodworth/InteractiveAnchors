 
four-fold classification emotions respect their functions decision making proposed
argued emotions not homogenous concerning their role decision making but four distinct functions distinguished concerning emotional phenomena
one function provide information about pleasure pain preference construction second function enable rapid choices under time pressure third function focus attention relevant aspects decision problem fourth function generate commitment concerning morally socially significant decisions
pertinent literature relationship between emotion decision making reviewed concluded most approaches fit into proposed framework
argue precise conceptualization emotional phenomena required advance our understanding complex role emotions decision making
 introduction 
paper address question how conceptualize emotions concerning their role decision making
study emotions context decision making beginning more than twenty years ago received increasing attention over past decade
there however little consensus literature what actually meant emotion affect
paper tries contribute more precise useful conceptualization emotion concerning emotion-decision making relationship
first briefly sketch two approaches similar objective classification emotions loewenstein lerner functional typology proposed peters
will then discuss some common assumptions about emotions believe confused understanding role emotion decision making
particular argue emotions should not construed homogenous category positive-negative valence dimension not most important aspect emotions decision making emotions do not imply irrationality
argue more useful think emotional phenomena implementing specific mechanisms account different functions arise decision making
