 
recently been observed different choices made about structurally identical risky decisions depending whether information about outcomes their probabilities learned description experience
current evidence equivocal respect whether choice gap entirely artefact biased samples
current experiment investigates whether representational bias exists at point encoding examining choice light decision makers' mental representations alternatives measured both verbal nonverbal judgment probes
found when estimates were gauged nonverbal probe participants presented information description format opposed experience had greater tendency overestimate rare events underestimate common events
choice gap however remained even when accounting judgment distortion effects sampling bias
indeed participants' estimation outcome distribution did not mediate their subsequent choice
appears experience-based choices may derive process does not explicitly use probability information
 introduction 
recent years quickly growing literature emerged contrasting two different formats choice  description experience  correspondence decisions observed each
decision experience dfe one where possible outcomes estimates their probabilities learned through integration personal observation feedback environment
typical example might decision where buy your morning coffee you make your way work
contrast decision description dfd one where all possible outcomes their probabilities explicitly laid out outset
typical example might decision bring umbrella work after hearing morning weather forecast chance precipitation
surprisingly recent evidence found decisions made under two different formats choice diverge
example hertwig barron weber erev presented six binary risky choice problems participants either described experienced format
description format outcomes their probabilities were completely specified form choose between number certain b number probability number percent otherwise zero
participants playing description-based choice task tended make decisions consistent prospect theory's four-fold pattern choice  risk-aversion gains risk-seeking losses when probabilities were moderate high but risk-seeking gains risk-aversion losses when probabilities were small
example number percent participants preferred certain number decision above
experience format participants were initially unaware outcomes their respective probabilities had learn information sampling two unlabelled buttons
each sample presented randomly selected outcome taken underlying outcome distribution same structure problems presented description format
participants were free sample often any order they liked until they were ready select one option play real
strikingly participants playing experienced-based choice task tended make decisions opposite four-fold pattern choice
example only number percent participants preferred certain number decision above
apparent description-experience gap led some call development separate distinct theories risky choice
fox hadar however argued conclusion unwarranted light reanalysis hertwig et al data
specifically they found prospect theory could satisfactorily account patterns choice when based participants' experienced distribution outcomes due sampling errors was often different objective distribution sampled outcomes derived
crux debate centres relative importance sampling bias
issue led investigators employ number creative designs produced conflicting results
