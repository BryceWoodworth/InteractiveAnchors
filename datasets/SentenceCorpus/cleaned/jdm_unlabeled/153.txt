 
recent research emphasized emotion's role non-utilitarian judgments but not focused much characteristics subjects contributing those judgments
present article relates utilitarian judgment individual disposition experience various emotions
study number first investigated relationship among state emotions utilitarian judgment
diverse emotions were elicited during judgment guilt sadness disgust empathy anger anxiety etc
using psychological scales study number found trait emotions predict extent utilitarian judgments especially trait anger trait disgust trait empathy
unlike previous research designated emotions only factors mitigating utilitarian judgment research shows trait anger correlates positively utilitarian judgment
other hand disgust empathy correlated negatively
guilt shame-though previous research argued their absence increased utilitarian judgment-appear unrelated extent utilitarian judgment

 introduction 
no matter what happens courtroom all comes down emotion jury
 boston legal trolley dilemma runaway trolley headed five people who will killed unless steps taken stop
only way save them hit switch will turn trolley onto alternate track where will kill one person instead five
should you turn trolley order save five people at expense one
according greene sommerville nystrom darley cohen most people said yes
now consider another problem footbridge dilemma
before trolley threatens kill five people
you standing next large stranger footbridge spans tracks between oncoming trolley five people
scenario only way save five people push stranger off bridge your own hands onto tracks below
he will die if you do however his body will stop trolley reaching others
should you save five others pushing stranger his death
most people say no
question why not
utilitarianism defined idea morally correct course action one produces greatest total benefit all people affected
psychological point view utilitarian judgments defined endorsing harmful actions promote greater good judgments favoring aggregate welfare over welfare fewer individuals
there differences between trolley dilemma footbridge dilemma greene et al labeled them impersonal moral dilemma personal moral dilemma respectively
according greene haidt personal moral violations meet following criteria violation must likely cause serious bodily harm harm must befall particular person set people harm must not result deflection existing threat onto different party
short personal moral violation me hurt you i agent hurt you visible person front me
if fails meet criteria moral violation impersonal
using personal impersonal moral scenarios greene et al argued emotional engagements influence only personal moral situations opposed impersonal ones
addition had been shown moral judgment could induced hypnotic disgust
subsequent study emotion's role utilitarian judgment had been supported inducing positive affect resulted increasing utilitarian judgments
since then been suggested argument damage ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc increases utilitarian judgments because vmpfc damage causes emotional deficits-that absence guilt shame empathy
nonetheless there few empirical studies about people's individual disposition related emotion utilitarian judgments
was suggested judgments would vary individual individual
if tasks mood induction affect people's utilitarian judgment might think people's emotional disposition also affects moral judgment
