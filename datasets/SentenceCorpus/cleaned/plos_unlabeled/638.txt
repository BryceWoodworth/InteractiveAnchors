 
protein interactions play vital part function cell
experimental techniques detection validation protein interactions time consuming there need computational methods task
protein interactions appear form network relatively high degree local clustering
paper exploit clustering suggesting score based triplets observed protein interactions
score utilises both protein characteristics network properties
our score based triplets shown complement existing techniques predicting protein interactions outperforming them data sets display high degree clustering
predicted interactions score highly against test measures accuracy
compared similar score derived pairwise interactions only triplet score displays higher sensitivity specificity
looking at specific examples show how experimental set interactions enriched validated
part work also examine effect different prior databases upon accuracy prediction find interactions same kingdom give better results than across kingdoms suggesting there may fundamental differences between networks
results all emphasize network structure important helps accurate prediction protein interactions
protein interaction data set program used our analysis list predictions validations available at link
 introduction 
understanding complex activities within organism complete error-free network protein interactions occur organism would significant step forward
experimentally protein interactions detected number techniques data publicly available several databases dip database interacting proteins mips munich information center protein sequences
unfortunately experimentally detected interactions show high false negative high false positive rates
paper develop new computational approach predict interactions validate experimental data
computational methods already been developed purposes
interaction validation mainly centered use expression data co-functionality co-localisation proteins involved 
prediction protein interactions contrast many methods been suggested
majority generate lists proteins functional relationship rather than physical interactions 
terms physical interaction prediction available methods typified two approaches deng et al jonsson et al 
deng et al.'s method domain interaction based approach protein interaction inferred basis domain contacts
if domain pair frequently found observed protein interactions likely other protein pairs containing domain pair might also interact
observed protein interaction network probabilities domain-domain interactions estimated
expectation-maximum algorithm employed compute maximum likelihood estimates assuming protein interactions occur independently each other
likelihood then used construct probability score protein pair interact inferred based estimated probabilities domain interactions within protein pair
deng et al.'s prediction based total 5,719 interactions s.cerevisiae
however limited number known domains may well not enough describe variety protein interactions
approach had further extensions improved scoring domain interactions inclusion other biological information
liu et al.'s model extension deng et al.'s method integrates multiple organisms
addition s.cerevisiae two other organisms c.elegans d.melanogaster included
second type approach used jonsson et al homology-based
searches interlogs among protein interactions other organisms
if interlog protein interaction exists many other organisms protein interaction will score highly
addition searching orthologous interlogs mika saeed suggest paralogous interlogs may provide even more information inferring interacting protein pairs
principle statistical clustering algorithms identify cliques network could viewed prediction method predicting all proteins within clique interact each other
interpretation biologically questionable focus statistical clustering approach locating cliques overlapping modules rather than predicting individual interactions exclude our comparisons
neither deng et al.'s method nor jonsson et al.'s method make use network structure beyond pairwise interactions; interactions considered isolated pairs
however pairs could should considered network where proteins nodes their interactions links
topological examination networks revealed many interesting properties including clustering tendency see also supporting information
our method exploit network structure developing score considers triadic patterns interactions rather than pairs
paper thus take established idea characteristics protein will affect its interactions alongside not yet fully explored idea its network position will also affect its interactions order develop novel predictive tool
our goal predict protein interactions type x y where both x y interact third protein z therefore our approach particularly focus two simple three node network structures triangles lines
triangle subnet formed interacting protein pair common neighbour
line contrast subnet formed non-interacting protein pair common neighbour
will show network structures protein characteristics within them help predict protein interactions
apply our method s.cerevisiae interaction network dip database
during validation assume function structure known all proteins protein interaction network known all but one interaction
triadic interacting patterns predict interaction status those protein pairs at least one common neighbour compare our results those three other published scores
go demonstrate requirement fully annotated proteins relaxed include partially annotated proteins slight drop accuracy
prediction also compared simulated networks where all proteins shuffled while network structure maintained order examine whether specific network structure triangles lines keep useful information forming protein interaction networks
measure true positive rate set protein pairs deane et al proposed expression profile index measure true positive rate set protein pairs based biological relevance
compare epr index our score showing suitable cut-off our predictions achieve high true positive rate
also give examples validated experimental data predict new interactions
our predictive model uses prior interaction database use three prior databases pooling protein interactions collected prokaryotes eukaryotes all interactions
results using different prior databases show use interactions within same kingdom rather than across kingdoms significantly improves results indicating interaction networks may significantly different between kingdoms
comparing our method three other standard approaches namely domain-based approach deng et al extension liu et al homology-based approach jonsson et al find our method outperforms above approaches subset interactions dip yeast data set contains enough annotation connectivity included our analysis
our method complements methods deng et al liu et al their approaches apply rather different subset potential interactions yielded dip yeast data set
