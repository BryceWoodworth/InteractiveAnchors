 
50 percent progressing hiv-1 patients cxcr4-tropic virus emerges late infection often overtaking ccr5-tropic virus dominant viral strain
phenotypic switch strongly associated rapidly declining cd4 t cell counts aids onset yet its causes remain unknown
here analyze mathematical model mechanism x4 emergence late-stage hiv infection use analysis evaluate utility promising new class antiretroviral drugs ccr5 inhibitors dual r5 x4 infection
model shows r5-to-x4 switch occurs cd4 t cell activation levels increase above threshold cd4 t cell counts decrease below threshold during late-stage hiv infection
importantly model also shows highly active antiretroviral therapy inhibit x4 emergence but monotherapy ccr5 blockers accelerate x4 onset immunodeficiency if x4 infection memory cd4 t cells occurs at high rate
fortunately when cxcr4 blockers haart used conjunction ccr5 blockers risk accelerated immunodeficiency eliminated
results suggest ccr5 blockers will more effective when used combination cxcr4 blockers caution against ccr5 blockers absence effective haart regimen during haart failure
