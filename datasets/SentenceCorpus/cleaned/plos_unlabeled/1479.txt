better understanding molecular mechanism compounds needed determine risk
present high confidence human protein-protein association network built upon integration chemical toxicology systems biology
computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds diseases thus predicting compounds may risk factors human health
additionally network used identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals proteins
examples shown chemicals associated breast cancer lung cancer necrosis potential protein targets di-ethylhexyl-phthalate 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin pirinixic acid permethrine
chemical-protein associations supported through recent published studies illustrate power our approach integrates toxicogenomics data other data types
 introduction 
humans daily exposed diverse hazardous chemicals via skincare products plastic cups computers pesticides mention but few sources
potential effect environmental compounds human health major concern
example chemicals phthalate plasticizers been widely linked allergies reproductive disorders neurological defects
humans intentionally exposed drugs used treatment cure diseases
many drugs affect multiple targets may interact affect same proteins environmental chemicals
mechanism action small molecules often not completely understood associated adverse toxic effects through example drug-drug interactions
there thus need improve our understanding underlying mechanism action chemicals biological pathways they perturb fully evaluate impact small molecules human health
essential step towards deciphering effect chemicals human health identify all possible molecular targets given chemical
various network-oriented chemical pharmacology approaches been published recently identify novel protein candidates drugs using structural chemical similarity
example keiser et al applied network analysis drugs their targets
authors identified unexpected molecular targets muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m 3 alpha-2 adrenergic receptor neurokinin nk2 receptor methadone emetine loperamide respectively
additionally recent studies demonstrated chemicals could classified based upon their effect mrna expression detected microarrays
lamb et al showed genomic signatures could used recognize drugs common mechanism action allowing discovery unknown modes action
despite explosion chemical-biological networks chemical toxicity remains major issue human health
analysis environmental chemicals similar gene expression profiles still lacking
recent advances toxicogenomics information gene/protein activity response small molecule exposures becomes more available
provide necessary data develop computational systems biology models predict both high level associations more detailed associations
paper present method associate chemicals disease identify potential molecular targets based integration toxicogenomics data chemical structures protein-protein interaction data disease information functional annotation
core our procedure derived target hopping concept defined previously
but instead considering only binding activity extended concept gene expression
if two proteins affected two chemicals then both proteins deemed associating chemical space
our approach not only statistical model but mimics true biological system constructing network associations between human proteins defined protein-protein association network
validated our network comparison two high confidence protein-protein interaction networks assessing functional enrichment clusters network generated
p-pan revealed both known well many novel surprising connections between chemicals diseases proteins
provide literature support some unexpected associations connection between diethylhexylphthalate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor beta target well between apocarotenal chemical found spinach necrosis
illustrates usefulness approach integrates toxicogenomics data other diverse data types
