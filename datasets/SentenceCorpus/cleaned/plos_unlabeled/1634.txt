 introduction 
modelling responses compensatory adaptations living organisms changing environment extremely important both terms scientific understanding its potential impact global health
although computational modelling ecological systems been utilised ecotoxicology application systems biology approaches non-model organisms general presents formidable difficulties partly due limited sequence information environmentally relevant sentinel species
moreover number samples depth information available often limited there may lack truly relevant physiological endpoints
thus omics proven effective finding responses aquatic organisms model toxicants laboratory-based experiments but environment poses greater challenge anthropogenic contaminants present complex mixtures responses will additionally dependent upon natural life history traits other environmental factors
relatively few omics studies focussed upon ecotoxicology environmentally sampled fish
although previously shown expression stress response genes could used distinguish fish environmental sampling sites different underlying contaminant burdens gave little insight health outcomes molecular differences
context identifying molecular mechanisms compensatory toxic responses observational data approach been so successful clinical studies laboratory model organisms highly challenging field studies
addressed challenge developing novel network inference strategy based integration multi-level measurements populations fish exposed diverse spectrum environmental pollutants
provides useful model network biology approach generally applicable non-model species represents breakthrough way study mechanisms whereby organisms respond chemical exposure environment
directed our efforts towards modelling molecular networks representative populations flatfish european flounder sampled marine environments north western europe including locations significantly impacted anthropogenic chemical contaminants
study integrated measurements representing broad spectrum samples characterized using transcriptomics metabolomics conventional biomarkers analysis chemicals sediments sampling sites
previous studies shown both anthropogenic contamination higher prevalence pre-neoplastic neoplastic lesions flounder elbe estuary mersey tyne together elevated levels hepatic dna adducts at sites
data integration was achieved implementing systems biology framework network reconstruction starting cross-species mapping sequence information integration multi-level datasets within framework network inference culminating identification network modules predictive physiological responses chemical exposure valuable marine monitoring 
networks identified demonstrate remarkable parallel between human liver carcinogenesis environmental effects fish liver well revealing potentially novel adaptation mechanisms
broader application network biology approaches other non-model species sampled environment therefore likely profoundly change our understanding how living systems likely adapt complex environments
