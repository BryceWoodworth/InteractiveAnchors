within framework wbe model based eight assumptions derives well-known observed scaling exponent 3/4

failure clarify explore nature approximation led debates about wbe model were at cross purposes
compute analytical expressions finite-size corrections 3/4 exponent resulting spectrum scaling exponents function absolute network size
when accounting corrections over size range spanning eight orders magnitude observed mammals wbe model predicts scaling exponent 0.81 seemingly at odds data
then proceed study sensitivity scaling exponent respect variations several assumptions underlie wbe model always context finite-size corrections

 introduction 
whole-organism metabolic rate b scales body mass m across species formulawhere b 0 normalization constant allometric scaling exponent typically measured very close 3/4
empirical regularity expressed equation 1 3/4 known kleiber's law 
many other biological rates times scale simple multiples 1/4
example cellular mass-specific metabolic rates heart respiratory rates ontogenetic growth rates scale m 1/4 whereas blood circulation time development time lifespan scale close m 1/4
quarter-power scaling also observed ecology evolution
occurrence quarter-power scaling at diverse levels biological organization suggests all rates closely linked
metabolic rate seems most fundamental because rate at energy materials taken up environment transformed biochemical reactions allocated maintenance growth reproduction
series papers starting 1997 west brown enquist published model account 3/4-power scaling metabolic rate body mass across species
broad theory biological allometry developed wbe collaborators attributes quarter-power scaling near-optimal fractal-like designs resource distribution networks exchange surfaces
there some evidence designs realized at molecular organelle cellular organismal levels wide variety plants animals 
intensifying controversy surrounded wbe model since its original publication even extending debate about quality analysis data
one most frequently raised objections wbe model cannot predict scaling exponents metabolic rate deviate 3/4 even though potential deviations was appreciated wbe themselves
if criticism were true wbe could not principle explain data taxa whose scaling exponents been reported above below 3/4 deviations 3/4 been observed small mammals
likewise wbe model would unable account scaling maximal metabolic rate body mass appears exponent 0.88
important note actual nature maximal metabolic rate scaling however not without its own controversy; see argument maximal metabolic rate scales closer 3/4 when body temperature taken into consideration
much work aimed at answering criticisms relied alteration wbe model itself
enquist collaborators account different scaling exponents among taxonomic groups emphasizing differences normalization constant b 0 equation 1 deviations wbe assumptions regarding network geometry
while results suggestive remains unclear whether not wbe predict exponents significantly different 3/4 measurable deviations pure power law even absence any variation b 0 networks following exactly geometry required theory
although wbe been frequently tested applied remarkable no theoretical work been published provides more detailed predictions original theory
also work aimed at extending wbe relaxing modifying some its assumptions hardly been complete; many variations network structure might important far-reaching consequences once properly analyzed
what set out do present contribution
show misunderstanding original model led claim wbe only predict 3/4 exponent
because many predictions tests original model derived leading-order approximations
paper derive more precise predictions tests
purpose stating our conclusions succinctly refer wbe framework approach explaining allometric scaling phenomena terms resource distribution networks wbe model instance wbe framework employs particular parameters specifying geometry dynamics networks
our main findings are: 1
3/4 exponent only holds exactly limit organisms infinite size
2
finite-sized organisms show wbe model does not predict pure power-law but rather curvilinear relationship between logarithm metabolic rate logarithm body mass 3
although wbe recognized finite size effects would produce deviations pure 3/4 power scaling small mammals infinite size limit constitutes idealization magnitude importance finite-size effects were unclear
show when emulating current practice calculating scaling exponent straight line regressed curvilinear relationship over entire range body masses exponent predicted wbe model differ significantly 3/4 without any modifications its assumptions framework
4
when realistic parameter values employed construct network find exponent resulting finite-size corrections comes at 0.81 significantly higher than 3/4 figure based current data analysis
5
our data analysis indeed detects curvilinearity relationship between logarithm metabolic rate logarithm body mass however curvilinearity opposite what observe wbe model
implies wbe model needs amendment and/or data analysis needs reassessment
beyond finite-size corrections examine original assumptions wbe two ways
first vary predicted switch-over point above vascular network architecture preserves total cross-sectional area vessels at branchings below increases total cross-sectional area at branchings
two regimes translate into different ratios daughter parent radii at vessel branch points
second allow network branching ratios differ large small vessels
analyze sensitivity scaling exponent respect each changes context networks finite size
approach similar spirit price et al who relaxed network geometry other assumptions wbe context plants
supplementary online material text s1 also argue data analysis should account log-normal distribution body mass abundance thus correcting fact there more small mammals than large ones
despite differences structure hydrodynamics vascular systems plants animals detailed models each yield scaling exponent 3/4 leading-order
present paper focus wbe model cardiovascular system mammals
all our assumptions derivations calculations should interpreted within context
finite-size corrections departures basic wbe assumptions important context plants well shown recent studies enquist collaborators 
final analysis led seemingly incongruent conclusions many critiques wbe framework misguided exact predictions wbe model not fully supported empirical data
former means wbe framework remains once properly understood powerful perspective elucidating allometric scaling principles
latter means wbe model must become more respectful biological detail whereupon may yield predictions more closely match empirical data
our work explores how details added model what effects they
paper organized follows
sake self-contained presentation start systematic overview assumptions both explicit implicit underlying wbe theory
text s1 provide detailed exposition hydrodynamic derivations model rests upon
calculations not original but they not appeared full extent before literature
while nothing section assumptions wbe model novel there seems no single go place wbe literature lays out all components wbe theory
our paper then proceeds brief derivation exact rather than approximate relationship between metabolic rate body mass then calculate exact predictions scaling exponents networks finite size revisit certain assumptions theory
section comparison empirical data compare our results trends detectable empirical data
put forward our conclusions discussion section
