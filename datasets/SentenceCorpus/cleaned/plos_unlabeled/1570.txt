emergence areas during neural development dependent expression patterns several genes
along anterior-posterior axis gradients fgf8 emx2 pax6 coup-tfi sp8 play particularly strong role specifying areal identity
however our understanding regulatory interactions between genes lead their confinement particular spatial patterns currently qualitative incomplete
therefore used computational model interactions between five genes determine interactions combinations interactions occur networks reproduce anterior-posterior expression patterns observed experimentally
model treats expression levels boolean reflecting qualitative nature expression data currently available
simulated gene expression patterns created all formula possible networks containing five genes interest
found only formula networks were able reproduce experimentally observed expression patterns
networks all lacked certain interactions combinations interactions including auto-regulation inductive loops
many higher order combinations interactions also never appeared networks satisfied our criteria good performance
while there was remarkable diversity structure networks perform well analysis probability each interaction gave indication interactions most likely present gene network regulating cortical area development
found general repressive interactions much more likely than inductive ones but mutually repressive loops not critical correct network functioning
overall our model illuminates design principles gene network regulating cortical area development makes novel predictions tested experimentally
 introduction 
mammalian cerebral cortex complex but extremely precise structure
adult divided into several functionally distinct areas characterised different combinations gene expression specialised cytoarchitecture specific patterns input output connections
but how does functional specification arise
there strong evidence both genetic activity-dependent mechanisms play role development specialised areas process also referred arealisation
genetic component implicated spatial non-uniformity expression some genes prior thalamocortical innervation well fact altering expression some genes early development changes area position adult
other hand manipulating thalamocortical inputs hence activity thalamus alter area size respecify area identity
results accommodated current working model cortical arealisation multi-stage process where initial broad spatial patterns gene expression provide scaffold differential thalamocortical innervation
patterned activity thalamocortical inputs then drives more complex spatially restricted gene expression turn regulates further area specific differentiation
paper focuses earliest stage arealisation: how patterns gene expression form early cortical development
experiments identified many genes expressed embryonically critical positioning cortical areas adult
although arealisation occurs two-dimensional field most experiments focus anterior-posterior patterning hence here concentrate patterning along axis
around embryonic day 8 mouse morphogen fgf8 expressed at anterior pole developing telencephalon
immediately after fgf8 expression initiated mouse four transcription factors emx2 pax6 coup-tfi sp8 expressed gradients across surface cortex
four tfs appealing research target because their complementary expression gradients could provide unique coordinate system arealisation equivalent positional information
altered expression each fgf8 four tfs shifts area positions late embryonic stages adult ;
furthermore during development altered expression each genes up down-regulates expression some other genes set along anterior-posterior axis
large cohort experiments given rise hypothesised network regulatory interactions between five genes
however only one interactions been directly demonstrated no analysis been performed at systems level
interacting tfs known able form regulatory networks drive differential spatial development fulfilling role morphogens better known
feedback loops crucial feature enable generation spatial patterns expression genes network
since tfs regulate expression other genes local differences expression set tfs powerful method generating spatial patterns growth differentiation expression guidance cues developing more complex patterns gene expression
arealisation genes form regulatory network many feedback loops principle capable generating spatial patterns
establishing interactions critical correct arealisation great interest field but current experimental approaches limited their ability quickly assay importance each particular interaction
computational modelling gene regulatory networks necessary because their complex behaviour difficult understand intuitively
addition offers several other benefits
currently many hypothesised interactions between arealisation genes represented arrow diagrams like seen figure 2a
because intuition tends follow simple causal chains presence many feedback loops makes intuition about overall behaviour complex systems unreliable
consequently more formal description than arrow diagram would test current conceptual model potential give greater understanding insight done many other regulatory networks
unambiguous descriptions found mathematical computational models offer added benefit making assumptions explicit therefore allowing greater scrutiny
computational experiments also performed quickly cheaply relative laboratory experiments consequently useful conducting thought experiments then tested experimentally
way computational modelling experiments spur each other so both improved synergistic manner 
here use boolean logical approach model arealisation regulatory network
approach variables representing genes proteins take only two values zero one representing gene protein activity being below above some threshold effect
while continuous models more realistic they many free parameters hard constrain experimental data offer formidable computational challenge investigate systematically
contrast boolean models used when only qualitative expression interaction data available case arealisation
boolean models at each point time state variable depends state its regulators at previous time step
set logic equations capture regulatory relationships between variables dictate how system evolves time
boolean idealisation greatly reduces number free parameters while still capturing network dynamics producing biologically pertinent predictions insights
our model use only two spatial compartments one representing anterior pole another representing posterior pole
anterior posterior expression levels after boolean discretisation shown figure 1c
more than two expression levels more than two spatial compartments would more realistic but would result explosion number parameters currently unconstrained experimental data
having only two expression levels only two compartments allows us systematically screen large number networks would impossible more complex model
paper simulate dynamics all possible networks created different combinations interactions between fgf8 emx2 pax6 coup-tfi sp8 show only formula networks able reproduce expression patterns observed experimentally
analysis identify structural elements common best performing networks well elements never appear networks perform well
results reveal important logical principles underlying cortical arealisation gene network suggest potential directions future experimental investigations
