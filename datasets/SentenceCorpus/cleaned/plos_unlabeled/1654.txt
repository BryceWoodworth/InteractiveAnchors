article develop comprehensive framework optimal spike-based sensory integration working memory dynamic environment
propose probability distributions inferred spike-per-spike recurrently connected networks integrate-and-fire neurons
result networks combine sensory cues optimally track state time-varying stimulus memorize accumulated evidence over periods much longer than time constant single neurons
importantly propose population responses persistent working memory states represent entire probability distributions not only single stimulus values
memories reflected sustained asynchronous patterns activity make relevant information available downstream neurons within their short time window integration
model neurons act predictive encoders only firing spikes account new information not yet been signaled
thus spike times signal deterministically prediction error contrary rate codes spike times considered random samples underlying firing rate
consequence coding scheme multitude spike patterns reliably encode same information
results weakly correlated poisson-like spike trains sensitive initial conditions but robust even high levels external neural noise
spike train variability reproduces one observed cortical sensory spike trains but cannot equated noise
contrary consequence optimal spike-based inference
contrast show rate-based models perform poorly when implemented stochastically spiking neurons
 introduction 
our senses furnish us information about external world ambiguous corrupted noise
taking uncertainty into account crucial successful interaction our environment
psychophysical studies shown animals humans behave optimal bayesian observers i.e they integrate noisy sensory cues their own predictions prior beliefs order maximize expected outcome their actions 
several theoretical investigations explored neural mechanisms could underly probabilistic computations
cortical areas sensory motor variables encoded joint activity populations spiking neurons whose activity highly variable weakly correlated
timing individual spikes unreliable while spike counts approximately poisson distributed
characteristics inspired rate-based models encode probability distributions their average firing rates spike count covariances
previous studies examined analytically empirically how information encoded population code how decoded how population codes combined optimally
particular optimal cue combination reduces simple linear combination neural activities broad family neural variability including poisson gaussian noise 
however most studies neglect crucial dimension perception: time
most sensory stimuli vary dynamically natural environment requires sensory representations constructed integrated combined on-line
perceptual inference thus cannot based rates spike counts measured during fixed temporal window used most previous population coding frameworks
at same time reliable decisions typically require integration sensory evidence over hundreds milliseconds largely exceeds integrative time constant single neurons
unclear how leaky devices could compute sums spike counts typical time scale perceptual motor tasks
problem even more crucial if decision delayed compared presentation sensory information
sensory variables direction motion stimulus retained working memory significant periods time even absence sensory input
neural correlates working memory appear persistent neural activity parietal frontal brain areas exhibit firing statistics similar those found sensory responses
persistent activity been modeled stable state recurrent neural network dynamics
however attractors correspond stereotyped patterns activity only represent single stimulus value
example memorized position object encoded position stable bump activity
would imply though information about reliability memorized cue lost cannot used delayed cue combination decision making
hypothesize instead stimuli memorized same format sensory input i.e probability distribution
question how probability distributions memorized population neurons remains largely unanswered
here approach issues using new interpretation population coding context temporal sensory integration
consider spikes rather than rates basic unit probabilistic representation
show how recurrent networks leaky integrate-and-fire neurons construct combine memorize probability distributions dynamic sensory variables
spike generation neurons results competition between integration evidence feed-forward sensory inputs prediction lateral connections
neuron therefore acts predictive encoder only spiking if its input cannot predicted its own its neighbors' past activity
demonstrate networks integrate combine sensory inputs optimally i.e without losing information track stimulus dynamics spike-per-spike even absence sensory input over timescales much longer than neural time constants
framework thus provides first comprehensive theory optimal spike-based sensory integration working memory
contrast rate models implemented poisson spiking neurons model does not require large levels redundancy compensate noise added stochastic spike generation
similar cortical sensory neurons model neurons respond sustained asynchronous spiking activity
spike times variable uncorrelated despite deterministic spike generation rule
however contrast rate codes each spike counts
trial trial variability spike trains does not reflect intrinsic source noise requires averaging but consequence predictive coding
while spike times unpredictable at level single neuron they deterministically represent probability distribution at level population
leads us reinterpret notions signal noise cortical neural responses
