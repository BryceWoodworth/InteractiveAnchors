 introduction 
alpha-helical transmembrane proteins constitute roughly 30 percent proteins encoded typical genome involved wide variety important biological processes including cell signalling transport membrane-impermeable molecules cell recognition
many also prime drug targets been estimated more than half all drugs currently market target membrane proteins
despite significant efforts predict tm protein topology comparatively little attention been directed toward developing method pack helices together
since membrane-spanning region predominantly composed alpha-helices common alignment task should principle easier than predicting fold globular proteins longitudinal constraints helix packing mostly reduces solution space three dimensions two
however topologies consisting large numbers tm helices well structural features including re-entrant tilted kinked helices render simple approaches may work regularly packed proteins unable predict diverse packing arrangements now present structural databases
early attempts predict tm protein folds were based sequence similarity proteins known three-dimensional structure using statistically derived environmental preference parameters combined experimentally determined features
another method calculated amino acid substitution tables residues membrane proteins where side chain was accessible lipid
comparing observed substitutions obtained sequence alignments tm regions accessibility residues lipid could predicted
combination fourier transform method detect alpha-helices buried exposed faces could then discriminated presence charged residues used construct three-dimensional model
other methods also made use exposed surface prediction allocate helix positions combination existing framework globular protein structure prediction involving combinatorial enumeration windings over predefined architecture followed selection preferred folds
however methods were only suitable 7 tm helix bundles rhodopsin were unsuitable other topologies
more recently modified version fragment-based protein tertiary structure prediction method fragfold was modified model tm proteins
fragfold based assembly super-secondary structural fragments using simulated annealing algorithm order narrow search conformational space pre-selecting fragments library highly resolved protein structures
film added membrane potential fragfold energy terms was derived statistical analysis data set tm proteins experimentally defined topologies
results obtained applying method small membrane proteins known three-dimensional structure showed could predict both helix topology conformation at reasonable accuracy level
despite good results combinatorial complexity ab initio protein folding methods means unfeasible use approaches large tm structures many longer than 150 residues
modification another globular protein ab initio modelling program rosetta added energy function described membrane intra-protein interactions at atomic level membrane protein/lipid interactions implicitly while treating hydrogen bonds explicitly
results suggest model captures essential physical properties govern solvation stability tm proteins allowing structures small protein domains up 150 residues predicted successfully resolution less than 2.5
recent enhancement algorithm demonstrated constraining helix-helix packing arrangements at particular positions based local sequence-structure correlations each helix interface independently tm proteins more complex topologies could modelled within 4 native structure 
prediction helix-helix interactions derived residue contacts topology only recently been investigated tm proteins due relative paucity tm protein crystal structures
contrast number globular protein contact predictors exist based variety machine learning algorithms contact prediction also been used assess globular protein models submitted critical assessment structure prediction experiment
however analysis shown globular proteins contact predictors perform poorly when applied tm proteins most likely due differences between tm globular interaction motifs
number studies identified structural sequence motifs recurring frequently during helix helix interaction tm proteins
one investigation analysed interacting helical pairs according their three-dimensional similarity allowing three quarters pairs grouped into one five tightly clustered motifs
largest consisted anti-parallel motif left-handed packing angles stabilised packing small side chains every seven residues while right-handed parallel anti-parallel structures showed similar tendency though spaced at four-residue intervals
another study identified specific aromatic pattern aromatic-xx-aromatic was demonstrated stabilise helix-helix interactions during assembly while others include gxxxg motif found glycophorin heptad motifs leucine residues polar residues through formation hydrogen bonds 
discovery recurring motifs likelihood there more yet undiscovered suggests predictability generalised pattern search strategy
recently two methods been developed attempt predict residue contacts helix-helix interaction
tmhcon uses neural network combination profile data residue co-evolution information predicted lipid exposure using lips method number tm protein specific features residue position within tm helix order predict helix-helix interaction
tmhit uses two-level hierarchical approach combination support vector machine classifier
first level discriminates between contacts non-contacts per residue basis before second level determines structure contact map all possible pairs predicted contact residues therefore avoiding high computational cost incurred quadratic growth residue pair prediction
here present novel method predict lipid exposure residue contacts helix-helix interactions finally optimal helical packing arrangements tm proteins
using molecular dynamics data label residues potentially exposed lipid trained cross-validated svm classifier predict per residue lipid exposure 69 percent accuracy
information combined psi-blast profile data variety sequence-based features train additional svm predict residue contacts
combining results priori topology information able predict helix-helix interaction up 65 percent accuracy under stringent cross-validation non-redundant test set 74 protein chains
then tested ability method discriminate native decoy helical packing arrangement using decoy set 2811 structures
comparing our predictions test set were able identify native packing arrangement up 70 percent accuracy
all performance metrics represents significant improvements over existing methods
order visualise global packing arrangement adopted graph-based approach
employing force-directed algorithm method attempts minimise edge crossing while maintaining uniform edge length attributes common native structures
finally genetic algorithm used rotate helices order prevent residue contacts occurring across longitudinal helix axis
