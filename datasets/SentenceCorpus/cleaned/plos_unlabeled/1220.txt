using our new approach show purkinje cell prcs change qualitatively depending firing frequency cell
at high firing rates purkinje cells exhibit single-peaked monophasic prcs
surprisingly at low firing rates purkinje cell prcs largely independent phase resembling prcs ideal non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons

 introduction 
cerebellar purkinje cells exhibit wide range dynamical phenomena
they intrinsic neural oscillators firing spontaneously highly rhythmically absence synaptic input at rate 10 180 hz
they also exhibit intrinsic bistability influences their responses sensory stimulation
addition interactions between spontaneously firing purkinje cells result waves activity travelling down cerebellar folia high frequency oscillations may contribute generation precise temporal patterns cerebellar network
hence firing purkinje cells highly time state-dependent thus they represent excellent targets dynamical systems analysis
