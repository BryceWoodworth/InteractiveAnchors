 introduction 
cellular signal transduction exhibits two layers regulation: upstream stimuli extracellular peptide hormones activate intracellular signaling intermediates turn induce intracellular responses indicated figure 1a
type regulation usually operates time scale minutes will termed fast regulation paper
fast regulation involves posttranslational modification pre-existing protein pools order transduce signals nucleus
responses induced fast regulation activated transcription factors often turn alter total abundance their own activators intermediates heterologous cascades e.g owing induced mrna/protein synthesis degradation
example signal transduction pathways immune system alter concentration their own constituents transcriptional positive negative feedback bring about sensitization desensitization
likewise cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling affects heterologous mitogenic cascades via transcriptional crosstalk inducing mkp-1 phosphatase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
owing long half-lives most mrnas proteins type regulation operates time scale hours most cases thus will referred slow regulation here
figure 1a shows simplified view signal transduction: upstream stimuli hormones induce gene expression turn alters cellular signal processing
previous theoretical experimental studies mainly analyzed how fast regulation influences slow regulation while downstream effects i.e impact slow regulation fast regulation less well investigated
however slow regulation probably equally important since expression phosphoproteins altered during variety physiological processes differentiation development apoptosis long-term potentiation cell cycle circadian rhythm
furthermore deregulated expression wild-type phosphoproteins been shown correlated diseases diabetes cancer 
at first glance one may expect altered expression intermediate 1 affects steady-state signal transmission via intermediate 1 linear fashion
however recent research suggests strong nonlinearity observed at least some cases: variety tumor-suppressor genes involved cellular signal transduction do not follow knudson's two-hit hypothesis i.e they do not require homozygotic loss both alleles support tumor progression
instead loss single copy i.e halving protein expression sufficient abrogate tumor-suppressor function phenomenon been termed haploinsufficiency
suggests expression signaling proteins affects signal transmission highly switch-like fashion
increased signal transmission elicited transcriptional induction been referred sensitization ultrasensitive regulation will referred here ultrasensitization
available experimental data suggest ultrasensitization physiologically advantageous: receptor-tyrosine kinases elicit different cellular responses known induce broadly overlapping sets immediate early genes although amplitude immediate early gene-induction receptor-specific
ultrasensitization allows cells discriminate minor differences immediate early gene expression thus confers specificity receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling
addition even saturating hormone concentrations induce/repress vast majority target mrnas less than 10-fold
thus stimulus-response hormone-induced transcription exhibits significant basal activation so mrna induction relatively insensitive towards extracellular hormone concentrations
cases ultrasensitization dramatically increase cellular effects extracellular hormone administration may help establish all-or-none cell-fate decisions
finally strong nonlinearities ultrasensitization known contribute bistability oscillations noise reduction cellular heterogeneity 
phosphorylation most common mode eukaryotic information transfer been estimated one third all cellular proteins phosphorylated
several haploinsufficient tumor suppressors encode phosphoproteins phosphatases were interested whether ultrasensitization occur simple phosphorylation dephosphorylation cycle
show here pronounced ultrasensitization possible experimentally measured kinetic constants particularly parameter range where substrate enzyme ratio majority substrate subject phosphorylation sequestered catalyzing enzymes
furthermore show coordinated transcription multiple proteins within kinase cascade result even more pronounced ultrasensitization
finally demonstrate ultrasensitization account specificity modularity regulation cellular signal transduction
