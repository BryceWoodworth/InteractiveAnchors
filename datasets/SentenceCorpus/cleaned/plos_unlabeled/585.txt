 
numerous studies noted evolution new enzymatic specificities accompanied loss protein's thermodynamic stability thus suggesting tradeoff between acquisition new enzymatic functions stability
however since most mutations destabilizing one should ask how destabilizing mutations confer new altered enzymatic functions relative all other mutations
applied g computations foldx analyze effects 548 mutations arose directed evolution 22 different enzymes
stability effects location type function-altering mutations were compared g changes arising all possible point mutations same enzymes
found mutations modulate enzymatic functions mostly destabilizing almost destabilizing average mutation enzymes
although their stability effects not dramatic key catalytic residues mutations modify substrate binding pockets thus mediate new enzymatic specificities place larger stability burden than surface mutations underline neutral non-adaptive evolutionary changes
how destabilizing effects functional mutations balanced enable adaptation
our analysis also indicated many mutations appear directed evolution variants no obvious role new function exert stabilizing effects may compensate destabilizing effects crucial function-altering mutations
thus evolution new enzymatic activities both nature laboratory dependent compensatory stabilizing effect apparently silent mutations regions protein irrelevant its function
 introduction 
exception unstructured protein domains integrity protein's structure function largely dependent its thermodynamic stability
evolutionary processes they neutral adaptive involve acquisition mutations may affect protein function and/or stability
example mutation endows desirable new function but severely undermines stability will not become fixed
relationship between mutational effects function stability therefore crucial our understanding not only evolutionary dynamics proteins but also engineering designing evolving novel enzymes laboratory 
stability-function tradeoffs became originally evident enzymes particularly structural tension created arrangement catalytic residues active sites
point view overall protein stability active site organization inherently unfavorable number reasons
functional residues generally polar charged embedded hydrophobic clefts sometimes proximal like charges
key catalytic residues often possess unfavorable backbone angles
consequently substitution enzyme's key catalytic side chains dramatically increase stability whilst obviously sacrificing activity 
observations led generally accepted principle stability-function tradeoffs was later extended tradeoffs between new functions stability
however discussed below surmise there exists fundamental difference between mutations key catalytic residues relate well established stability-function tradeoff mutations mediate evolutionary divergence new functions
enzymes evolve new functions via mutations alter substrate specificity typically increasing affinity rates weak promiscuous substrates
changes involve mutational adjustments active site its periphery even second third shell residues surround while maintaining key catalytic residues intact
shown below oppose mutations key catalytic residues typically involve exchange into alanine charged/polar residue within hydrophobic surroundings type location new function mutations far more diverse
initially observed wang et al most mutations confer new functions been proven destabilizing
however generality stability-function tradeoffs regard new functions should addressed view fact regardless their relevance function most mutations destabilizing
indeed derivation g distributions all possible mutations series globular proteins using experimentally validated foldx algorithm indicated about 70 percent mutations destabilizing 20 percent significantly destabilizing
other hand mutations characterize neutral non-adaptive changes occur primarily surface certainly at first steps sequence divergence subgroup mutations much less destabilizing average g 0.6 kcal/mol
thus better understanding how emergence new functions trades-off protein stability requires comparison mutations confer new protein functions all other possible mutations protein well mutations characterize neutral non-adaptive changes
mind investigated large set mutations were found enzymes acquired new substrate specificities directed evolution experiments clinical isolates
applied foldx compute g values mutations compared type location g values mutations all possible point mutations same proteins
while realizing foldx values prediction limited accuracy they do enable examination distributions g values large set proteins mutations whole predictions show reasonable correlation experimental data
thus whilst values individual mutations considerably deviate experimental values trends observed likely relevant
