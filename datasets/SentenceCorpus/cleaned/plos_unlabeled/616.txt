 
progress understanding brain mechanisms underlying vision requires construction computational models not only emulate brain's anatomy physiology but ultimately match its performance visual tasks
recent years natural images become popular study vision been used show apparently impressive progress building models
here challenge use uncontrolled natural images guiding progress
particular show simple v1-like model neuroscientist's null model should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems standard ostensibly natural image recognition test
counterpoint designed simpler recognition test better span real-world variation object pose position scale show test correctly exposes inadequacy v1-like model
taken together results demonstrate tests based uncontrolled natural images seriously misleading potentially guiding progress wrong direction
instead reexamine what means images natural argue renewed focus core problem object recognition real-world image variation
 introduction 
visual object recognition extremely difficult computational problem
core problem each object world cast infinite number different 2-d images onto retina object's position pose lighting background vary relative viewer
yet brain solves problem effortlessly
progress understanding brain's solution object recognition requires construction artificial recognition systems ultimately aim emulate our own visual abilities often biological inspiration
computational approaches critically important because they provide experimentally testable hypotheses because instantiation working recognition system represents particularly effective measure success understanding object recognition
however major challenge assessing recognition performance models
ideally artificial systems should able do what our own visual systems but unclear how evaluate progress toward goal
practice amounts choosing image set against test performance
although controversial popular recent approach study vision use natural images part because they ostensibly capture essence problems encountered real world
example computational vision caltech101 image set emerged gold standard testing natural object recognition performance
set consists large number images divided into 101 object categories plus additional background category
while number specific concerns been raised set its images still currently widely used neuroscientists both theoretical experimental contexts
logic caltech101 sheer number categories diversity those images place high bar object recognition systems require them solve computational crux object recognition
because there 102 object categories chance performance less than 1 percent correct
recent years several object recognition models shown what appears impressively high performance test better than 60 percent correct suggesting approaches while still well below human performance at least heading right direction
however argue here caution not clear what extent natural image tests actually engage core problem object recognition
specifically while caltech101 set certainly contains large number images variations object view position size etc between within object category poorly defined not varied systematically
furthermore image backgrounds strongly covary object category
majority images also composed photographs human decided how shot should framed thus placement objects within image not random set may not properly reflect variation found real world
furthermore if caltech101 object recognition task hard not easy know what makes hard different kinds variation all inextricably mixed together
problems not unique caltech101 set but also apply other uncontrolled natural image sets
