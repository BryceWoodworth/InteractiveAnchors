 
natural proteins often partake several highly specific protein-protein interactions
they thus subject multiple opposing forces during evolutionary selection
functional multispecific proteins need stable complex each interaction partner at same time maintain affinity toward all partners
how multispecificity acquired through natural evolution
answer compelling question study prototypical multispecific protein calmodulin evolved interact hundreds target proteins
starting high-resolution structures sixteen cam-target complexes employ state-of-the-art computational methods predict hundred cam sequences best suited interaction each individual cam target
then design cam sequences most compatible each possible combination two three all sixteen targets simultaneously producing almost 70,000 low energy cam sequences
comparing sequences their energies gain insight into how nature managed find compromise between need favorable interaction energies need multispecificity
observe designing more partners simultaneously yields cam sequences better match natural sequence profiles thus emphasizing importance strategies nature
furthermore show cam binding interface nicely partitioned into positions critical affinity all cam-target complexes those molded provide interaction specificity
reveal several basic categories sequence-level tradeoffs enable compromise necessary promiscuity protein
also thoroughly quantify tradeoff between interaction energetics multispecificity find facilitating seemingly competing interactions requires only small deviation optimal energies
conclude multispecific proteins been subjected rigorous optimization process fine-tuned their sequences interactions precise set targets thus conferring their multiple cellular functions
 introduction 
proteins engage numerous protein-protein interactions together regulate outcome all biological processes cell
some estimates over third all mammalian proteins participate two more highly specific protein-protein interactions
proteins interact large number partners play central role modular organization protein interaction networks
proteins usually referred protein hubs tend more essential than others cell survival usually exhibit slower rates evolution
moreover comprehensive biological activity proteins typically requires them recognize precise set targets specific way
example each subfamily g protein regulators interacts only specific subset g proteins
proteins diverse binding capacity also been termed multispecific proteins 
central function multispecific proteins within interaction networks imposes constraints their amino acid sequences especially their protein-protein interfaces i.e regions used mediate intermolecular interactions various targets
there exist only few studies characterized great detail molecular structural features multispecific protein interfaces ; mostly due sparse representation protein-protein complexes protein data bank
thorough understanding atomic-level principles governing multispecific interactions extremely important not only advancement basic science but also design new pharmaceuticals modify protein-protein interactions
furthermore molecular insights will provide critical feedback systems biology research views protein-protein interactions high-level network approach 
calmodulin paradigm multispecific protein more than three hundred cam targets identified date
cam central player formula signaling pathways control gene transcription protein phosphorylation nucleotide metabolism ion transport
formula sensor protein translates changes formula concentration into activity many downstream targets including kinases phosphatases enzymes ion channels
remarkably cam targets display considerable variability sequence structure
cam-binding regions within target proteins generally rich hydrophobic positively charged residues
nevertheless no consensus cam-binding sequence exists all cam target proteins
recent structural studies revealed there several binding modes accessible cam allowing protein interact its targets formula-saturated state partially-saturated formula state formula-free state
formula-saturated form cam usually binds stretch formula amino acids unfolded absence cam becomes helical upon interaction protein
conventional binding mode cam undergoes conformational change embraces target helix its two globular domains burying substantial hydrophobic surface area providing favorable hydrogen bond salt bridge interactions target
formula-saturated cam binds its targets high affinity displaying formula values formula formula m range
affinity reduced at least 1000-fold absence formula allowing quick dissociation cam its targets when formula depleted
multitude binding constraints placed cam during evolution likely produced sequence may not optimal binding any particular cam target but rather presents compromise essential interaction large number partners
study employ computational design approach understand how compromises required functional promiscuity achieved both level amino acid sequences level binding energetics
first computationally evolve cam interact single targets; second evolve protein bind multiple partners simultaneously
recently similar analysis was performed twenty multispecific proteins whose interactions two seven targets were considered
contrast those works report much more comprehensive investigation single multispecific protein cam
examine interactions sixteen different cam-target complexes exhibit conventional binding mode
using structures complexes perform 697 separate cam design calculations obtain formula low energy cam sequences optimal either single target some combination targets
rigorous quantitative statistical comparisons designed cam sequences their energies allows us draw conclusions regarding cam evolution suggest strategies design binders both promiscuous yet highly specific
particular characterize cam binding interface partitioning its residues into those critical binding affinity those important multispecificity
furthermore analyze sorts sequence compromises required yield proteins promiscuous interactions show how fits past explanations ability cam accommodate many targets
finally examine energetic compromises inherently crucial multispecificity find our results also shed light unexpected findings previous experimental protein design research
