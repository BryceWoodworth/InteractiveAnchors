sumoylation e2 ligase ubc9 function without e3 enzymes albeit lower reaction efficiency
here study mechanism through e3 ligase ranbp2 triggers target recognition catalysis e2 ubc9
two mechanisms were proposed sumoylation
while both first step involves ubc9 conjugation sumo subsequent sequence events differs: first e2-sumo forms complex target e3 followed sumo transfer target
second ubc9-sumo binds target facilitates sumo transfer without e3
using dynamic correlations obtained explicit solvent molecular dynamic simulations illustrate key roles played allostery both mechanisms
pre-existence conformational states explains experimental observations sumoylation occur without e3 even though at reduced rate
furthermore propose mechanism enhancement sumoylation e3
analysis conformational ensembles complex e2 conjugated sumo illustrates e2 enzyme already largely pre-organized target binding catalysis; e3 binding shifts equilibrium enhances pre-existing populations
further observe e3 binding regulates allosterically key residues e2 ubc9 asp100/lys101 e2 target recognition

simplicity below sumo refers sumo-1
at least 100 different proteins been reported targets sumoylation
analogous conjugation mechanisms ub/ubls sumo attached target proteins following sequential activation e1 e2 most cases e3 enzymes
following activation sumo precursor e1 enzyme aos1/uba2 sumo form thioester bond
sumo thioester next transferred active cysteine ubc9 single known e2 enzyme sumoylation pathway
then sumo transferred e2 target protein lysine residue
e3 enzymes ensure target specificity increase reaction efficiency usually mediate step
among sumoylation targets rangap1 p53 i b modified without e3 ligase vitro although reaction rates slower compared e3-mediated conjugation
e2 ligase ubc9 essential conserved
recognizes consensus sumoylation motif k-x-d/e where represents hydrophobic residue k sumo acceptor lysine x any amino acid d/e acidic residue
e2 ligase also interacts e3 enzymes during transfer sumo targets
addition consensus sumoylation motif sumoylation target rangap1 second contact surface e2 ligase ubc9 thought responsible higher efficiency modification compared other substrates
fragment e3 enzyme ranbp2 consisting ir1-m-ir2 domains sufficient e3 activity vivo vitro
moreover ir1-m m-ir2 constructs also functional ir1-m being catalytic core domain
activity e3 fragment indicates e3 exerts its catalytic effect altering structural properties e2-sumo complex increasing affinity complex specific protein targets rather than forming direct target interactions
crystal structure sumo-rangap1-ubc9-ranbp2 complex supports idea
recent work also shows e3 ligase ranbp2 prevents dissociation sumo its target rangap1 leading increase sumoylated rangap1 levels
due strong interactions between rangap1 e2 been debated question whether ranbp2 exerts its e3 activity rangap1 whether only maintains complex at nuclear pore complex 
our aim understand mechanism through e3 ligase ranbp2 triggers target recognition catalysis e2 sumoylation
carried out explicit solvent molecular dynamic simulations e2 ligase ubc9 sumo e2-sumo complex without e3 enzyme ranbp2
modeled conjugated e2-sumo complex ranbp2 bound unbound forms based sumo-rangap1-ubc9-ranbp2 crystal structure
our results indicate e3 binding induces higher population target binding catalysis-ready e2 restricting conformational space e2-sumo complex
observe ranbp2 binding enhances correlations between fluctuations e2 residues involved catalytic activity target recognition implies ranbp2 indeed e3 ligase sumoylation target protein rangap1
our results further lead us propose mechanism through e3 ligase ranbp2 triggers e2 target recognition catalysis sumoylation allostery: ranbp2 allosteric effector e2 ligase ubc9
