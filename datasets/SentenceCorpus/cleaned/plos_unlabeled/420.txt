 introduction 
membrane fusion plays key role cellular function allowing processes diverse neurotransmitter release secretion peptide hormones infection enveloped viruses
fusion also critical allowing intracellular transport
cellular membranes participating fusion reactions contain complex mixtures lipids proteins
composition potentially organization mixtures both variable closely regulated cell 
variety experimental computational model systems been used gain insight into basic physical properties underlying membrane fusion
model systems necessity much simpler nature than physiologic context fusion containing one few lipid species omitting simplifying protein environment
designing interpreting model systems fusion important consider how variations lipid mixtures chosen may affect results
investigating how changes lipid composition affect kinetics mechanism fusion also provides fundamental insight illuminating aspects fusion robust small perturbations model system used highly model-dependent
experimental data lipid vesicle fusion indicate variation lipid composition plays important role determining fusogenicity
much initial work concentrated effects fusion lipids prefer either positive negative membrane curvature
perhaps most extensively characterized association between increased fusogenicity increased fraction phosphatidylethanolamine lipid headgroup thought promote negative membrane curvature
plasma membranes fusogenic contexts ratio phosphatidylcholine pe headgroups measured at between 0.9 2.0
presence pe been identified critical factor fusion many systems used develop structural models fusion intermediates contain substantially higher proportion pe than physiologic levels
similarly theoretical treatments proposed fusion intermediates suggest pe important energetic favorability stalk-like state been proposed early fusion intermediate
other lipid species likely play additional modulatory role fusion pc:pe ratio physiological membranes also varies independently inner outer leaflets
work examine effect pc:pe ratio first-order approximation lipid composition effects; first treat uniform composition inner outer membrane leaflets then examine asymmetric compositions
membrane curvature long been believed important modulator fusion process
simply conceived curvature strain highly curved membrane provide driving force reduces energetic barrier fusion process
most physiological fusion occurs between membranes relatively large radius curvature even concave relative fusion site
however local curvature at site fusion been subject much discussion several theories positing membrane protrusion high local curvature at site fusion
recent experimental evidence suggests synaptotagmin one neuronal fusion proteins preferentially binds curved membranes induces tubulation model membranes diameter 17.5 nm accelerates vesicle fusion rates 
important finding provides more direct evidence highly curved membrane structures simulate here may play important role physiological fusion induction curvature may major function fusion protein apparatus
possibility physiological fusion may involve highly curved membranes raises questions what degree curvature required fusion how curvature may differentially affect formation stability fusion intermediates
here report initial results regard; refer reader forthcoming work lee schick more extensive investigation phenomenon field-theoretic perspective 
because structures detailed kinetics fusion intermediates difficult observe experimentally computational simulations fusion play important role generating detailed structural kinetic models fusion consistent available experimental data
coarse-grained simulations allow substantial increase computational tractability at expense some fidelity experiment; degree fidelity varies particular approximations made constructing model
lipid model developed marrink mark provides quantitative approximation experimentally observable lipid parameters area per head group diffusion bilayer width represents good compromise between computational tractability level atomistic detail
initial results reported membrane fusion model demonstrate fusogenicity 15 nm vesicles composed either pure palmitoyloleoyl-pe dipalmitoyl-pc:dipalmitoyl-pe mixture also observing faster fusion pore formation dppc:dppe mixture than pure pope
simulated pure dppc vesicles were not observed form fusion pores
subsequent work used marrink-mark coarse-grained model systematically predict intermediates kinetics fusion small pope vesicles
our simulations suggested branching fusion pathway vesicles first react form stalk-like intermediate but then either rapidly form fusion pore stalk-like state fuse via intermediate expanded hemifusion diaphragm metastable microsecond timescale
previous theoretical work suggested two pathways alternative hypotheses; predicted pathways may coexist within single system
our initial report predicted pure pope vesicles react via both pathways but primarily undergo fusion via late-hemifused intermediate using indirect pathway
now extend model address how more complex mixtures lipids may affect reaction mechanism kinetics fusion
physiologic membrane fusion takes place membranes consisting complex likely inhomogeneous mixture multiple lipid species proteins
experimental computational model systems fusion far simpler containing well-defined lipid mixtures; case computational studies single-component membranes routinely used
given gap complexity between model systems used mechanistic studies fusion physiologic situation they meant reproduce wish understand how fusion mechanisms properties depend membrane composition
therefore performed thousands simulations vesicle fusion at different lipid compositions systematically predict how membrane fusion kinetics intermediates depend lipid composition
