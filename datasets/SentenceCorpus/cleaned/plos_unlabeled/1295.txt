era where expanding protein structure library complements abundant protein sequence data need high-throughput validation our approach provides insight into newest toxin adp-ribosyltransferases
 introduction 
sequence data over 6,500 genome projects available through genomes online database more than 60,000 protein structures protein data bank
while sequences represent large diversity limited number possible folds estimated at 1,700 helps researchers organize sequences structure
single fold performs limited number functions between 1.2 1.8 average
therefore structure knowledge helps pinpoint function
researchers combining sequence structure data expand protein families mono-adp-ribosyltransferase protein toxins participate human diseases including diphtheria cholera whooping cough 
adp-ribosylation post-translational modification plays role many settings
adp-ribosyltransferases bind nad covalently transfer single poly adp-ribose macromolecule target usually protein changing its activity
many prokaryotic adprt toxins damage host cells mono-adp-ribosylating intracellular targets
g-proteins common targets including: eukaryotic elongation factor 2 elongation factor thermo unstable ras rho gs
other targets include actin kinase regulators rna-recognition motifs 
researchers use adprt toxins develop vaccines drug targets kill cancer cells stent coatings prevent restenosis after angioplasty insecticides deliver foreign proteins into cells using toxin receptor-binding membrane translocation domains study cell biology understand adp-ribosylation reaction identify biosecurity risks
adprts occur viruses prokaryotes archaea eukaryotes
genomes acquire them through horizontal gene transfer
several authors reviewed prokaryotic adprt family
examples include pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme s vibrio cholerae cholera toxin bordetella pertussis pertussis toxin corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin
toxic adprts divided into ct dt groups better organize family
focus ct group divide into exos-like c2-like c3-like ct-pt-like toxins
ct group primary sequences related through specific structure-linked pattern
adprt pattern updated previous reports written regular expression is:formula
toxin catalytic domain consists several regions
describe them here going n c-terminus using previously introduced nomenclature
region sometimes present recognizes substrate when exot recognizes crk example
its recognition exot targets exception rather than general rule adprts
except ct-pt-like subgroup region b active site loop flanked two helices appears early toxin sequence
stabilizes catalytic glu binds nicotinamide ribose adenine phosphate
also stabilizes target substrate helps specific bonds rotate during adprt reaction turn helping bring nucleophile electrophile together reaction
region 1 at end sheet sequence pattern yfl rx
important binding a-phosphate nicotinamide phosphate nicotinamide adenine ribose target substrate
region f follows region 1 sometimes recognizes substrate
region 2 follows sheet sequence pattern yf x-s-t sqt
binds adenine positions catalytic glu orients adp-ribosyl-turn-turn loop maintains active site integrity
phosphate-nicotinamide loop immediately after sts motif
interacts target binds n-phosphate
menetrey et al suggested pn loop flexible implicated locking nicotinamide place during reaction
region 3 consists artt loop leading into sheet pattern qe x-e
recognizes stabilizes target binds n-ribose create strained nad conformation
artt loop plastic having both out forms might aid substrate recognition
fas region mediates activator binding when present 
researchers long debated adprt reaction details
some suggest s n2 mechanism but many now favor s n1 mechanism
tsuge et al recently devised specific version mechanism iota toxin follow closely work
reaction follows three steps: toxin cleaves nicotinamide form oxacarbenium ion oxacarbenium o 5d-p n bond rotates relieve strain forms second ionic intermediate
finally target makes nucleophilic attack second ionic intermediate
s n1mechansim believed widely applicable ct group toxins template new toxins given historical structure similarity consistent nad conformation active site shown figures 1 2
quaternary structure toxins wide-ranging
several combinations exist toxin domains receptor binding membrane translocation domains
b domains diverse structures functions exist fusions separate polypeptides
various formats include: a-only two-domain ab three-domain ab ab 5
c3-like toxins a-only
exos-like toxins toxic a-domains often paired rho gtpase activating protein not true b domains
c2-like toxins ab toxins contain b domains structural duplicates domain
b domains not toxins they bind proteins similar anthrax protective antigen including vip1 c2-ii iota ib
dt group toxins three-domain single polypeptide ab toxins where b domain contains both receptor-binding membrane-translocation domain
ct-pt-like toxins ab 5 b domains form receptor-binding pentamer 
low overall sequence identity hampers conventional sequence-based homology searches
one challenge key filling gaps toxin family link new sequences known toxins
depending only amino acid sequence alignment techniques discover new toxins imprudent
instead trend use more structure information search because many primary sequences produce same fold
researchers then link sequences through fold recognition 
otto et al used psi-blast identify new adprt toxins including spvb salmonella enterica
more recently similar strategy yielded 20 potential new toxins
led interesting examples later characterized including: cards toxin mycoplasma pneumonia spya streptococcus pyogenes hopu1 pseudomonas syringae 
psi-blast classic way expand protein families but limits
example unrelated sequences often capture search
also nearly decade passed since pallen et al released last detailed data mining results toxin family
sequence structure databases remote homolog detection tools advanced during time
masignani et al proposed match between conserved adprt pattern corresponding secondary structure one way reduce dependence sequence identity
pattern helps ensure function reduces total sequence set smaller subset screening secondary structure prediction ensures key active site parts present 
our contribution expand adprt toxin family using new approach
difference use fold-recognition searches extensively rather than relying psi-blast secondary structure prediction
our genomic data mining combines pattern structure-based searches
bioinformatics toolset allows us discover new toxins classify rank them assess their structure function
often data mining studies simply present table hits aligned sequences but do not interpret analyze those hits detail
our aim rather than explicitly confirm roles six proteins 15 domains 18 loops 120 residues discussed develop theoretical framework understanding new toxins based 100s 1000s jobs per sequence
intend our silico approach guide complement rather than replace follow-up vitro vivo studies
here extract features patterns known adprt toxins explain how they fit new toxins
use silico methods probe structure secretion cell entry activation nad substrate binding intracellular target binding reaction mechanism
computer approach fitting several reasons
environment safe way study new toxins
challenges cloning expressing purifying crystallizing often prevent vitro characterization
also adprts abundant within bacterial genomes researchers make sequences available faster than conduct biochemical studies
new toxins might play role current outbreaks also excellent drug targets against antibiotic resistance
our new study design expands family 15 percent 
cell-based validation complements our silico approach
use saccharomyces cerevisiae model host study toxin effects
increasingly researchers turning yeast study bacterial toxins
yeast easy grow well-characterized genetics conserved mammals cellular processes including: dna rna metabolism signalling cytoskeletal dynamics vesicle trafficking cell cycle control programmed cell death
place toxin genes under control copper-inducible promoter test putative toxins adp-ribosyltransferase activity live cells
growth-defective phenotype clearly shows toxicity
substitutions catalytic signature residues confirms adp-ribosyltransferase activity causes toxicity
indeed pairing silico cell-based studies helps identify characterize new adprt toxins
