one best studied processes at molecular level relevant stress tolerance heat shock response genus mytilus
focus upstream region mytilus galloprovincialis hsp90 genes their structural functional associations using comparative genomics network inference
sequence comparison region provides novel evidence transcription hsp90 regulated via dense region transcription factor binding sites also containing region similarity gamera family line-like repetitive sequences genus-specific element unknown function

 introduction 
majority molluscan species go through two principal developmental phases larval embryo followed clumping structure when they permanently attached underwater substrate
lifecycle common amongst marine invertebrates poses challenges adaptation tolerance wide range conditions at littoral zone including steep salinity temperature gradients
key model organisms molluscan biology include species genus mytilus particular m edulis m galloprovincialis m californianus
crucially latter species target organism genome sequencing project whose results eagerly expected community 
mytilus species group provides ideal model both fundamental questions animal adaptation stress response well biotechnological applications primarily pollution biosensor
its use extends into biomimetics particular protein-based medical adhesives potential applications fields dentistry
moreover its relatively complex developmental structure higher taxonomic status invertebrate combined fact suffer mussel haemic neoplasia renders organism potential model human leukemia ideal biomarker pollution-induced disease
context important understand mechanisms mussels tolerate cope environmental stress given their behavioral options highly restricted due sessile phase their lifecycle
past comparisons between motility sessility higher organisms been primarily confined animals versus plants follow-up studies focusing comparisons between large animals e.g humans versus large plants e.g trees trade-offs tree body plan
less attention been paid adaptations sessile animals particular intertidal invertebrates molecular mechanisms through they achieve tolerance stress
one exception represented heat shock response key factor temperature adaptation been studied context certain extent specifically mytilus regard hsp70 hsp90 genes
transcriptional regulation achieved either extensive repertoire paralogs transcription factors complex structure promoters
analysis comprehensive datasets clearly demonstrated transcription factors transcription-associated proteins not universally distributed but highly taxon-specific relative tf gene content increases taxonomic scale
comparisons been later extended follow-up studies analyzed tap complements their expansion rates plants
thus now known one way plants sessile organisms par excellence achieve finer degree regulation expansion tf/tap complements gene content strategy
yet unclear whether similar trends followed sessile animals since entire genome sequences those lacking so far limiting range comparative genome-wide studies performed
far paralogs concerned recent studies focused heat shock response plants particular arabidopsis thaliana revealed process involves up 21 known tfs four heat shock protein families
despite cursory resemblance mammals drosophila thermal sensing achieved unique repertoire genes including thermostat systems not exclusively involving heat shock proteins
other words probably different reasons gene content strategy might prevail both model organisms plants motile invertebrates
thus worth examining what mechanisms through stress response regulated sessile marine invertebrates general mytilus genus particular strategy dominates gene expression
focus hsp90 family case study stress response sessile animals examine structure function hsp90 upstream region m galloprovincialis
previously two distinct hsp90 genes same genomic organization been isolated m galloprovincialis herein called mghsp90 genes
detailed sequence analysis revealed two genes contain nine exons exhibit great similarities both 5 non-coding coding regions but differ their 3 non-coding regions well three introns due presence repeated sequences
5 non-coding region both genes contains non-translated exon multiple binding sites various transcription factors highly suggestive potential interactions factors hsp90 promoter subtle patterns gene regulation 
comparative analysis hsp90 gene content across all taxa available sequence data clearly shown invertebrate genomes contain relatively small number hsp90 genes compared those vertebrates
thus appears mytilus genome might contain relatively small number tfs and/or hsp90 genes raising question how expression hsp90 other heat shock genes regulated sessile invertebrates
present work perform detailed analysis mghsp90 upstream region terms structure expression reveal presence previously undetected sequence elements unknown function
based tissue-specific expression data also delineate potential associations mghsp90 another 174 genes involved complex pattern expression across tissues
two discoveries discussed within context existing knowledge expected contribute towards deeper understanding heat shock response sessile organisms
