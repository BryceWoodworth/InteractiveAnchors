 introduction 
animals must able rapidly estimate location source unexpected sound example escape predator
challenging task because acoustic signals at two ears vary both source signal acoustic environment information about source location must extracted independently other causes variability
psychophysical studies shown source localization relies variety acoustic cues interaural time level differences spectral cues
at neuronal level spike timing been shown convey information about auditory stimuli particular about source location
although well accepted itds extracted phase-locked responses unknown how information beyond could extracted spike timing neurons
addition potential computational advantages spike timing code task unclear
sound s produced source propagates ears transformed presence head body pinnae possibly other aspects acoustic environment
results two linearly filtered signals f l s f r s at two ears where filtering depends relative position head source
because two signals obtained same source signal binaural stimulus particular structure indicative source location
when signals transformed into spike trains expect structure transformed into synchrony patterns
therefore examined synchrony patterns induced spatialized sounds neuron models consisting spectro-temporal filtering spiking nonlinearity where binaural signals were obtained using variety sound sources filtered through measured human head-related transfer functions
then complemented model postsynaptic neurons responding both sides so synchrony patterns induced binaural structure resulted activation location-specific assemblies neurons
model was able precisely encode source location activation neural assembly way was independent source signal
several influential models addressed mechanisms sound localization at level
considerable progress also been realized understanding physiological mechanisms cue extraction particular neural mechanisms underlying itd sensitivity
studies mostly used simplified binaural stimuli tones noise bursts artificially induced itds
several purely computational models address full problem sound localization virtual acoustic environment realistic sounds although do not suggest how neurons might perform task
here propose binaural neural model performs full localization task more realistic situation based idea synchrony reflects structural properties stimuli setting indicative source location
