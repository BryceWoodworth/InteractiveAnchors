although been demonstrated disruption either pathways profound effect t-cell development do not yet understanding dynamical interactions pathways their joint shaping t cell repertoire
complete digeorge anomaly developmental abnormality results failure thymus develop absence t cells profound immune deficiency
after receiving thymic tissue grafts patients suffering digeorge anomaly develop t cells derived their own precursors but matured donor tissue
followed three digeorge patients after thymus transplantation utilize remarkable opportunity subjects provide elucidate human t-cell developmental regulation
our goal determination respective roles tcr-specific vs tcr-nonspecific regulatory signals growth emerging t-cell populations
during course study measured peripheral blood t-cell concentrations tcr v gene-segment usage cdr3-length spectratypes over two years more each subjects
find through statistical analysis based novel stochastic population-dynamic t-cell model carrying capacity corresponding tcr-specific resources approximately 1000-fold larger than tcr-nonspecific resources implying size peripheral t-cell pool at steady state determined almost entirely tcr-nonspecific mechanisms
nevertheless diversity tcr repertoire depends crucially tcr-specific regulation
estimated strength tcr-specific regulation sufficient ensure rapid establishment tcr repertoire diversity early phase t cell population growth maintain tcr repertoire diversity face substantial clonal expansion-induced perturbation steady state
 introduction 
essential characteristic t lymphocytes their ability population recognize enormous number peptide antigens
capability essential function adaptive immune system attributable diversity t-cell receptors they express
diversity turn comes about through stochastic assembly tcr genomic libraries gene segments tcr alpha beta chains two polypeptides together make up most common form tcr
rearrangement process takes place thymus ultimate source tcr repertoire diversity though many other forces shape raw materials thus provided
other forces concerned study
peripheral t-cell population maintained at constant size spite substantial continual turnover ongoing thymic production clonal expansion response immunological challenges
although detailed understanding t-cell homeostasis not yet complete clear maintenance t cell population size results interplay several mechanisms acting both enhance population growth at low population density limit population growth at high population density
healthy individual absence overt immune activation rate t cell division periphery small regulated through competition resources including growth signals
t cell-deficient host however so-called lymphopenia-induced proliferation rapidly restores system steady-state numbers 
diverse lines investigation imply signals delivered resources provided through both tcr-specific tcr-nonspecific channels essential establishment maintenance size diversity t cell populations
experiments performed thus far been performed non-human animals represent limiting cases one more signals resources entirely eliminated
interested understanding phenomena humans more natural setting regulation via both tcr-specific tcr-non-specific mechanisms intact their interplay jointly determine size t cell population diversity tcr repertoire
our intent paper elucidate mechanisms lead expansion diversification tcr repertoire recovering t-cell-deficient host: our case complete digeorge subject received unrelated unmatched thymus transplant
after transplantation host t-cell precursors migrate bone marrow donor thymus where they develop via thymopoiesis into host t cells then emigrate into peripheral blood
here t cells capacity undergo spontaneous clonal expansion thus leading restoration peripheral t-cell pool
expansion continues until steady state reached
throughout process selective pressure survival emerges among within clones through competition stimulatory signals
steady state t-cell population size arises balance among several phenomena including rapid extensive expansion rare clones through activation-induced peripheral division their subsequent contraction relatively slow turnover diverse pool naive cells through continuous thymic emigration cell death
specific memory t cells arise result clonal expansion appear regulated largely independently naive cells
t cells arising through lymphopenia-induced proliferation acquire markers ordinarily indicate memory phenotype may regulated memory cells though hypothesis not been definitively tested
both size diversity peripheral t cell populations controlled through competition limiting resources
may also controlled directly activities regulatory t cells
been shown example normal t-cell population growth dependent stimulation self-peptide major histocompatibility complex complexes through tcr requiring tcr specific spmhc complex
but t-cell population growth also depends cytokines il7 il15 act independently tcr specificity
furthermore growth survival all cells require adequate space nutrients utilization independent tcr specificity 
our current understanding lymphopenia-induced proliferation due studies mice demonstrating t cells divide rapidly after transfer into t cell-deficient irradiated mice but not after transfer normal mice
moreover overall t cell numbers t cell-deficient animals after transfer clonal expansion similar t cell numbers normal animals suggesting control mechanisms acting total t cell numbers rather than clone-specific manner
importance tcr specific signals been studied at length showing competition within t cell clones important maintaining tcr repertoire diversity
been shown example t-cell-deficient host t cell must interact antigen-presenting cells bearing mhc allele responsible cell's thymic selection order proliferate
t-cell sufficient host tcr-spmhc interaction necessary t cell survival
furthermore naive polyclonal t cells divide when transferred tcr-transgenic hosts do monoclonal t cells transferred tcr-transgenic hosts differing clonotype
t cells do not divide however hosts identical clonotype
mice lacking mhc class ii expression do not repopulate periphery cd4 t cells at all suggesting peripheral mhc class ii expression needed survival cd4 t cells
present context important note mhc class ii matching thymic grafts complete digeorge subjects not necessary development cd4 t cells 
tcr-nonspecific signals include cytokines cytokine interleukin-7 necessary survival nave t cells
lymphopenia-induced proliferation memory cells requires il7 il15
t cells lost ability respond il7 after leaving thymus no longer able proliferate produce cytokines acquire memory cell phenotype
mice il7 signaling been completely abrogated few mature t cells found peripheral blood behave abnormally
experiments il7-receptor formula deficient mice shown reduction t-cell capacity proliferate upon stimulation leading six seven-fold reduction frequency clonogenic t cells compared t cells il7r-sufficient mice well 50 percent reduction average clone size single il7r / t cells compared il7r / t cells
another study mice lacking interleukin 2 receptor formula chain and/or jak family tyrosine kinase had severe combined immune defects lack t lymphocyte maturation function
phenomenon presumably attributable fact formula part receptor il7 il15 ; its loss leads abrogation both cytokine signaling pathways others well
moreover humans absence formula jak-3 family periphery lacks t cells completely 
assess contributions thymic emigration rate steady-state t-cell population size berzins et al engrafted variable numbers thymuses into mice observed size naive t-cell population increased proportion number thymic grafts while size memory population remained unchanged
may importance note thymus grafts themselves produced il7
humans transplantation thymic tissue at varying doses into complete digeorge anomaly subjects showed no significant effect nave cd4 cd8 t cell numbers
