 introduction 
recent studies demonstrated neurons neuronal networks capable functional homeostasis maintaining specific levels neural activity over long time scales
although combination currents within individual neurons same class varies widely output neurons even network whole remains remarkably stable
interestingly some circumstances function maintained despite changes neuronal morphology
computational models been used explore processes underlying neuronal homeostasis demonstrated many combinations conductance parameters across parameter space evoke similar firing patterns
neuronal morphology also seems under homeostatic control: global features including distribution dendritic mass conserved across different classes neurons making unlikely local morphologic features dendritic length numbers branches regulated independently
nonetheless computational models not yet explored how morphology might contribute functional homeostasis
dendritic morphology critical determinant neuronal firing dynamics signal processing
influence morphology neuronal processing further enhanced active ion channels distributed throughout dendrites

begin test hypotheses like introduce novel application mathematical sensitivity analysis quantify effects different classes parameters like active conductances morphology model output
quantification allows us compare effects each parameters models across parameter space produce similar output identifying mechanisms homeostasis
sensitivity analysis been used widely physics chemical engineering biological signaling models understand relationship between model input output but its use within computational neuroscience been limited
traditionally sensitivity analysis performed locally around single optimal model globally reporting general sensitivity throughout parameter space quantify how each parameter contributes model output
large number parameters their nonlinear interactions render techniques insufficient over broad parameter space neuronal compartment models
synthesize approaches explore sensitivity landscapes provide global picture parameter sensitivities while identifying how intrinsic properties individual neurons influence their firing patterns
method adapted easily compare sensitivities parameters any computational model
our method defined three basic steps: parameterizing morphology permit its systematic variation; evaluating sensitivity small perturbations models across parameter space; exploring sensitivity landscapes constructed local sensitivities identify global trends
simplify presentation our method use reduced morphologic model comprising soma cylindrical dendrite
later demonstrate our sensitivity analysis method applied models include more realistic morphologies
our analysis identified principal directions over sensitivity magnitude even sign all parameters varied most
at same time found domains across space different groups parameters even morphologic ones had highest sensitivities
together results reveal mechanisms maintain homeostasis both locally globally across parameter space
show how sensitivities used predict compensatory tradeoffs quantitatively between morphologic conductance parameters maintain target activity levels area ii cells
compensatory mechanisms exist many systems where function conserved despite variability dendritic structure synaptic input membrane excitability may offset some morphologic changes associated aging neurodegenerative disorders
sensitivity landscapes provide new insight into mechanisms functional homeostasis throughout brain facilitate analysis homeostasis any biological system
