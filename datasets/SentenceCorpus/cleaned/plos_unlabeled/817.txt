 introduction 
rna remarkably versatile acting not only messengers transfer genetic information dna protein but also critical structural components catalytic enzymes cell
more intriguingly non-coding rnas been found play important regulatory roles
they mediate gene expression post-transcriptionally two ways: one serve trans-acting antisense rnas micrornas hybridize target mrnas silence their expression ; other form structural cis-elements mrnas riboswitches regulate gene expression mediating transcription termination translation initiation
regulatory roles ncrnas make them promising drug targets efficient tools drug development gene therapy 
past few years many cis-regulatory rna structural motifs been identified prokaryotes
they often located 5 untranslated regions mrnas sense interact cognate factors including proteins rnas small metabolites even temperature changes mediate transcription attenuation translation initiation mrna stability
functions regulatory rnas intrinsically tied their secondary structures mostly recognizable stem-loops pseudoknots
moreover regulatory rnas often conserved during evolution: similar regulatory rna elements shared multiple co-regulated genes same metabolic pathway conserved orthologous genes across closely related species 
experimental screenings cis-regulatory rnas highly labor time consuming
demonstrated previous studies parallel way find good candidates computationally followed targeted experimental validation
because functional regulatory rnas often evolutionarily conserved their secondary structures identify them finding significantly conserved rna secondary structures orthologous genes across closely related species
accomplish need two tools: one accurately predict common rna secondary structures multiple related sequences other distinguish functional rna secondary structures random foldings rna sequences
number algorithms been developed common rna secondary structure prediction rnaalifold dynalign comrna cmfinder foldalign
recently published new algorithm called rna sampler predicting common rna secondary structures structural alignments multiple sequences
both our study independent studies other researchers demonstrated rna sampler provides more accurate structure predictions generates better structural alignments sequences wide range identities than other leading software similar purposes
moreover rna sampler runs fast feasible common rna secondary structure prediction genome scale
studies shown single sequence rna secondary structure alone not sufficient distinguish functional rna random sequence
however availability multiple rna sequences related species comparative genomics approaches provide additional power identify functional rna structures
one strategy design scoring function predicted rna secondary structures examine difference between score distributions real structures randomly permutated structures employed rna identification pipeline based cmfinder comrna
but one limitation approach user needs generate large number random sequence sets each set real sequences doing structure predictions permutated sequence sets usually time consuming
besides difficult find score cutoff make call between functional random rnas
another strategy train classification model based features distinguish common structures known functional rnas those random rnas then apply classification model newly predicted common rna structures determine whether they functional random rnas
rna classification algorithms employing strategy include qrna rnaz dynalign libsvm
qrna classifies pairwise sequence alignment posterior probabilities three probabilistic models rna coding null
rnaz dynalign libsvm both employ support vector machines build classification models
train classification model developer still needs generate large number random sequence sets negative training sets make structure predictions them but once classification model trained user directly utilize model identify functional rnas without need generate perform folding random sequences
type sequences used train classification models essential their classification performance new sequences
qrna dynalign libsvm only use trnas rrnas their training rna structures rnaz trained multiple rna gene/motif families rfam database but only uses sequence sets high identities
avoid overfitting classification model specific classes rnas using training sets cover wide range sequence identities variety rna families more desirable
addition training classification model using more accurately predicted rna common structures alignments advantageous more sensitive classification functional rnas random ones
rnaz uses rnaalifold common rna structure prediction
when using sequence alignments its input rnaalifold performs poorly predicting rna structures sequence sets low identities
structure prediction accuracy rnaalifold may improved using structural alignments but rnaz might need re-trained use structural alignments
paper present new svm based functional rna identifier named rssvm
rssvm applies set features represent common rna secondary structures structural alignments generated rna sampler predicts rna structures more accurately than other approaches
rssvm trained rna sets wide range sequence identities all bacterial rna motif/gene families rfam database
rssvm more sensitive identifying real functional rnas than other leading rna classification programs including rnaz dynalign libsvm qrna at same false positive rate
applied rssvm multiple shewanella genomes identify putative cis-regulatory rna motifs 5 utrs orthologous genes
shewanella oneidensis facultative gram-negative proteobacterium
extraordinary abilities use wide variety metals organic molecules electron acceptors respiration gives great potential applied bioremediation both metal organic pollutants
complete genomic sequences shewanella oneidensis multiple other shewanella species provide good resources discovering cis-regulatory rnas using comparative genomics approaches
combining recent predictions putative dna cis-regulatory motifs s oneidensis will more complete view gene regulation s oneidensis at different regulation levels
