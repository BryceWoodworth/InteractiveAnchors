location sd sequences relative start codons stability hybridization between mrna rrna correlate rate synthesis
thus accurate characterization sd sequences enhances our understanding how organism's transcriptome relates its cellular proteome
implemented individual nearest neighbor hydrogen bond model oligo oligo hybridization created new metric relative spacing identify both location hybridization potential sd sequences simulating binding between mrnas single-stranded 16s rrna 3 tails
18 prokaryote genomes identified 2,420 genes out 58,550 where strongest binding translation initiation region included start codon deviating expected location sd sequence five ten bases upstream
designated rs 1 genes
additional analysis uncovered unusual bias start codon majority rs 1 genes used gug not aug furthermore 624 rs 1 genes whose sd sequence was associated free energy release less than 8.4 kcal/mol 384 were within 12 nucleotides upstream in-frame initiation codons
most likely explanation unexpected location sd sequence 384 genes mis-annotation start codon
way new rs metric provides improved method gene sequence annotation
remaining strong rs 1 genes appear their sd sequences unexpected location includes start codon
thus our rs metric provides new way explore role rrna mrna nucleotide hybridization translation initiation
 introduction 
1974 shine dalgarno sequenced 3 end escherichia coli's 16s ribosomal rna observed part sequence 5 accucc 3 was complementary motif 5 ggaggu 3 located 5 initiation codons several messenger rnas
they combined observation previously published experimental evidence suggested complementarity between 3 tail 16s rrna region 5 start codon mrna was sufficient create stable double-stranded structure could position ribosome correctly mrna during translation initiation
motif mrnas 5 ggaggu 3 variations also complementary parts 3 16s rrna tail since been referred shine dalgarno sequence
shine dalgarno's theory was bolstered steitz jakes 1975 eventually experimentally verified 1987 hui de boer jacob et al 
since shine dalgarno's publication two different approaches been used identify position sd sequences prokaryotes: sequence similarity free energy calculations
methods based sequence similarity include searching upstream start codons sub-strings sd sequences at least three nucleotides long
identification errors arise approach several reasons
threshold similarity does not exist clearly delineate actual sd sequences spurious sites significant but low degree similarity sd sequence
lack certainty led number observations gene sequences appear partition themselves into two categories: those obvious sd sequences those without
inability sequence techniques pinpoint exact location sd sequence poses problem because its location believed affect translation initiation 
second approach using free energy calculations based thermodynamic considerations proposed mechanism 30s binding mrna overcomes limitations sequence analysis
watson crick hybridization occurs between 3 terminal single-stranded nucleotides 16s rrna sd sequence mrna significant effect translation
formation hydrogen bonds between aligned complementary nucleotides basis watson crick hybridization results more stable double-stranded structure lower free energy than participating single-stranded sequences
one long-standing implementation model mfold quantifies degree hybridization stability rna secondary structure calculating change energy
method estimating free energy been adapted identify sd sequences repeatedly calculating g values progressive alignments rrna tail mrna region upstream start codon
all studies observed trough negative g upstream start codon whose location largely coincident sd consensus sequence
second approach both identify sd sequence pinpoint its exact location having minimal g value
however exact location sd sequence dependent nucleotide indexing scheme algorithm i.e nucleotide designated 0 position
normalize indexing further extend free energy analysis through start codon into coding region genes created new metric relative spacing
metric localizes binding across entire translation initiation region relative rrna tail enabling us characterize binding involves start codon well sequences downstream
rs also independent length rrna tail property allows comparison binding locations between species
examining sequences downstream start codons could explore mrnas lack any upstream region leaderless mrnas
lack any 5 untranslated leader mrnas prompted searches other sequence motifs could interact 16s rrna
one downstream box hypothesis been disproved
thus there continued search explanation highly conserved sequences 3 initiation codon been observed many leaderless mrnas 
study use rs metric identify positions minimal g troughs genes 18 species prokaryotes test its usefulness means improve existing annotation tools i.e identifying sd sequences
observe 2,420 genes where strongest binding entire tir takes place one nucleotide downstream start codon at rs 1
624 genes unusually strong binding
then determine if 624 genes were mis-annotated conclude 384
