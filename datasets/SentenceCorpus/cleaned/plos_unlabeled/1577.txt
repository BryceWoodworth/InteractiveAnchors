 
accurate modelling biological systems requires deeper more complete knowledge about molecular components their functional associations than currently
traditionally new knowledge protein associations generated experiments played central role systems modelling contrast generally less trusted bio-computational predictions
however will not achieve realistic modelling complex molecular systems if current experimental designs lead biased screenings real protein networks leave large functionally important areas poorly characterised
assess likelihood built comprehensive network models yeast human proteomes using meta-statistical integration diverse computationally predicted protein association datasets
compared predicted networks against combined experimental datasets seven biological resources at different level statistical significance
eukaryotic predicted networks resemble all topological noise features experimentally inferred networks both species also show observation not due random behaviour
addition topology predicted networks contains information true protein associations beyond constitutive first order binary predictions
also observe most reliable predicted protein associations experimentally uncharacterised our models constituting hidden dark matter networks analogy astronomical systems
some dark matter shows enrichment particular functions contains key functional elements protein networks hubs associated important functional areas like regulation ras protein signal transduction human cells
thus characterising large functionally important dark matter elusive established experimental designs may crucial modelling biological systems
any case predictions provide valuable guide experimentally elusive regions
 introduction 
many features biological systems cannot inferred simple sum their components but rather emerge network properties
organisms comprise systems highly integrated networks accelerating networks all components integrated coordinated time space
given complexity gaps our current knowledge prevent us modelling complete living organisms
therefore development bio-computational approaches identifying new protein functions protein-protein functional associations play important role systems biology 
scarce knowledge biological systems further compounded experimental error
common different high-throughput experimental approaches applied same biological system yield different outcomes resulting protein networks different topological biological properties
however errors not restricted high-throughput analysis
example been demonstrated high-throughput yeast two-hybrid interactions human proteins more precise than literature-curated interactions supported single publication 
there been great deal work analysing biological networks across different species giving insights into how networks evolve
however many publications yielded disparate sometimes contradictory conclusions
observation poor overlap protein networks across species divergence amongst organisms suggest fast evolution
significant variation subunit compositions functional modules also been observed protein networks across species
however contrast observations recent work using combined protein-protein interaction data suggests high conservation protein networks between yeast human
approach based data combination stresses importance integrating different data sources reduce bias associated errors functional prediction increase coverage network modelling been demonstrated numerous studies 
increasing accuracy networks integrating different protein interaction data relies intuitive principle combining multiple independent sources evidence gives greater confidence than single source
any genome wide computational analyses expect prediction errors randomly distributed amongst large sample true negative interactions
hence unlikely two independent prediction methods will both identify same false positive data large interactomes like yeast human
general expect precision increase proportionally number independent approaches supporting same evidence
available list well-known integration methods specifically designed integrate diverse protein-protein interaction ppi datasets chose fisher method order predictor independent experimental data used validate
fisher integration method not trained supervised method example naive bayes svm methods
fisher method presumes gaussian random distribution prediction datasets' scores null hypothesis fisher integrated score calculation based information theory statistics
therefore fisher integration score completely independent experimental datasets used study validate compare predictions
work significantly increase prediction power binary protein functional associations yeast human proteomes integrating different individual prediction methods using fisher integration method
three different untrained methods implemented: geco ; hippi ; coda run two protein domain classifications cath pfam
four different prediction datasets obtained methods were integrated using simple integration fisher's method examples untrained methods
similarly ab-initio prediction datasets string were also integrated using fisher integration compared against integrated prediction datasets our methods
results fisher integration our prediction datasets were benchmarked compared against individual prediction methods results integrated string methods
all cases demonstrate increased performance integrated approach fisher integration geco hippi codacath codapfam datasets yielding best results
protein pairs identified significant fisher integration p-values were used build protein network model yeast human proteomes referred predictogram
additionally all protein-protein associations several major biological databases including reactome kegg go funcat intact mint hrpd were retrieved combined into network referred knowledgegram
implemented other pioneering studies built predicted experimental models further comparison
different network topology parameters were calculated compared between kg pg models two test species homo sapiens sacharomyces cerevisae
observe how networks change cut-off confidence score predictions varied
results pg kg network comparison demonstrate pg networks resemble kg networks many major topological features model substantial fraction real protein network associations previously observed some bacterial predicted networks 
there been frequent observations low overlaps between different experimental high-throughput approaches
our comparison pg kg models also show intersection between two models small majority predictions pg novel predictions
however overlap between pg kg significantly higher than expected random both species supporting correspondence between pg kg screenings ppi space
pg kg data overlap significantly larger yeast than human pointing better functional characterization yeast ppi network presence larger dark areas human ppi network still hidden current experimental knowledge
suggest novel prediction set may valuable estimation relative differences dark matter uncharacterised protein-protein associations between both specie show dark matter contains key elements hubs important functional roles cell
analogy dark matter protein network models refers predicted protein-protein associations whose existence not yet been experimentally verified
study suggest dark matter involves functional associations difficult characterise current experimental assays making any network modelling organisms highly incomplete therefore inaccurate
results divided into four main sections predicted experimental ppi models human yeast compared
first section analyses performance single integrated methods predicting protein associations determines correlation between prediction scores degree accuracy noise predictions
second chapter compares topological network features predicted experimental ppi models at equivalent levels accuracy noise
third section searches functional differences between predicted experimental models looking specific functional areas appear illuminated prediction methods but elusive experimental approaches
whilst final fourth section explores whether predicted ppi network graphs contain additional context-based information protein associations beyond sets predicted protein pairs used build networks
