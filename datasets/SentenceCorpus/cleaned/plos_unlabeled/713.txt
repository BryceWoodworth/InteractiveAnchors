 introduction 
pyrosequencing novel experimental technique determining sequence dna bases genome
method faster less laborious cheaper than existing technologies but pyrosequencing reads also significantly shorter more error-prone than those obtained sanger sequencing 
paper address computational issues arise applying technology sequencing rna virus sample
within-host rna virus populations consist different haplotypes evolutionarily related
population exhibit high degree genetic diversity often referred quasispecies concept originally described mutation-selection balance
viral genetic diversity key factor disease progression vaccine design antiretroviral drug therapy
ultra-deep sequencing mixed virus samples promising approach quantifying diversity resolving viral population structure 
pyrosequencing virus population produces many reads each originates exactly one but unknown haplotype population
thus central problem reconstruct read data set possible haplotypes consistent observed reads infer structure population i.e relative frequency each haplotype
here present computational four-step procedure making inference about virus population based set pyrosequencing reads
first reads aligned reference genome
second sequencing errors corrected locally windows along multiple alignment using clustering techniques
next assemble haplotypes consistent observed reads
formulate problem search set covering paths directed acyclic graph show how search problem solved very efficiently
finally introduce statistical model mimics sequencing process employ maximum likelihood principle estimating frequency each haplotype population
alignment step proposed procedure straightforward data analyzed here been discussed elsewhere
due presence reference genome only pair-wise alignment necessary between each read reference genome
will therefore focus core methods error correction haplotype reconstruction haplotype frequency estimation
two independent approaches pursued validating proposed method
first present extensive simulation results all steps method
second validate procedure reconstructing four independent hiv populations pyrosequencing reads comparing populations results clonal sanger sequencing same samples
datasets consist approximately 5000 8000 reads average length 105 bp sequenced 1 kb region pol gene clinical samples hiv-1 populations
pyrosequencing produce up 200,000 usable reads single run
part our contribution analysis interaction between number reads sequencing error rate theoretical resolution haplotype reconstruction
methods developed paper scale huge datasets under reasonable assumptions
however concentrate mainly sample size produces finer resolution than what typically obtained using limiting dilution clonal sequencing
since many samples run simultaneously independently raises possibility obtaining data about 20 populations one pyrosequencing run
estimating viral population structure set reads general extremely hard computational problem because huge number possible haplotypes
decoupling error correction haplotype reconstruction haplotype frequency estimation breaks problem into three smaller more manageable tasks each also interest its own right
presented methods not restricted rna virus populations but apply whenever reference genome available aligning reads read coverage sufficient genetic distance between haplotypes large enough
clonal data indicates typical variation hiv pol gene about 3 5 percent single patient
find populations grow more diverse they become easier reconstruct
even at 3 percent diversity find much population reconstructed using our methods
pol gene been sequenced extensively only one specific insertion seems occur namely 69 insertion complex occurs under nrti pressure
none our samples were treated nrtis sanger clones did not display indel
therefore assume throughout there no true indels population
however algorithms developed paper generalize straightforward manner case true indels
problem estimating population structure sequence reads similar assembly highly repetitive genome
however rather than reconstructing one genome seek reconstruct population very similar genomes
problem also related environmental sequencing projects try assess genomes all species community
while associated computational biology problems related those appear other metagenomics projects novel approaches required deal short error-prone pyrosequencing reads complex structure viral populations
problem also similar haplotype reconstruction problem main difference being number haplotypes unknown advance estimating diversity alternative splicing 
more generally problem estimating diversity population genome sequence samples been studied extensively microbial populations
example spectrum contig lengths been used estimate diversity shotgun sequencing data
using pyrosequencing reads microbial diversity been assessed counting blast hits sequence databases
our methods differ previous work show how analyze highly directed ultra-deep sequencing data using rigorous mathematical statistical framework
