 introduction 
amyloid fibril formation associated increase structure content leads fibrillar aggregation
however should noted increased level beta structure characteristic property several different types protein aggregates
addition proteins observed amyloid diseases recent studies shown diverse proteins not related any amyloid disease aggregate into fibrils under destabilizing conditions
normal proteins become toxic when they undergo fibrillation
there no consensus about toxicity different states: small oligomers large oligomers protofilaments protofibrils filaments mature fibrils amorphous aggregates
significant advancements recent research led discovery toxic species amyloid diseases may not fibrils themselves but rather pre-fibrillar aggregates
possible mechanism toxicity synuclein protofibrils been demonstrated
been shown protofibrils form elliptical pores like bacterial toxins puncture cell membranes resulting cell death
therefore mechanism amyloid formation under intensive investigation
recognition factors influence protein conformational changes misfolding one general fundamental problems solution will help us find effective treatments amyloid illnesses
experimental observation not all proteins amyloidogenic specific continuous regions amyloid-forming proteins more amyloidogenic than others suggests there sequence propensity amyloid formation
moreover observation some short peptides also form amyloids implies segments usually exposed environment nucleate transition native proteins into amyloid state suggests fibril formation sequence-specific
mechanism amyloidogenesis natively folded proteins 2-microglobulin transthyretin partial unfolding observed believed prerequisite proteins' assembly into amyloid fibrils both vitro vivo
been suggested residues enhanced flexibility solvent accessibility important initiation fibrillation
means partial unfolding rigid native structure provide specific interface beginning fibrillation
thus understand molecular mechanism amyloidosis necessary find factors induce partial unfolding proteins subsequent amyloid fibril formation at near physiological conditions
some intrinsically disordered proteins involved amyloid diseases
fact may indicate disorder necessary condition aggregation
been shown very small change environment proteins often might cause their partial folding aggregation
knowledge characteristics control process amyloid fibril formation important finding effective drugs treatment amyloid diseases
uversky fink their review illustrate protein fibrillogenesis requires partially folded conformation 
first high-resolution crystal amyloid fiber formed sequence-designed polypeptide been obtained
recently atomic structure cross spine seven-residue peptide segment sup35 was determined
double sheet each sheet formed parallel segments stacked register
side chains protruding two sheets form dry tightly self-complementing steric zipper bonds sheets
within each sheet every segment bound two neighboring segments through stacks both backbone side-chain hydrogen bonds
there several computational methods predicting protein's propensity amyloid fibril formation
work fernandez et al was shown concentration defects insufficient shielding hydrogen bonds water attack might yield aggregation-induced nucleus
but analysis defects revealed extensive exposure hydrogen bonds water attack might necessary but not sufficient condition imply propensity organized aggregation 
computational algorithm been suggested detects nonnative strand propensity sequences consideration relationships between protein local sequence secondary structure terms tertiary contacts
algorithm detects sequences within protein favorable triggering amyloid fibril formation
worthwhile emphasize here both algorithms prediction amyloidogenic properties polypeptide chains considered above applied only those proteins three-dimensional structure known
based physico chemical properties aggregation sequences computational algorithm model was developed predicting aggregation rate broad range polypeptide chains
model identifies aggregation sites within protein predicts parallel antiparallel organization sheets fibril
should noted however overpredictions aggregation sites were not analyzed statistically
other hand there method prediction amyloidogenic regions amino acid sequence alone
after experimental investigation amyloidogenic properties model six-residue peptide its mutants authors obtained six-residue amyloidogenic pattern used pattern identification amyloidogenic fragments proteins
amyloidogenic pattern been used validate premise amyloidogenicity protein indeed localized short protein stretches
been demonstrated conversion soluble non-amyloidogenic protein into amyloidogenic-prone molecule triggered non-destabilizing six-residue amyloidogenic insertion particular structural environment
recently new method identifying fibril-forming segments proteins been suggested
method based threading six-residue peptides through known crystal structure amyloid fiber formed peptide sup35
putative prediction accepted prediction if its energy evaluated rosettadesign lower than threshold energy
should added molecular dynamics yield valuable information about structural changes arise at atomic level upon formation amyloid fibrils while information difficult obtain experimentally
another interesting new method based sequence-specific interaction energies between pairs protein fragments calculated statistical analysis native folds globular proteins
algorithm correctly predicts positions most aggregation-prone portions some polypeptide chains
formation sufficient number interactions necessary compensate loss conformational entropy during protein folding process
therefore structural uniqueness native proteins result balance between conformational entropy energy residue interactions
seems disordered regions protein chain do not sufficient number interactions compensate loss conformational entropy results formation globular state
other hand large increase energy interactions will lead loss unique structure because strengthening contact energy will speed up folding but also likely lead erroneous folds 
been suggested lack rigid globular structure under physiological conditions might represent considerable functional advantage intrinsically disordered proteins their large plasticity allows them interact efficiently several different targets compared folded protein limited conformational flexibility
been shown disordered regions involved dna binding other types molecular recognition
large portion sequences intrinsically disordered proteins contain segments low complexity high predicted flexibility
also been indicated combination low overall hydrophobicity large net charge represent structural feature intrinsically disordered proteins comparison small globular proteins
there currently several widely used methods prediction disordered regions: globplot simple propensity-based approach evaluating tendency residues regular secondary structure; pondr vl3h able distinguish experimentally verified disordered proteins globular proteins various machine learning approaches; disopred definition disorder restrained regions missing x-ray structures but specifically recognized support vector machine disopred model; iupred assigns order/disorder status residues basis their ability form favorable pairwise contacts
were first our knowledge who used number contacts per residue parameter distinguish folded intrinsically disordered proteins
extended our method predict disordered regions made comparisons above-mentioned methods
been demonstrated our method best among widely used methods sets proteins considered here
despite considerable efforts understand mechanism still unclear what responsible amyloidogenic disordered regions
goal work test our hypothesis about whether protein regions possess expected strong packing density responsible amyloidogenic properties proteins while regions weak packing density simultaneously responsible appearance disordered regions
introduce new parameter namely mean packing density enables prediction both amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered regions protein sequence
findings support concept occurrence amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered regions similar basis different peptides proteins
