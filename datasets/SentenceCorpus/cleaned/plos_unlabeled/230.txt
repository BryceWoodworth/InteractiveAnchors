 introduction 
vascular endothelial growth factor key promoter angiogenesis vivo increases proliferation migration endothelial cells cultured vitro
rats there five main splice variants vegf denoted 120 144 164 188 205 120 164 isoforms most prevalent
vegf expressed at different levels variety cells throughout body including skeletal muscle
vegf 164 secreted 45-kda homodimeric glycoprotein containing exon-7 encoded domain allows binding heparin neuropilin-1
vegf 120 also homodimeric glycoprotein but missing exon-7 encoded domain
because domain only vegf 164 bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans present high concentrations extracellular matrix basement membrane spaces two splice variants responsible different signaling both physiological cancer angiogenesis
furthermore due presence high concentrations hspg bm surrounds vegf-secreting cells large amount vegf 164 becomes bound sequestered near sources vegf secretion creating steep vegf gradient
cellular response vegf occurs when signaling initiated binding vegf its cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases vegfr1 vegfr2
vegf degraded after internalized two vegf receptors
receptors their interactions vegf each other discussed depth 
vegf involved both physiological pathological angiogenesis
vegf upregulation necessary physiological angiogenesis under conditions hypoxia via oxygen-sensing mechanisms hif-1 pathway increased shear stress blood vessels
rat extensor digitorum longus muscle during exercise both hypoxia increased shear stress induce angiogenesis through overexpression vegf myocytes
because importance vegf many clinical trials under way both pro anti-angiogenic therapies
fda approved anti-vegf treatments including avastin antibody vegf macugen rna aptamer binds sequesters human vegf 165
use vegf pro-angiogenic treatment cardiac limb ischemia generated intense interest but direct administration vegf not yet produced effective results humans initial trials transplantation angiogenic cells proven effective but require further work 
create effective vegf-driven pro-angiogenic therapy better understanding needed both physiological pathological vegf-induced angiogenesis
increasing vegf concentration leads angiogenesis but concentrations vegf beyond critical levels may result formation abnormal vessels hemangiomas
thus normal blood vessels only formed if microenvironmental amounts vegf carefully maintained above threshold levels therapeutic angiogenesis but below threshold levels abnormal angiogenesis over prolonged period time
furthermore responses vegf depend not only vegf concentration but also vegf gradients enhance vegf-induced angiogenesis direct capillary growth
therefore not sufficient measure bulk quantities vegf large samples tissue order predict angiogenic behavior
present study constructed computational model study extracellular diffusion vegf vivo effects vegf upregulation gradients receptor binding using well-characterized rat edl tissue sample environment
previously constructed models studying kinetics vegf binding receptors cells vitro effect presence nrp-1 placental growth factor
also shown using monte carlo methods despite very small concentrations free vegf continuum description terms vegf concentrations justified
diffusion vegf vitro also been studied using computational model
however our knowledge first model vegf diffusion geometrically complex vivo environment includes: transport two most abundant vegf isoforms through ecm bm hspg binding kinetics vegf secretion vegf receptor binding internalization kinetics
nrp-1 was not included model because there currently no available measurements amount nrp-1 skeletal muscle
using model predict vegf distribution analyze vegf gradients at resolution currently impossible measure experimentally
use model will aid understanding mechanisms physiological therapeutic vegf overexpression
model general may built upon future include additional molecular species new experimental data emerging e.g neuropilin expression level skeletal muscle; also applied specific drug interactions other tissue types
