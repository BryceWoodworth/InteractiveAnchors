 introduction 
non-coding rna crucial importance functioning living cell where plays key catalytic regulatory structural roles
understanding exact mechanisms behind functions therefore great importance both biology medicine
many cases understanding requires knowledge rna structure atomic detail
however determining structure rna molecule experimentally typically time consuming expensive difficult task
therefore algorithms rna structure prediction attracted much interest initially main focus predicting secondary structure
many noticeable advances been made area secondary structure prediction; most recently introduction statistical sampling had important impact 
past years increasing number relevant structures become available much progress been made understanding three dimensional structure rna
conformational space rna been analyzed using methods inspired ramachandran plot proteins rna base pair interactions been accurately classified conformational space rna backbone been clustered into discrete recurring conformations
new insights led several useful tools modeling rna 3-d structure significant advances atomic resolution prediction recently been reported 
however routine prediction rna 3-d structure still remains important open problem growing gap between number known sequences determined structures problem becoming more more pronounced
two key ingredients algorithms rna 3-d structure prediction namely accurate energy function conformational sampling procedure both only partly solved problems
here focus latter problem
current state art rna conformational sampling based fragment assembly methods construct plausible conformations stringing together short fragments obtained experimental structures
methods led numerous important breakthroughs related fields protein rna 3-d structure prediction last ten years
nonetheless fragment assembly methods not panacea
one problems associated methods they inherently discretize continuous conformational space hence do not cover all relevant conformations
problematic since resolution conformational search procedure imposes limits energy function; use fine-grained energy terms requires continuous adjustments rna's dihedral degrees freedom fragment assembly methods cannot provide
other words shortcomings conformational sampling method need counteracted tweaking energy function
furthermore full conformational detail great importance complete understanding rna catalysis binding dynamics 
another fundamental problem fragment assembly methods their non-probabilistic nature makes their rigorous use framework statistical physics problematic
particularly currently impossible ensure unbiased sampling markov chain monte carlo framework using fragment assembly proposal function
other words using fragment library implies adding inherently unknown additional term energy function
means unbiased simulation dynamics rna molecule under control all-atom empirical forcefield using fragment assembly methods currently impossible
reasons developed new solution conformational sampling problem: probabilistic model called barnacle describes rna structure natural continuous space
barnacle makes possible efficiently sample 3-d conformations rna-like short length scale
model used purely proposal distribution but also energy term enforcing realistic local conformations
imposing favorable long range interactions hydrogen bonding between bases lies outside scope local model task global energy function
barnacle combines dynamic bayesian network suits sequential nature rna molecule directional statistics branch statistics concerned representation angular data
model not only computationally attractive but also rigorously interpreted language statistical physics making attractive theoretical viewpoint well
approach conceptually related probabilistic models protein structure recently proposed our group
however model presented here clearly far trivial extension rna molecule many more degrees freedom than protein; rna backbone alone there 11 angles per residue opposed two proteins
many degrees freedom combined limited number experimentally determined rna structures make particularly challenging statistical task very different strategy was required
particular approach used proteins would case rna require use probability density function 7-dimensional hypertorus poses serious statistical computational obstacle
below describe probabilistic model detail show captures crucial aspects local rna structure
also demonstrate its usefulness context rna 3-d prediction end outlook possible applications
