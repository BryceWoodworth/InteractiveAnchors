 
genome wide association studies test association between common genetic markers disease phenotype shown varying degrees success
while many factors could potentially confound gwa studies focus possibility multiple rare variants may act concert influence disease etiology
here describe algorithm rv analysis rarecover
algorithm combines disparate collection rvs low effect modest penetrance
further does not require rare variants adjacent location
extensive simulations over range assumed penetrance population attributable risk values illustrate power our approach over other published methods including collapsing weighted-collapsing strategies
showcase method apply rarecover re-sequencing data cohort 289 individuals at extremes body mass index distribution
individual samples were re-sequenced at two genes faah mgll known involved endocannabinoid metabolism
rarecover analysis identifies exactly one significantly associated region each gene each about 5 kbp upstream regulatory regions
data suggests rvs help disrupt expression two genes leading lowered metabolism corresponding cannabinoids
overall our results point power including rvs measuring genetic associations
 introduction 
common disease common variant hypothesis postulates etiology common diseases mediated commonly occurring genomic variants population
served basis genome wide association studies test association between individual genomic markers disease phenotype
using genome-wide panels common snps gwa studies been successful identifying hundreds statistically significant associations many common diseases well several quantitative traits
nevertheless success gwa studies been mixed
significant genetic loci not been detected several common diseases known strong genetic component
additionally many common diseases associations discovered gwa studies account only small fraction heritability disease
while many factors could potentially confound gwa studies focus possibility multiple rare variants may act concert influence disease etiology
alternative cdcv hypothesis common disease rare variant hypothesis been topic much recent debate shown promise explaining disease etiology multiple studies
example rare variants been implicated reduced sterol absorption consequently lower plasma levels ldl colorectal cancer
while some studies shown rvs increase risk recent study indicates rvs also act protectively multiple rvs renal salt handling genes showing association reduced renal salt resorption reduced risk hypertension
additionally rare mutations ifih1 been shown act protectively against type 1 diabetes 
aforementioned studies others focused re-sequencing coding regions candidate genes using sanger sequencing
recent technological advances dna sequencing made possible re-sequence large stretches genome cost-effective manner
enabling large-scale studies impact rvs complex diseases
however several properties rare variants make their genetic effects difficult detect current approaches
bodmer bonilla provide excellent review properties rvs differences between rare common variant analysis
example if causal variant rare disease common then allele's population-attributable-risk consequently odds-ratio will low
additionally even highly penetrant rvs unlikely linkage disequilibrium more common genetic variations might genotyped association study common disease
therefore single-marker tests association exploit ld-based associations likely low power
if cdrv hypothesis holds combination multiple rvs must contribute population risk
case there challenge detecting multi-allelic association between locus disease
methods detect associations only just being developed
natural approach collapsing strategy where multiple rvs at locus collapsed into single variant
strategies low power when causal neutral rvs combined
madsen browning recently proposed weighted-sum statistic detect loci disease individuals enriched rare variants
their approach variants weighted according their frequency unaffected sample low frequency variants being weighted more heavily
each individual scored sum weights mutations carried
test then determines if diseased individuals weighted more heavily than expected null-model
madsen browning show formula variants group being causal combined odds ratio formula weighted-sum statistic detects associations high power
while effective approach depends upon inclusion high proportion causal rare variants formation test statistics strong penetrance detect significant association
their simulations par locus partitioned equally among all variants assumption may not always hold
combined multivariate collapsing method proposed li leal combines variants into groups based upon predefined criteria
individual 1 group if any variant group carried 0 otherwise
cmc approach then considers each groups multivariate analysis explain disease risk
combination collapsing approach multivariate analysis results increase power over single-marker multiple marker approaches
however li leal point out method relies correct grouping variants
power reduced functional variants excluded non-functional variants included group
assignment snps incorrect groups may fact decrease power below attainable through single marker analysis
indeed recent analysis manolio colleagues suggests new methods might needed when causal variants both low par low penetrance values 
here focus model-free method rarecover collapses only subset variants at locus
informally consider locus formula encoding set formula rare variants
rarecover associates formula phenotype measuring strongest possible association formed collapsing any subset formula variants at formula
at first glance approach many problems
first selecting optimal subset snps computationally intensive scaling formula
show greedy approach selecting optimal subset scales linearly making feasible conduct associations large set candidate loci
second confounding factor large number different tests at locus increase likelihood false association
adjustment required control type i error could decrease power method
however extensive simulations show otherwise
our results suggest moderately penetrant alleles formula small par formula moderately sized cohorts sufficient rarecover detect significant association
compares well current power single-marker gwa studies common variants outperforms other methods rv detection

while evidence points genetic association loci obesity multiple recent studies using common snps faah region failed confirm association
pro129thr polymorphism was tentatively associated obesity cohort europe asian ancestry but not been replicated other data 
tested hypothesis multiple rare alleles at loci associated obesity
used unpublished data frazer colleagues where faah mgll regions were re-sequenced using next generation technologies 148 obese 150 non-obese individuals taken extremes body mass index distribution subjects large clinical trial
resequencing identified number common rare variants region
applied rarecover determine if multiple rvs i.e allelic heterogeneity mediated genetic effects faah mgll obesity
rarecover identified single region at each locus permutation adjusted p-values formula formula
each case significant locus was immediately upstream gene consistent regulatory function rare variants
