 introduction 
g protein coupled receptors integral membrane proteins embedded cell surface transmit signals cells response stimuli light ca 2 odorants amino acids nucleotides peptides proteins mediate many physiological functions through their interaction heterotrimeric g proteins
many diseases involve malfunction receptors making them important drug targets
human estimated number gpcrs approximately 948 corresponding about 5 percent total number human genes
however more than 45 percent all modern drugs target gpcrs; represent around 25 percent 100 top-selling drugs worldwide 
while knowledge protein's structure furnishes important information understanding its function drug design progress solving gpcr structures been slow
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy x-ray crystallography two major techniques used determine protein structures
nmr spectroscopy advantages protein does not need crystallized dynamical information extracted
however high concentrations dissolved proteins needed; yet no complete gpcr structure been solved method
x-ray crystallography provide very precise atomic information globular proteins but gpcrs extremely difficult crystallize
fact only single gpcr bovine rhodopsin rod outer segment membrane been solved
unlikely significant number high-resolution gpcr structures will experimentally solved very near future
situation limits use structure-based approaches drug design restricts research into mechanisms control ligand binding gpcrs activation regulation gpcrs signal transduction mediated gpcrs 
fortunately demonstrated recent casp experiments computer-based methods deducing three-dimensional structure protein its amino acid sequence been increasingly successful
among three types structure prediction algorithms homology modeling threading ab initio folding cm builds models aligning target sequence evolutionarily related template structure provides most accurate models
however its success largely dictated evolutionary relationship between target template proteins
example proteins greater than 50 percent sequence identity their templates cm models tend quite close native structure 1 root-mean-squared-deviation native their backbone atoms comparable low-resolution x-ray nmr experiments
when sequence identity drops below 30 percent termed twilight zone cm model accuracy sharply decreases because lack significant structure match substantial alignment errors
here models provided cm often closer template model based rather than native structure sequence interest
been significant unsolved problem
among all registered human gpcrs there only four sequences sequence identity bovine rh greater than 30 percent
ninety-nine percent human gpcrs average sequence identity bovine rh 19.5 percent lie outside traditional comparative modeling regimen 
recently developed threading assembly refinement methodology combines threading ab initio algorithms span homologous nonhomologous regimens
large-scale comprehensive benchmark test 2,234 representative proteins protein data bank after excluding templates having greater than 30 percent sequence identity target two thirds single domain proteins folded models c rmsd native less than 6.5
significant advance over traditional homology modeling many models improved respect their threading templates 
absence additional gpcr crystal structures computer-based modeling may provide best alternative obtaining structural information
work exploit tasser predict tertiary structures all 907 gpcr sequences human genome less than 500 amino acids length
only sequence given gpcr passed tasser no other extrinsic knowledge incorporated into our structure prediction approach
because rearrangements tm helices rh may occur nonhomologous gpcrs ability refine templates most important advantage using tasser comprehensive gpcr modeling
also distinct many other gpcr modeling methods only attempt model tm helical regions tasser generates reasonable predictions loop regions
benchmark tests 39 percent loops four more residues tasser models global rmsd less than 3 native
contrast using widely used homology modeling tool modeller percentage loops accuracy 12 percent
if one considers only accuracy loop conformation itself then 89 percent tasser-generated loops local rmsd less than 3 average rmsd loops up 50 residues below 4
especially important gpcr modeling extracellular loops often critical determining ligand specificity
therefore full-length tasser models offer substantial advantages over traditional comparative modeling methods likely greater aid understanding ligand signaling interactions gpcrs
