 introduction 
knowledge impact individual amino acid mutations protein's stability valuable both understanding protein's natural evolution altering its properties engineering purposes
experimentally measuring effects mutations protein stability laborious process so variety methods been devised predict effects computationally
most existing methods rely some type physicochemical modeling mutation context protein's three-dimensional structure often augmented information gleaned statistical analyses protein sequences structures
types methods moderately accurate at predicting effects mutations stabilities small soluble proteins
there little no published data evaluating their performance larger more complex proteins frequently greatest biological interest although might expected worse given greater difficulty modeling larger structures
alternative approach predicting effects mutations protein stability utilizes information contained alignments evolutionarily related sequences
approach was originally introduced steipe coworkers envisions alignment related sequences representing random sample all possible sequences fold into given protein structure
based loose analogy statistical physics frequency given residue sequence alignment assumed exponential function its contribution protein's stability
often called consensus approach since always predicts most stabilizing mutation will most commonly occurring residue
consensus approach proven surprisingly successful wide range studies supporting basic notion stabilizing residues tend appear more frequently sequence alignments homologous proteins 
but although often effective consensus approach suffers obvious conceptual flaw: alignments natural proteins do not represent random samples all possible sequences encoding given structure but instead highly biased evolutionary relationships
particular residue might occur frequently because arisen repeatedly through independent amino acid substitutions might occur frequently simply because occurred common ancestor many related sequences alignment
sequence evolution even distantly related protein homologs non-ergodic so problem will plague all natural sequence alignments
therefore would clearly desirable extract information about protein stability sequence alignments using method accounts evolutionary relationships
fact there already highly developed mathematical descriptions divergence evolving protein sequences
widely used likelihood-based methods inferring protein phylogenies employ explicit models amino acid substitution assess likelihood phylogenetic trees
however methods make no effort determine how selection protein stability might manifest itself ultimate frequencies amino acids alignment evolved sequences
instead their simplest form phylogenetic methods simply assume there universal average tendency one particular amino acid substituted another
more advanced phylogenetic methods sometimes allow different average substitution tendencies different classes protein residues
still other methods use simulations other structure-based methods derive site-specific substitution matrices different positions protein
however none methods relate substitution probabilities effects mutations experimentally measurable properties protein stability nor do they provide method predicting effects mutations protein phylogenies
here present approach using protein phylogenies infer effects amino acid mutations protein stability
begin describing conceptual framework quantitatively links mutation's effect protein stability probability will fixed evolution
then show how framework used calculate likelihood specific phylogenetic relationships given stability effects all possible amino acid mutations protein
our actual goal do reverse infer stability effects given known protein phylogeny
robustly accomplish use bayesian inference informative priors derived established physicochemical modeling program
compare inferred stability effects published experimental values several proteins show our method outperforms both physicochemical modeling program consensus approach
finally use our method predict mutations increase temperature-stability influenza hemagglutinin complex multimeric membrane-bound glycoprotein stabilizing mutations never previously been successfully predicted any approach
introduce predicted stabilizing mutations into hemagglutinin experimentally demonstrate several them increase temperature-stability protein context live influenza virus
overall our work presents unified framework incorporating protein stability into phylogenetic analyses well demonstrating powerful new approach predicting stabilizing mutations
