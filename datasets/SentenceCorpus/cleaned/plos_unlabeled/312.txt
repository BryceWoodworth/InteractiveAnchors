reason many biochemical parameters driving circuit behavior vary extensively thus not fine-tuned
existing work area asks what extent function any one given circuit robust
but high robustness truly remarkable would expected many circuits similar topology
how high robustness come about through gradual darwinian evolution changes circuit topology gradually one interaction at time
here ask questions model transcriptional regulation networks explore millions different network topologies
robustness mutations noise correlated networks
they show skewed distribution very small number networks being vastly more robust than rest
all networks attain given gene expression state organized into graph whose nodes networks differ their topology
remarkably graph connected easily traversed gradual changes network topologies
thus robustness evolvable property
connectedness evolvability robust networks may general organizational principle biological networks
addition exists also rna protein structures may thus general organizational principle all biological systems
 introduction 
biochemical parameters determine behavior cellular systems proteins genome-scale regulatory networks change continually
change two principal sources
one them genetic consists mutations
other nongenetic; exemplified noise internal organism environmental change
contrast mutations relatively rare internal noise ubiquitous substantial
much consists stochastic variation gene expression expression regulation
noise makes all biochemical parameters affecting circuit's behavior appear fluctuate randomly
environmental change change temperature salinity nutrient availability similarly affect many parameters at once
observations suggest biological circuits not fine-tuned exercise their functions only precise values their biochemical parameters
instead they must able function under range different parameters
other words they must robust parameter change
insights lead explorations circuit robustness processes ranging bacterial chemotaxis embryonic development 
quantitative models cellular circuits help us understand processes different circadian rhythms cell cycle organismal development bacterial chemotaxis behavior synthetic circuitry
several classes models used represent biological networks
first class comprises differential equation models
continuous state variables equations correspond concentrations activities gene products
interactions gene products represented through biochemical parameters binding affinities transcriptional regulators dna dissociation constants ligand-receptor complexes kinetic rate constants enzymes
nearly universal problem quantitative information about biochemical parameters absent even experimentally well-studied systems
other words some knowledge topology circuit who interacts whom may exist but strengths interactions usually unknown
even where measurements biochemical parameters available they often order-of-magnitude estimates rather than quantitative measurements known precision
difficulty leads one naturally second class models only qualitative nature state variables considered
our focus here not consider any one circuit but many circuit architectures topologies
because incessant changes biochemical parameters lack quantitative information about their values approach appropriate studying fundamental properties cellular circuits; particular one may ask what features responsible robustness circuit architecture topology
work carry out analysis model transcriptional regulation networks important functions developmental processes
despite its level abstraction model proven highly successful explaining regulatory dynamics early developmental genes fruit fly drosophila well predicting mutant phenotypes
also helped elucidate why mutants often show release genetic variation cryptic wild-type how adaptive evolution robustness occurs genetic networks given topology
most recently helped explain how sexual reproduction enhance robustness recombination 
model concerned regulatory network n transcriptional regulators represented their expression patterns s at some time t during developmental cell-biological process one cell domain embryo
time scale model's expression dynamics time scale characteristic transcriptional regulation order minutes not order days weeks months complete development zygote adult
model's transcriptional regulators influence each other's expression through cross-regulatory autoregulatory interactions encapsulated matrix w elements w ij matrix indicate strength regulatory influence gene j gene i influence either activating repressing absent
put differently matrix w represents genotype system while expression state its phenotype
model change expression state s network time t progresses according difference equation where constant sigmoidal function whose values lie interval
equation reflects regulation gene i's expression other genes
here concerned networks whose expression dynamics start prespecified initial state s at some time t 0 during development arrive at prespecified stable equilibrium target expression state s will call networks viable networks
initial state determined regulatory factors upstream network may represent signals cell's environment other domains embryo
transcriptional regulators expressed stable equilibrium state s affect expression genes downstream network
modeling assumption think their expression critical course development
thus deviations s highly deleterious
because our work starts developmental framework s s play central role; contrast most studies determining generic properties random boolean networks
here examine relationship between robustness network topology millions networks different topologies
topology synonymous structure matrix w because each w's nonzero entries corresponds one regulatory interaction among circuit's genes
changes topology correspond loss regulatory interaction appearance new regulatory interaction was previously absent
topological changes occur very short evolutionary time scales particular higher eukaryotes large regulatory regions
underscores need study their effects network robustness
our analysis first ask how robustness mutations noise varies within ensemble networks different topologies
subsequently more importantly also ask whether highly robust topologies evolve topologies low robustness through gradual topological changes
