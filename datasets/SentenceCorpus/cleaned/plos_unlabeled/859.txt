 
understanding complex networks protein-protein interactions one foremost challenges post-genomic era
due recent advances experimental bio-technology including yeast-2-hybrid tandem affinity purification other high-throughput methods protein-protein interaction detection huge amounts ppi network data becoming available
major concern however levels noise incompleteness
example y2h screens thought false positive rate could high 64 percent false negative rate may range 43 percent 71 percent
tap experiments believed comparable levels noise
present novel technique assess confidence levels interactions ppi networks obtained experimental studies
use predicting new interactions thus guiding future biological experiments
technique first utilize currently best fitting network model ppi networks geometric graphs
our approach achieves specificity 85 percent sensitivity 90 percent
use assign confidence scores physical protein-protein interactions human ppi network downloaded biogrid
using our approach predict 251 interactions human ppi network statistically significant fraction correspond protein pairs sharing common go terms
moreover validate statistically significant portion our predicted interactions hprd database newer release biogrid

 introduction 
networks used model natural phenomena studied computational systems biology
nodes networks represent biomolecules genes proteins edges between nodes indicate interactions between corresponding biomolecules
interactions could many different types including functional genetic physical interactions
understanding complex networks fundamental issue systems biology
particular importance protein-protein interaction networks
ppi networks nodes correspond proteins two nodes linked edge if corresponding proteins interact
topology ppi networks give new insight into function individual proteins protein complexes cellular machinery complex system 
advances high-throughput techniques yeast-2-hybrid tandem affinity purification mass spectrometric protein complex identification producing growing amount experimental ppi data many organisms
however data produced techniques very high levels false positives false negatives
y2h screens false negative rates range 43 percent 71 percent tap false negative rates 15 percent 50 percent
false positive rates y2h could high 64 percent tap experiments they could high 77 percent
thus reducing level noise ppi networks assessing confidence each interaction essential task
two recent studies provided two high quality ppi data sets saccharomyces cerevisiae
gavin et al defined socio-affinity scores measuring log-odds number times two proteins observed together relative their frequency data set
they use not only direct bait-prey connections but also indirect prey-prey relationships
two proteins each identified preys purification third protein used bait
krogan et al used machine learning methods including bayesian networks boosted stump decision trees define confidence scores potential interactions
scores based direct bait-prey observations
they used markov clustering algorithm define protein complexes
data sets produced two groups very different thought contain many false positives
two data sets were merged into one set experimentally based ppis analyzing primary affinity purification data using purification enrichment scoring system
using set manually curated ppis they showed new data set more accurate than original individual sets comparable ppis defined using small scale experimental methods
original 12,122 interactions two studies general repository interaction data they discarded 7,504 being low confidence
applying their metric they discovered 4456 new interactions were not among original 12,122 interactions produced set 9,074 interactions accuracy comparable accuracy small scale experiments
paper use high confidence data set test our approach
recent years several random graph models been proposed model ppi networks: erd s-r nyi random graphs same degree distribution data scale-free graphs geometric random graphs stickiness-index-based models
technique presented paper one first use network model ppi networks purposes other than just generating synthetic data
demonstrate geometric graph model used assessing confidence levels known interactions ppi networks predicting novel ones
apply our technique de-noise ppi data sets detecting false positives false negative interactions
new approach compared existing ppi network post-processing techniques final section
