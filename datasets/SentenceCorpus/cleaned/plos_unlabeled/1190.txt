advent model-based geostatistics allowed maps generated formal statistical framework providing robust metrics map uncertainty enhances their utility decision-makers
many settings decision-makers require spatially aggregated measures over large regions mean prevalence within country administrative region national populations living under different levels risk
existing mbg mapping approaches provide suitable metrics local uncertainty fidelity predictions at each mapped pixel but not been adapted measuring uncertainty over large areas due largely series fundamental computational constraints
here authors present new efficient approximating algorithm generate first time necessary joint simulation prevalence values across very large prediction spaces needed global scale mapping
new approach implemented conjunction established model p falciparum allowing robust estimates mean prevalence at any specified level spatial aggregation
model used provide estimates national populations at risk under three policy-relevant prevalence thresholds along accompanying model-based measures uncertainty
overcoming previously unchallenged computational barriers study illustrates how mbg approaches already at forefront infectious disease mapping extended provide large-scale aggregate measures appropriate decision-makers
 introduction 
risk maps estimating spatial distribution infectious diseases relation underlying populations required support public health decision-making at local global scales
advancement theory increasing availability computation growing recognition importance robust handling uncertainty all contributed emergence recent years new paradigm mapping disease: use special family generalised linear models known model-based geostatistics generally implemented bayesian framework 
mbg models take point observations disease prevalence dispersed survey locations generate continuous maps interpolating prevalence at unsampled locations across raster grid surfaces
most striking advantage mbg disease mapping its handling uncertainty
interpolating sparse often imperfectly sampled survey data predict disease prevalence across wide regions results inherently uncertain risk maps level uncertainty varying spatially function density quality sample size available survey data moderated underlying spatial variability disease question
mbg approaches allow sources uncertainty propagated final mapped output predicting probability distribution prevalence at each location interest
where predictions made small uncertainty distributions will tightly concentrated around central value; where uncertainty large they will more dispersed
techniques been used generate robust informative risk maps malaria well range other infectious diseases at scales varying national global
some studies extended handling variation through space also include temporal dimension allowing disease risk modelled quantified over time well space 
implementation mbg models over even relatively small areas extremely computationally expensive
not only matrix algebra operations required generate predictions at each individual pixel costly compared simpler interpolation methods but cost must multiplied many times because prediction uncertainty evaluated generating many equally probable realisations prevalence at each pixel
implementations mbg disease models over large areas therefore tend via per-pixel computation whereby complete maps built up generating predictive realisations each pixel independently
allows computational task broken down into many small more easily manageable operations
approach yields appropriate measures local uncertainty: set realisations each pixel represents posterior predictive distribution prevalence summary statistics mean inter-quartile range 95 percent credible intervals readily extracted providing user valid uncertainty information each individual location considered isolation
there often need evaluate disease prevalence aggregated across spatial regions temporal periods combinations both
may quantify compare mean prevalence between countries administrative units example measure shift mean prevalence between start end intervention period policy change
addition mbg prevalence models used estimate derived quantities population totals living regions at different levels risk burden disease cases expected within individual countries continents function underlying prevalence quantities definition exist only over aggregated space-time units
not possible however construct posterior distributions aggregate quantities using per-pixel approach
estimate mean region made up multiple pixels uncertainty around estimate correlation between all pixels region must known
per-pixel approach each pixel modelled independent its neighbours ignoring any spatial temporal correlation
failing account correlation between pixels leads gross underestimates uncertainty aggregated quantity especially over large regions 
solution problem outlined above replace per-pixel simulation prevalence realisations simultaneous joint simulation all pixels aggregated recreating appropriate spatial temporal correlation between them
crucially set pixel values then aggregated any way used input derived aggregated quantities realisations aggregations will appropriate posterior predictive distributions
whilst conceptually simple extension local regional simulation induces fundamental computational constraint necessary calculations no longer disaggregated into separate tasks each pixel
constraint thus far prevented any use mbg disease mapping evaluation aggregate quantities over very large areas despite profound public health importance measures
where examples joint simulation mbg disease mapping exist they tend either over very small spatial regions achieved simply breaking larger regions down manually into smaller more manageable tiles

subsequent sampling posterior predictive distribution trivial: posterior predictive mean covariance refer single prediction location sampling therefore amounts drawing univariate normal distribution
total computation each pixel therefore modest cost generating maps grows simply proportion number pixels involved formula
switching per-pixel implementation joint simulation over many prediction locations increases profoundly computational challenge

put non-linear scaling context if direct joint simulation 100 100 raster grid could computed one minute 1000 1000 grid would take approximately 6 10 7 seconds
practice scaling factors along those memory storage requirements mean direct joint simulation using equations outlined above generally limited predictions at maximum around 10,000 points at least two orders magnitude too few global scale mapping at sub-10 km resolution even at single time period
