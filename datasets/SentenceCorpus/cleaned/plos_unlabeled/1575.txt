 
scientific literature represents rich source retrieval knowledge associations between biomedical concepts genes diseases cellular processes
commonly used method establish relationships between biomedical concepts literature co-occurrence
apart its use knowledge retrieval co-occurrence method also well-suited discover new hidden relationships between biomedical concepts following simple abc-principle c no direct relationship but connected via shared b-intermediates
paper describe copub discovery tool mines literature new relationships between biomedical concepts
statistical analysis using roc curves showed copub discovery performed well over wide range settings keyword thesauri
subsequently used copub discovery search new relationships between genes drugs pathways diseases
several newly found relationships were validated using independent literature sources
addition new predicted relationships between compounds cell proliferation were validated confirmed experimentally vitro cell proliferation assay
results show copub discovery able identify novel associations between genes drugs pathways diseases high probability being biologically valid
makes copub discovery useful tool unravel mechanisms behind disease find novel drug targets find novel applications existing drugs
 introduction 
wealth knowledge concerning function genes their role biological processes present biomedical literature embodied full text articles medline database
various text mining approaches been developed extract information gene function body literature been successfully applied annotate genes proteins interpretation experimental results 
common method establish relationships between biomedical concepts genes pathways co-occurrence
method built assumption biomedical concepts occurring same body text some way biologically related
co-occurrence-based methods also used discover new hidden relationships assuming if c both connected b c might also relationship even if there no published relationship between c swanson provided classic example his study he found fish-oil intake beneficial patients suffering raynaud's disease finding was confirmed experimentally few years later
hidden literature relationships used confirm hypothesis about relationship between c so called closed discovery process
process user provides hypothesis related c then tested mining literature shared biomedical concepts support hypothesis
hidden relationships also used generate novel hypotheses about relationship between c so-called open discovery process
process user provides starting point examines literature hidden relationships other biomedical concepts bridged intermediates share co-occurrences c 
tools currently available performing open discovery experiments often limited certain biomedical domains only limited number keywords describing biomedical terms retrieve hidden relationships formed uninformative concepts vitro microarray biologically less interesting
moreover bottleneck all open discovery tools identify true biologically informative hidden relationships spurious hits
previous paper described copub database co-occurrences 250.000 keywords medline abstracts
copub database statistical relevance all co-occurrences pre-computed makes possible perform statistical analyses significance retrieved hidden relationships between biomedical concepts
addition copub contains several categories controlled vocabularies genes drugs diseases etc database ideally suited use discovery hidden relationships
paper describe copub discovery method uses copub database open closed discovery hidden literature relationships
statistical analysis results using roc curves show copub discovery true hidden relationships distinguished true negatives
application method open ended retrieval hidden relations yielded novel hypotheses about gene-disease drug-disease drug-biological process relationships were validated bibliographically
moreover used copub discovery identify two novel compounds would interact cell proliferation
experimental validation showed compounds dose dependently inhibited t-cell proliferation
