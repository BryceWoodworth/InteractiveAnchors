 introduction 
adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase key regulatory allosteric enzyme involved starch biosynthesis higher plants
catalyzes rate limiting reversible reaction controls carbon-flux glucan pathway converting glucose-1-phosphate atp adp-glucose pyrophosphate using mg 2 cofactor
regulation almost all agpases depends 3-phosphoglyceric acid inorganic phosphate ratio
while 3-pga functions main stimulator pi inhibits activity enzyme
plant agpases consist pairs small large subunits thereby constituting heterotetrameric structure
two subunits encoded two distinct genes
potato tuber agpase sequence identity between different subunits 53 percent suggesting common ancestral gene
molecular weights tetrameric agpases range 200 240 kda depending tissue plant species
specifically molecular weights ls ss potato tuber agpase 51 kda 50 kda respectively
was found ss ls different roles enzyme functionality
ss was shown both catalytic regulatory functions whereas ls mainly responsible regulating allosteric properties ss
results were also supported studies showed ls was incapable assembling into catalytically active oligomeric structure whereas ss was able form homotetramer catalytic properties
however ss homotetramer showed defective properties terms catalysis regulation
required higher concentrations 3-pga activation was more sensitive pi inhibition
results suggested ls was essential enzyme function efficiently
alternatively recent studies indicated ls may bind substrates glucose-1 phosphate atp
binding ls substrates may allow ls interact cooperatively catalytic ss binding substrates effectors turn influence net catalysis
addition specific regions both ls ss were found important subunit association enzyme stability
also using chimeric maize/potato small subunits cross et al found polymorphic motif ss critical subunit interaction
they concluded 55-amino acid region between residues 322 376 directly interacts ls significantly contributes overall enzyme stability
recently crystal structure ss was found homotetrameric form jin et al
neither ls nor heterotetrameric agpase structure been solved yet
due difficulty obtaining agpase stable form
however critical elucidate native heterotetrameric agpase structure identify key residues taking place subunit-subunit interactions obtain more detailed picture enzyme
understanding structure hot spot residues subunit interface will enable us manipulate native enzyme get stable form utilized improving yield crops
feasibility approach been shown previously
modeled ls structure potato tuber agpase proposed model heterotetrameric agpase
study extended our previous work examining our agpase model identify important residues mediating interactions between ls ss both computational experimental techniques
based molecular mechanics generalized born surface area method two distinct ls domains involved ls-ss subunit interaction
residues potato agpase ls asn 97 pro 327 ile 330 ile 335 ile 339 ile 340 his 342 involved lateral interaction potato agpase ss whereas residues arg 45 arg 88 arg 92 trp 135 involved longitudinal interaction potato agpase ss
effect mutations interactions ls ss potato agpase were further characterized vivo using bacterial complementation yeast two-hybrid methods
also experimental results indicated backbone g binding energy interface amino acids decisive parameter subunit-subunit interaction rather than side chain g binding total g binding energies
study will highlight important structural aspects agpase structure provide insights further attempts engineer more functional form enzyme
