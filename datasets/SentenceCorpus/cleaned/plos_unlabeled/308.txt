 
persistent activity states observed several neocortical areas after removal sensory stimulus believed neuronal basis working memory
one possible mechanisms underlie persistent activity recurrent excitation mediated intracortical synaptic connections
recent experimental study revealed connections between pyramidal cells prefrontal cortex exhibit various degrees synaptic depression facilitation
here analyze effect synaptic dynamics emergence persistence attractor states interconnected neural networks
show different combinations synaptic depression facilitation result qualitatively different network dynamics respect emergence attractor states
analysis raises possibility framework attractor neural networks extended represent time-dependent stimuli
 introduction 
working memory enables us hold trace fleeting stimulus few seconds after gone thus enabling manipulation information over time
recordings neurons monkeys performing working memory tasks reveal stimulus-selective spiking activity persists after removal stimulus
persistent activity states considered neuronal substrate working memory 
sustained persistent activity believed achieved excitatory interpyramidal connections either prewired formed during learning task
vitro studies connections cortex revealed pronounced short-term plasticity effects
sensory areas cortex dominant effect synaptic depression expressed rapid decay synaptic efficacy following presynaptic firing
several theoretical studies investigated effects synaptic depression existence stability attractor states
wang et al recently performed experiments investigate short-term synaptic plasticity prefrontal cortex one cortical areas where persistent activity observed
they found interpyramidal connections area exhibit various degrees synaptic facilitation three different classes connections identified
while synaptic facilitation was recently mentioned stabilizing factor network attractors there yet no systematic study its effect dynamics recurrent neural networks undergoing transition background persistent states after presentation stimulus
contribution consider attractor neural network connections already been formed learning several stimuli
assume network comprises set neuronal populations each responding primarily certain stimulus
scheme via hebbian learning strengthen synaptic connections within population form stable activity state
drawing recent experimental results assume neurons within each population differ dynamic properties their synapses thus exhibit different temporal response profiles same stimuli
firing then lead further differentiation synaptic strengths within population whereby neurons similar synaptic dynamics connected more strongly one another than ones dissimilar synaptic dynamics
thus consider network comprising several attractor populations each divided into subpopulations different synaptic dynamics
populations interact via both excitatory dynamic synapses inhibition generate rich dynamics response external stimuli
since synaptic dynamics differ between subpopulations expect them respond differently different temporal profiles input could result greater computational power network
