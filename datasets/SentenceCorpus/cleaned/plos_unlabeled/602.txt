 
previous model-based analysis metabolic network geobacter sulfurreducens suggested existence several redundant pathways
here identified eight sets redundant pathways included redundancy assimilation acetate conversion pyruvate into acetyl-coa
equivalent pathways two other sub-optimal pathways were studied using 5 single-gene deletion mutants those pathways evaluation predictive capacity model
growth phenotypes mutants were studied under 12 different conditions electron donor acceptor availability
comparison model predictions resulting experimental phenotypes indicated pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase only activity able convert pyruvate into acetyl-coa
however results modeling showed two acetate activation pathways present not only active but needed due additional role acetyl-coa transferase tca cycle probably reflecting adaptation bacteria acetate utilization
other cases data reconciliation suggested additional capacity constraints were confirmed biochemical assays
results demonstrate need experimentally verify activity key enzymes when developing silico models microbial physiology based sequence-based reconstruction metabolic networks
 introduction 
geobacter species interest because their natural role carbon mineral cycling their ability remediate organic metal contaminants subsurface their capacity harvest electricity waste organic matter
geobacter sulfurreducens most commonly investigated species genus because genetic system complete genome sequence whole genome microarrays genome-scale proteomics available
furthermore functional genomics studies provided insight into mechanisms extracellular electron transport onto important electron acceptors fe oxides electrodes 
g
sulfurreducens use either acetate hydrogen sole electron donors fe reduction fumarate malate also used terminal electron acceptors
understanding acetate metabolism geobacter species required because acetate secreted fermenting organisms dominant electron donor geobacteraceae soils sediments because recent studies shown addition acetate uranium-contaminated aquifers stimulate situ bioremediation uranium contamination geobacter species
previous studies demonstrated geobacter species closely related desulfuromonas acetoxidans oxidize acetate via tca cycle
however many other aspects acetate metabolism central metabolism general still poorly understood
better understand physiology g sulfurreducens constraint-based genome-scale metabolic model was constructed used investigate unique physiology associated reduction extracellular electron acceptors fe
genome-scale model enabled assessment impact global proton balance during fe reduction biomass energy yields successfully predicted lower biomass yields observed during growth mutant fumarate reductase had been deleted 
furthermore network reconstruction revealed existence number redundant alternate pathways central metabolism g sulfurreducens
recent genetic silico studies shown presence redundant metabolic pathways well isozymes enable metabolic networks withstand genetic perturbations
experimental evidence alternate optimal pathways been observed e coli where four metabolic gene deletion mutants had significantly different metabolic flux distributions but similar overall growth rates
hence systematic investigation role redundant pathways using silico models provide key insights into properties metabolic networks
here report coupled computational experimental evaluation potential redundant pathways during acetate metabolism g sulfurreducens
demonstrate need redundancy acetate assimilation pathways due coupling between tca cycle acetate activation acetyl-coa also inactivity some predicted alternatives pyruvate oxidation acetyl-coa
also show using information constrain model its predictive capacity improved
