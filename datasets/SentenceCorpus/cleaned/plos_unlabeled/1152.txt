 introduction 
accurate species trees model evolutionary histories sets species play central role comparative genomics conservation studies analyses population divergence among many other applications
traditionally species tree inferred sequencing single locus group species its tree known gene tree reconstructed using method maximum likelihood tree declared species tree
underlying assumption obviously gene tree species tree identical hence reconstructing former amounts learning latter
however biologists long recognized assumption not necessarily always valid
nevertheless due limitations sequencing technologies approach remained standard method until very recently
advent whole-genome sequencing complete genomes various organisms becoming increasingly available particularly important data multiple loci organisms becoming available
availability data allowed analyzing multiple loci various groups species
analyses many cases uncovered widespread incongruence among gene trees same set organisms
therefore while reconstructing gene tree requires considering process nucleotide substitution reconstructing species tree requires addition considering process resulted incongruities among gene trees so species phylogeny inferred reconciling incongruities
paper address problem efficient inference accurate species trees multiple loci when gene trees assumed correct their incongruence assumed exclusively due lineage sorting
also address integration horizontal gene transfer potential cause gene tree incongruence into framework
let us illustrate process lineage sorting way causes gene tree incongruence
evolutionary perspective barring any recombination evolutionary history set genomes would depicted tree same tree models evolution each gene genomes
however events recombination break linkage among different parts genome those unlinked parts may take different paths through phylogeny results gene trees differ species tree well each other due lineage sorting
widespread gene tree incongruence due lineage sorting been shown recently several groups closely related organisms including yeast drosophila staphylococcus aureus apicomplexan
case gene trees need reconciled within branches species tree shown figure 1
few methods been introduced recently analyzing gene trees reconciling their incongruities inferring species trees despite incongruities
generally speaking each methods follows one two approaches: combined analysis approach separate analysis approach; see figure 2
combined analysis aproach sequences multiple loci concatenated resulting supergene data set analyzed using traditional phylogenetic methods maximum parsimony maximum likelihood; e.g
separate analysis approach sequence data each locus first analyzed individually reconciliation gene trees then sought
one way reconcile gene trees taking their majority consensus; e.g
another democratic vote method entails taking tree topology occurring highest frequency among all gene trees species tree
shortcomings methods based two approaches been analyzed various researchers
recently bayesian methods following separate analysis approach been developed
while methods firm statistical basis they very time consuming taking hours days even moderate-size data sets limits their scalability 
maddison proposed parsimony-based approach inferring species trees gene trees minimizing number extra lineages minimizing deep coalesces
heuristic approach was later described
than et al provided two-stage heuristic inferring species tree under mdc criterion
however no exact solutions computing mdc criterion exist
paper provide formal definition notion extra lineages first described
then present exact solutions integer linear programming algorithm dynamic programming algorithm finding optimal species tree topology set gene tree topologies under mdc criterion
our solutions based two central observations: species tree maximal clique compatibility graph set species clusters quantifying amount incongruence between set gene trees species tree obtained simple counting lineages within branches species tree
accuracy computational efficiency solutions demonstrate allow analysis genome-scale data sets analysis large numbers data sets those involved simulation studies
given mdc parsimonious explanation incongruence data imperative sub-optimal solutions considered
computational efficiency our solutions allow rapid exploration sub-optimal solutions
last but not least exact solutions allow us empirically study properties mdc optimality criterion inferring species tree
implemented both exact solutions phylonet software package 
reanalyze apicomplexan data set yeast data set large number synthetic data sets species/gene trees simulated using mesquite tool
each data set our method computed species tree at most few seconds produced very accurate species trees show
case apicomplexan data set provide tree slightly different one proposed authors discuss tree
yeast data set obtain tree identical one proposed authors well other studies
addition quality species trees efficiency our method inferred them one advantage our method used exploratory fashion screen multiple species tree candidates study reconciliation scenarios within branches each them
illustrate utility capability yeast apicomplexan data sets
further apicomplexan data set illustrate how screen possible horizontal gene transfer events using reconciliation scenarios computed other methods
using synthetic data sets study statistical consistency well convergence rate mdc criterion
also show may sufficient consider only set clusters induced gene trees practice may much smaller than set all clusters species thus achieving further reduction computation time
nonetheless present example illustrate certain cases focusing only gene tree clusters may result sub-optimal species tree under mdc
computational efficiency our methods coupled promising properties mdc criterion makes our methods particularly applicable large genome-scale data sets
