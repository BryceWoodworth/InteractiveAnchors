 introduction 
classic debates nature vs nurture innate vs learned pervasive literature early visual development
variety studies shown visual system requires external experience mature
other hand many animals able see at birth functioning primary visual cortex even before eye opening
might seem straightforward assign properties found at birth innate properties dependent visual experience learned
however strict dichotomy may unnecessarily limit our integrated understanding visual development
particular wish focus issue form learning occurs before birth patterns activity generated internally
well known spontaneous endogenous activity necessary permissive proper development visual system
point paper discuss statistical aspects activity may sufficient instructive guide development much same way visual experience refines mature visual system
essentially propose innate learning approach prepares system later experienced-based refinement diplomatic balance between nature nurture
several studies shown early stages rat visual development retinal neurons spontaneously active correlated their bursting patterns activity
later retinal wave patterns were recorded many animals calcium imaging developing retina one example shown figure 1a
experiments since then manipulated waves abolishing them over-stimulating them otherwise altering their properties shown how they necessary proper development
several models been proposed production waves
two most recent models cholinergic amacrine cells mediate activity general agreement about mechanism
neurons begin bursting spontaneously while neighboring cells recruited if enough cells local area also bursting
rules wave formation propagation biologically plausible models retinal wave formation been able create complex images those figure 1b
although retinal spontaneous activity been well studied many areas beyond retina exhibit patterned spontaneous neural activity
visual system both lgn v1 patterned spontaneous activity during development
effects lgn v1 connectivity been analyzed functionally layer segregation orientation column formation
patterned spontaneous activity also known occur developing auditory system necessary proper development
similar developmental mechanisms also found hippocampus spinal cord
biophysical perspective been shown spontaneous neural activity necessary mediate many mechanistic effects axon branching dendritic patterning synaptic pruning
ubiquity spontaneous activity development its ability affect various aspects neural connectivity understanding general role spontaneous activity early visual development likely implications beyond vision
adult primary visual cortex been known nearly half century v1 cells respond strongly bars edges later experiments demonstrating simple cells v1 characteristic filter description much like 2d gabor function shown figure 2a
v1 cell specific elongated subregions visual space where relatively bright dark parts visual image will stimulate cell
note characterization purely descriptive stimulus-response paradigm answering what neuron responds instead why filters appearance
according efficient coding hypothesis role early visual system remove statistical redundancy visual code
hypothesis one way understand visual system develop analyze visual encoding scheme remove redundancy images natural scenes
was done using sparse coding independent components analysis set natural images pictures rocks trees forest scenes etc
derived filters resemble 2d gabor filters found v1 simple cells see figure 2b-c
one conclude results v1 developed tuned efficiently encode visual world
paper make claim there parsimonious computational reason existence spontaneous patterns  functional strategy early visual system employ guide development both prior throughout experience
addition molecular guidance cues believe visual code refined training patterns spontaneous activity during development similar manner how juvenile animals refine visual code statistical patterns found natural images
many statistical structure models rely pairwise correlations between neighboring units implicit assumption other functional descriptions spontaneous activity
however many efficient coding models applied natural images sparse coding ica rely statistics beyond pairwise correlations
fact often first step correlations removed process known decorrelation whitening ; process at least part considered function retinal ganglion cells
although developmental activity patterns known relevant pairwise correlations argue receptive field refinement may also rely higher-order statistics thus bridging gap between models sparse efficient coding spontaneous activity
will demonstrate simple patterns activity used training images refining visual code
patterns use resemble only 2d imaged spontaneous activity available retinal waves; demonstrated figure 1 specific examples our generated patterns figure 1d
beyond visual resemblance our pattern generation technique also abstracts general properties parameters current retinal wave models
strongly note however strictly not retinal wave model but abstraction what believe essential features relevant endogenous activity
more concerned paper statistical nature produced activity than its precise localization including whether activity originates one particular area part larger dynamical system
example comparison retinal waves lgn/v1 spontaneous activity more direct influence cortical receptive field formation
ferrets lgn remains spontaneously active at beginning v1 activation while v1 activity retinal wave production do not significantly overlap time
lgn v1 activity been experimentally characterized but far less understood than retinal activity thus prompting our analogies retinal waves paper
our patterns generated using variant traditional site percolation models  analogy retinal wave propagation its relation physiological models detailed discussion section
models common study critical phenomena physics percolation models ising model been used artificial neural networks understanding adult retinal neurons equally useful understanding models development
ising models example been adapted artificial neural networks since hopfield's network
recent work also shown ising models apt analogies maximal entropy high-predictability neural firing retina upon natural stimulation
although pattern generation technique use quite similar networks been shown relevant biologically demonstrate desirable statistical properties
main goal paper show how same adaptive efficient algorithm applied both natural inputs well spontaneous activity
show certain wavefront-containing patterns possess relevant statistics percolation network provides useful abstraction demonstrating property
patterns independent how they were generated simply used existence proof possible training role spontaneous activity
first will show our generated patterns qualitatively resemble known patterns spontaneous activity
will then compare various methods learning v1 receptive fields showing how both natural images spontaneous activity patterns used produce v1-like gabor filters
will also demonstrate how significant variations receptive field properties occur even at threshold scale invariance showing flexibility learning even simplified model
finally one main points paper expressed final figure relevant statistics sensory coding go beyond simple correlations
there higher-order statistics still present after decorrelation
sparse independent efficient coding algorithms rely statistics found natural scenes also present particular amorphous wavefront-containing structure spontaneous activity patterns
will present how fact points conclusion same adaptive coding strategy may then present both before during visual experience
