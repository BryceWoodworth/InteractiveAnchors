 
when coordinating movements nervous system often decide how distribute work across number redundant effectors
here show humans solve problem trying minimize both variability motor output effort involved
previous studies investigated temporal shape movements two selective pressures despite having very different theoretical implications could not distinguished; because noise motor system increases motor commands minimization effort variability leads very similar predictions
when multiple effectors different noise effort characteristics combined however two cost terms dissociated
here measure importance variability effort coordination studying how humans share force production between two fingers
capture variability identified coefficient variation index little fingers
effort used sum squared forces sum squared forces normalized maximum strength each effector
terms were then used predict optimal force distribution task participants had produce target total force 4 16 n pressing onto two isometric transducers using different combinations fingers
comparing predicted distribution across fingers actual distribution chosen participants were able estimate relative importance variability effort 1 7 unnormalized effort being most important
our results indicate nervous system uses multi-effector redundancy minimize both variability produced output effort although effort costs clearly outweighed variability costs
 introduction 
motor system highly redundant: same task always accomplished many different sequences motor commands
part redundancy caused fact there often multiple muscles effectors produce same desired effect
thus case multi-effector redundancy brain choose how distribute given task across set muscles
despite infinite number possibilities motor system appears prefer particular solutions
example when moving wrist combine action different forearm muscles predictable cosine-tuning-like fashion
explain regularities ask why brain coordinating movements way i.e propose hypothetical cost function biological system minimized over course learning
determining form cost function assuming nervous system had sufficient exploration task dynamics find optimal solution make testable predictions about how biological movements should produced under given task constraint
number different cost functions biological movements been proposed
most studies addressed movements redundancy temporal: here there may only one muscle desired effect but there still many different ways distributing motor commands over movement period
example all possible shapes arm eye movement motor system consistently chooses bell-shaped velocity profile 
different components cost functions generally divided into two classes: effort variability costs
effort costs usually take form sum squared muscle activations motor commands
alternatively both harris wolpert burdet milner proposed nervous system chooses sequence motor commands minimizes variability at endpoint movement
under assumption signal-dependent noise i.e noise increases monotonically motor command model predict important characteristics control both arm eye
while effort variability costs different theoretical implications learning mechanism involved optimization motor behaviours they make very similar predictions concerning temporal shape optimal movement
indeed shown requirement reduce variability under signal dependent noise leads term cost function penalizes sum squared motor commands over movement identically term commonly associated effort
thus motor behaviours mainly temporal redundancy variability effort costs hard dissociate
motor behaviours multi-effector redundancy however minimization variability costs minimization effort costs lead substantially different predictions concerning distribution work across effectors because noise effort characteristics different effectors partly independent
here study how humans distribute work across different fingers when they produce given target force
measuring independent noise characteristics maximal force finger dissociate influence variability effort costs coordination
