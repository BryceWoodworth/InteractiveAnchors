here address question modelling not human physiology perception directly typically case but our natural visual world need robust behaviour
artificial neural networks were trained predict reflectance surfaces synthetic ecology consisting 3-d dead-leaves scenes under non-uniform illumination
networks learned solve task accurately robustly given only ambiguous sense data
addition direct consequence their experience networks also made systematic errors their behaviour commensurate human illusions includes brightness contrast assimilation although assimilation only emerged when virtual ecology included 3-d opposed 2-d scenes
subtle variations illusions also found human perception were observed asymmetry brightness contrast
data suggest illusions arise humans because natural stimuli ambiguous ambiguity resolved empirically encoding statistical relationship between images scenes past visual experience
since resolving stimulus ambiguity challenge faced all visual systems corollary findings human illusions must experienced all visual animals regardless their particular neural machinery
data also provide more formal definition illusion: condition true source stimulus differs what its most likely source
illusions not fundamentally different non-illusory percepts all being direct manifestations statistical relationship between images scenes
 introduction 
understanding how generate accurate perceptions surfaces often best informed understanding why sometimes do not
thus illusions lightness essential tools vision research
many natural environments light levels vary across space over time
important able perceive surfaces independently varying light intensity order forage predate successfully example
number models lightness perception been proposed but most fail deal complex stimuli only demonstrate narrow range behaviours
instance one well-known heuristic model predicts human lightness perceptions first subdividing stimuli into multiple local frameworks based instance junction analysis co-planarity well other classic gestalt factors
then within each framework ratio patch's intensity maximum intensity patch's local framework used predict reflectance combining bright white large white area rule
rules well-defined effective simple stimuli but application rule not been studied more complex images
indeed hard see how model could applied even moderately complex stimuli much less natural scenes under spatially heterogeneous illumination without extremely complex edge-classification rules yet undefined
furthermore human-based heuristics provide little insight into physiological and/or computational principles vision relevant all visual animals
more computational approaches other hand less descriptive more quantitative make fewer assumptions
example artificial neural networks been trained extract scene information object shape movement simple synthetic images ; statistical approach using gibbs sampling markov random fields been used separate reflectance illumination simple images
most models however unable explain brightness contrast assimilation simultaneously without recourse one more adjustable weighting factors
one approach blakeslee mccourt filter model
applying set filters model produces results correspond closely psychophysical results wide range illusory stimuli
same model however fails predict asymmetry brightness contrast where darker surrounds cause larger illusions than equally lighter surrounds discuss later
while asymmetries not captured odog model presently implemented permitting different gain parameters applied outputs independent on-channels off-channels would constitute logical first step toward accommodating differences
also important stress model does not attempt predict reflectance surfaces only perceived brightness stimulus therefore unable explain lightness constancy more natural scenes under spatially heterogeneous illumination
related machine vision work includes separation luminance changes into those caused shading those caused paint surface using filters mixture gaussians ; localised mixture experts set multiscale filters been used extract intrinsic components image including de-noising
however studies do not attempt explain human perception lightness illusions
thus explanations why how see lightness illusions remain incomplete
here take different approach rationalising human illusions extension lightness perception generally
rather than modelling human perception known primate physiology typical most models instead model empirical process vision resolves most fundamental challenge visual ecology: inherent ambiguity visual stimuli
make no assumptions about particular physiology cognition but instead model process development/learning stimuli feedback environment
analogous experiential learning any animal whose behaviour guided visually must learn resolve perceptual ambiguity order survive
