 introduction 
needleman wunsch pairwise sequence alignment known sensitive parameter choices
illustrate problem consider eighth intron drosophila melanogaster cg9935-ra gene located chr4:660,462 660,522
intron 61 base pairs long 60 base pair ortholog drosophila pseudoobscura
ortholog located at contig8094 contig5509:4,876 4,935 august 2003 freeze 1 assembly produced baylor genome sequencing center
using basic 3-parameter scoring scheme two orthologous introns following optimal alignment when parameters set m 5 x 5 s 5:
however if change parameters m 5 x 6 s 4 then following alignment optimal:
note relatively small change parameters produces very different alignment introns
problem exacerbated more complex scoring schemes central issue whole genome alignments produced programs mavid blastz/multiz
indeed although whole genome alignment systems use many heuristics rapidly identifying alignable regions subsequently aligning them they all rely needleman wunsch algorithm at some level
dependence parameters becomes even more crucial issue multiple alignment more than two sequences
parametric alignment was introduced waterman eggert lander further developed gusfield et al fernandez-baca et al approach overcoming difficulties selecting parameters needleman wunsch alignment
see review algebraic perspective
parametric alignment amounts partitioning space parameters into regions
parameters same region lead same optimal alignments
enumerating all regions non-trivial problem computational geometry
solve problem whole genome scale up five free parameters
our approach parametric alignment rests idea score alignment specified short list numbers derived alignment
instance given standard three-parameter scoring scheme summarize each alignment number m matches number x mismatches number s spaces alignment
triple called alignment summary
example consider above pair orthologous drosophila introns
first alignment alignment summary while second alignment alignment summary 
remarkably even though number all alignments two sequences very large number alignment summaries arise needleman wunsch alignment very small
specifically example above where two sequences lengths 61 60 total number alignments 1,511,912,317,060,120,757,519,610,968,109,962,170,434,175,129 1.5 10 46
there only 13 alignment summaries highest score some choice parameters m,x,s biologically reasonable choices i.e when require m x 2s x only six 13 summaries optimal
six summaries account total 8,362 optimal alignments 
note basic model discussed above only d 2 free parameters because pair sequences lengths l,l all summaries satisfy
relation holds l l six summaries table 1
figure 1 shows alignment polygon defined section alignment polytopes coordinates 
general two dna sequences lengths l l number optimal alignment summaries bounded above polynomial l l degree d/ where d number free parameters model
d 2 degree 0.667 so number optimal alignment summaries sublinear growth relative sequence lengths
even d 5 growth exponent d/ only 3.333
means all optimal alignment summaries computed large scale models few parameters
growth exponent d/ was derived gusfield et al d 2 fernandez-baca at al pachter-sturmfels general d table 1 computed using software xparal
software works d 2 d 3 generates representation all optimal alignments respect all reasonable choices parameters
although xparal convenient graphical interface seems program not been widely used biologists perhaps because not designed high throughput data analysis number free parameters restricted d 3
paper demonstrate parametric sequence alignment made practical whole-genome scale argue computing output table 1 very useful comparative genomics applications where reliable alignments essential
end introduce mathematical point view based organizing principle convexity was absent earlier studies
our advances rely new algorithms quite different what implemented xparal perform well practice even if number d free parameters greater than three
convexity organizing principle reveals needles haystack
our example haystack consists more than 10 46 alignments needles 8,362 optimal alignments
summaries optimal alignments vertices alignment polytope
alignment polytope convex hull summaries all alignments
background convex hulls how compute alignment polytopes provided section genomes polytopes
thus parametric alignment two dna sequences relative some chosen pair hidden markov model means constructing alignment polytope two sequences
dimension alignment polytope d number free model parameters
d 2 polytope convex polygon shown figure 1 pair introns above

orthology mapping problem pair genomes identify all orthologous segments between two genomes
orthologous segments if selected so not contain genome rearrangements then globally aligned each other
strategy frequently used whole genome alignment adapted our parametric alignment computation
mercator orthology mapping program suitable multiple genomes was developed dewey et al
applied program d melanogaster d pseudoobscura genomes identify pieces parametric alignment
mercator strategy identifying orthologous segments follows
exon annotations each genome translated into amino acid sequences then compared each other using blat
annotations based reference gene sets ab initio predictions
resulting exon hits then used build graph whose vertices correspond exons edge between two exons if there good hit
greedy algorithm then used select edges graph correspond runs exons consistent order orientation
mercator orthology map d melanogaster d pseudoobscura 2,731 segments
however order obtain map suitable parametric alignment further subdivision segments was necessary
subdivision was accomplished additional step identifying fixing exact matches length at least 10 bp 
derived 1,116,792 constraints four possible types: exact matching non-coding sequences ungapped high scoring aligned coding sequences segment pairs between two other constraints where one segments length zero so non-trivial segment must gapped single nucleotide mismatches squeezed between other constraints
then removed all segments where sequences contained letter n process resulted 877,982 pairs segments parametric alignment
lengths d melanogaster segments range one 80,676 base pairs
median length 42 bp mean length 99 bp
all 90.4 percent d melanogaster genome 88.7 percent d pseudoobscura genome were aligned our method
