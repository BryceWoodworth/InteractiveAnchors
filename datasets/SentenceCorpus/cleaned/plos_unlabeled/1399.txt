 introduction 
eukaryotes interphase nucleus organized into distinct nuclear compartments defined macroscopic regions within nucleus morphologically and/or functionally distinct their surrounding
complex relationships between spatial organization compartments regulation genome function been previously described
furthermore changes nuclear architecture among most significant features differentiation development malignant processes
thus findings question whether topological landmarks and/or nuclear organization principles exist if so whether architectural principles identical animal plant kingdoms
investigate nuclear organization principles multidisciplinary approaches required based image analysis computational biology spatial statistics
spatial distributions several compartments proteinaceous bodies genomic domains been analyzed
chromosome territories areas genetic content individual chromosomes confined usually radially distributed gene-rich chromosomes more centrally located than gene-poor chromosomes
some studies report chromosome size could also influence ct location
centromeres may close nuclear periphery those located chromosomes bearing ribosomal genes generally tethered nucleolar periphery
transcription sites well early replicating foci assumed correspond active chromatin more centrally located whereas inactive heterochromatin tends at nuclear periphery
at finer level active genes widely separated cis located different chromosomes colocalize active transcription sites whereas proximity centromeric heterochromatin nuclear periphery generally associated gene silencing
changes transcriptional status genes been frequently associated their repositioning nucleus relative their cts nuclear periphery repressive centromeric heterochromatin
furthermore large reorganization nuclear architecture accompany some differentiation development malignant processes natural variations 
however still remains difficult extract common rules establish comparisons due various limitations
indeed most data been gathered limited sets nuclear elements isolated plant cell nuclei nuclei immortalized animal cell lines outside their physiological environment except circulating blood cells
little known about possible differences nuclear organization cells within their tissue
some studies compared nuclear organization primary cells versus cell lines cell lines versus tissues 2d culture versus 3d cultures; studies suggested tissue architecture involved control nuclear organization
addition data nuclear organization plant cell nuclei situ rare
finally few three-dimensional studies quantitative measures been performed investigate spatial nuclear organization 
statistics used analyze data were mostly based radial patterns nuclear elements genes chromosome territories centromeres
radial positions been measured respect nuclear geometric center nuclear envelope
spatial affinity between several elements been investigated spatial correlations been assessed through central angles example between radii joining homologous chromosome territory centers nuclear center
alternative approaches based distances between elements been developed
distances between small number elements like two pairs homologous alleles were used testing spatial attraction repulsion
remarkably spatial statistics tools distance functions been developed ecology epidemiology analyzing spatial point patterns rarely been applied nuclear organization studies
example nearest-neighbor distances been used analyze large numbers nuclear elements molecular complexes pml bodies rna polymerase ii foci
alternatively all pairwise inter-distances been used analyze spatial distribution chromocenters nucleocapsids 
spatial statistics data usually collected through sampling window over single realization point process
point process generally considered unbounded spatially homogeneous
theoretical framework makes sense applications investigated phenomenon extends far beyond observed region
contrast analyses nuclear spatial patterns based images entire nuclei: whole domain interest observed
furthermore one should not consider observed nuclear patterns realizations spatially homogeneous point processes
another difference replicated data available analysis carried out sample nuclei
recently distance functions been extended replicated spatially heterogeneous point patterns
instance extended f-function been used analyzing spatial patterns transmissible spongiform encephalopathy lesions brain tissue
extended f-function takes into account expected spatial heterogeneity point process intensity
estimate intensity replicated patterns first registered locate all observed points common coordinate system
however type preliminary registration not possible nuclei due lack identifiable nuclear landmarks
hence further developments required make spatial statistics tools appropriate nuclear spatial organization studies
study develop approach furthering analysis nuclear spatial organization
spatial distributions nuclear compartments were quantified using cumulative distribution functions nearest-neighbor distances distances between arbitrary points within nucleus their nearest compartment
analysis g f-functions was designed specifically cope patterns observed non-registered variable domains
applied new approach investigation 3d distribution centric/pericentric heterochromatin five interphase nuclei populations belonging animal plant kingdoms
centric/pericentric compartment was chosen due its dual structural regulatory functions
indeed usually behaves transcription repressor essential genome organization proper segregation genetic information during cell division
compartment often clusters forms chromocenters
studied nuclei cells at various differentiation stages three biological systems: rabbit embryos at 8-cell blastocyst stages differentiated rabbit mammary epithelial cells during lactation differentiated cells thaliana plantlets
found non-completely random significantly more regularly spaced patterns than expected under complete randomness centric/pericentric heterochromatin compartment five differentiated cell populations suggesting existence inter-kingdom nuclear organizational rules possible nuclear regularities
