 introduction 
dynamic cellular processes response signaling event governed complex transcriptional regulatory networks
networks typically involve large number transcription factors activated different combinations order produce particular cellular response
macrophage vital cell type mammalian immune system marshals variety phenotypic responses pathogenic challenge secretion pro-inflammatory mediators phagocytosis antigen presentation stimulation mucus production adherence
innate immune system first line defense against infection macrophage's toll-like receptors play crucial role recognizing distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns flagellin lipopeptides double-stranded rna
tlr signals first channeled through adapter molecules then through parallel cross-talking signal pathways
activated pathways initiate transcriptional program over 1,000 genes hundreds tf genes differentially expressed tailored type infection
transcriptional network underlying macrophage activation exhibit many distinct steady-states associated tissue infection-specific macrophage functions
transcriptional response also dynamic characterized temporal waves gene activation each enriched distinct sets gene functions likely controlled different combinations transcriptional regulators
long-term elucidating transcriptional network underlying tlr-stimulated macrophage activation identifying key regulators their functions would greatly enhance our understanding innate immune response infection potentially yield new ideas vaccine development
computational analysis high-throughput experimental data proving increasingly useful inference transcriptional regulatory interaction networks identification prioritization potential regulators targeted experimental validation
time-course microarray expression measurements been used infer dynamic transcriptional networks yeast static influence networks mammalian cell lines
context primary macrophages expression-based computational reconstruction transcriptional control logic underlying activation program not straightforward progress difficult measure several reasons
first transcriptional control within mammalian networks general key tlr-responsive genes particular combinatorial
second many induced tfs subject post-translational activation dynamic control nuclear localization
third targeted genetic perturbations presently infeasible perform large scale mammalian animal model expression knockdown difficult macrophages due tendency vector stimulate tlrs
finally few transcriptional regulatory interactions been validated through targeted experiments tlr-stimulated primary macrophages not available single gold standard dataset
therefore context transcriptional regulation mammalian macrophage presently accessible expression data sets large-scale computational inference primarily useful statistically identifying potential regulatory interactions rather than inference tool predicting transcriptional control logic specific target genes
reasons described above order computationally infer transcriptional regulatory interactions mammalian system necessary include additional sources evidence constrain inform transcriptional network model selection
computational scanning promoter sequences clusters co-expressed genes known transcription factor binding site motifs proved particularly valuable when combined global expression data
recently nilsson et al used combination expression clustering promoter sequence scanning tfbs motifs construct initial transcriptional network macrophage stimulated tlr4 stimulus lipopolysaccharide
their work identified two novel regulators but clustering was based expression dataset single stimulus limited biological replicates few time points
moreover tfbs motif scanning co-expressed clusters without utilizing expression dynamics provides only limited static picture underlying transcriptional network
many tfbs motifs often recognized multiple tfs making difficult unambiguous identification regulating tf tfbs enrichment alone
furthermore because tendency tfbs motifs co-occur difficult determine among set co-occurring motifs associated tf most relevant condition-specific regulation target cluster
tlr-stimulated macrophage core transcription factors already expressed cell rapidly activated initiate transcriptional regulation second wave tf genes
transcriptionally regulated tf genes key candidates integrated analysis combining tf-specific dynamic expression data sequence-based motif scanning data
work concerned using computational data integration identify set core differentially expressed transcriptional regulators tlr-stimulated macrophage form statistical associations clusters co-expressed genes they may regulate
clusters differentiated based temporal stimulus-specific activation sense inferred associations constitute preliminary dynamic transcriptional network tlr-stimulated macrophage
achieve used novel computational approach incorporating tfbs motif scanning statistical inference based time-course expression data across diverse array stimuli
our approach involved four steps
set genes was identified were differentially expressed wild-type macrophages under at least one tlr stimulation experiment
genes were clustered based their expression profiles across wide range conditions strains grouping genes based similarity timing stimulus-dependence their induction
gene ontology annotations were used identify functional categories enriched within gene clusters
promoter sequences upstream genes within each cluster were scanned library tfbs motifs each recognized at least one differentially expressed tf identify possible associations between tfs gene clusters
across eleven different time-course studies dynamic expression profiles tf genes target genes were compared order identify possible causal influences between differentially expressed tf genes clusters
several techniques been developed specifically model inference time-course expression data notably dynamic bayesian networks ode-based model selection
however parametric complexity model classes makes difficult apply them infer network underlying specific cellular perturbation limited expression dataset
here potential transcriptional regulatory influence inferred time-course expression data using time-lagged correlation statistic been used infer biochemical interaction networks well transcriptional networks
tlc advantage accounts time delay between differential expression induced tf differential expression target gene
contrast standard correlation-based methods identify co-expressed genes tlc method uses temporal ordering expression determine whether time lag between two correlated genes consistent causal interaction
developed novel method identify optimal time lag each gene pair used prior probability distribution transcriptional time delays score possible interactions
combining promoter scanning-based evidence evidence obtained time-lagged correlation analysis expression data were able identify network statistically significant associations between 36 tf genes 27 co-expressed clusters
overall 63 percent differentially expressed genes included network
network provided insights into temporal organization transcriptional response into combinations tfs may act key regulators macrophage activation
finally analysis identified potential transcriptional regulator tgif1 was not previously known play role macrophage activation
targeted experimental validation inferred network two transcriptional regulators p50 irf1 were assayed binding cis-regulatory elements lps-stimulated macrophages using chip-on-chip were confirmed bind promoters genes four out five predicted target clusters at significantly higher proportions than expected random set tlr-responsive genes
