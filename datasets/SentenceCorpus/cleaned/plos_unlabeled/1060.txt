 introduction 
modelling neural processing pitch essential understanding perceptual phenomenology music speech
pitch one most important features auditory perception usually associated periodicities sounds
hence number models pitch perception based upon temporal analysis neural activity evoked stimulus
most models compute form short-term autocorrelation simulated auditory nerve activity using exponentially weighted integration time window
autocorrelation models been able predict reported pitches wide range complex stimuli
however choosing appropriate integration time window been problematic none previous models been able explain wide range time scales encountered perceptual data unified fashion
data show certain conditions auditory system capable integrating pitch-related information over time scales several hundred milliseconds while at same time being able follow changes pitch pitch strength resolution only few milliseconds
limits temporal resolution pitch perception also been explored determining pitch detection discrimination performance function frequency modulation rate main conclusion being auditory system limited ability process rapid variations pitch
trade-off between temporal integration resolution not exclusive pitch perception but general characteristic auditory temporal processing
instance long integration time several hundred milliseconds required explain way detectability perceived loudness sounds increases increasing sound duration
contrast much shorter integration times necessary explain fact auditory system resolve sound events separated only few milliseconds
therefore appears integration time auditory processing varies stimulus task
previously was proposed integration resolution reflect processing separate parallel streams different stimulus-independent integration times
more recently order reconcile perceptual data pertaining temporal integration resolution tasks was suggested auditory system makes its decisions based multiple looks at stimulus using relatively short time windows
however our knowledge no model yet quantitatively explained stimulus task-dependency integration time constants
another major challenge pitch modelling relate perceptual phenomena neurophysiological data
functional brain-imaging studies strongly suggest pitch processed hierarchical manner starting sub-cortical structures continuing up through heschl's gyrus planum polare planum temporale
within processing hierarchy there increasing dispersion response latency lower pitches eliciting longer response latencies than higher pitches
suggests time window over auditory system integrates pitch-related information depends pitch itself
however no attempt yet been made explain latency dispersion
study present unified account multiple time scales involved pitch processing
suggest top-down modulation within hierarchical processing structure important explaining stimulus-dependency effective integration time extracting pitch information
highly idealized model formulated terms interacting neural ensembles presented
model represents natural extension previous autocorrelation models pitch form resembling hierarchical generative process higher levels modulate responses lower levels via feedback connections
without modification model account not only wide range perceptual data but also novel neurophysiological data pitch processing
