two lines evidence supported our conclusion model lhd incidence rate may very well better description seasonal epidemic processes studied here
first our model was repeatedly selected best according two different information criteria two different likelihood formulations
second line evidence qualitative nature: contrary what sirs model classical incidence rate predicts solution deterministic sirs model lhd incidence rate will reach either disease free equilibrium endemic equilibrium depending initial conditions
findings along computer intensive simulations models' poincar map environmental stochasticity contributed attain clear separation roles environmental forcing mechanics disease transmission shaping seasonal epidemics dynamics
 introduction 
plethora deterministic epidemic models involving susceptible formula infected formula recovered formula individuals been proposed carefully analyzed confronted data sets biomathematics ecology literatures
well defined topic within mathematical ecology research area study formula-type models seasonal forcing
models proved useful understanding observed patterns natural processes behind human non-human epidemics
here restrict our attention formula formula models introduce seasonal forcing while varying structural form incidence rates
two hypotheses pertaining rsv measles transmission mechanisms were modeled two simple functional forms incidence rates
show doing so able attain clear separation roles environmental forcing mechanics disease transmission shaping epidemics dynamics
construction deterministic incidence rates functions critical building block epidemiological modeling
seminal paper hethcote showed because there many choices form incidence demographic structure epidemiological-demographic interactions there really plethora incidence rate functional forms choose
not surprisingly biomathematics literature abound qualitative mathematical analyses many functional forms
however biological first principles derivations incidence rate functional forms not too common
show study using first principles derivations greatly enrich reaches practice confronting models data while testing biological hypotheses
thus despite big amount available functional incidence rates forms believe set models chosen confronted data should restricted those forms derivable first principles
illustrate argument study first show simple probabilistic setting wherein infectious encounters modeled pure birth stochastic process leads general nonlinear incidence form proposed previously liu later analyzed hethcote van den driessche
lhd incidence rate leads models qualitatively different dynamics compared ones obtained using classical incidence rate
sirs model either incidence rate seasonal forcing formula becomes periodic function time trajectory formula pursuits moving target thus giving rise limit cycles
moving target former endemic equilibrium bounces back forth between two points
either model target switches between moving point disease free equilibrium when formula crosses 1 giving rise period doubling bifurcation
sirs model classical incidence rate mechanism does not depend initial conditions
work show disease free equilibrium unconditionally attractor sirs model lhd incidence rate
leads scenario where two regions attraction coexist
trajectory formula will either reach disease free equilibrium periodic solutions depending initial conditions
furthermore after carrying formal model selection show sirs model lhd incidence rate leads significant fit improvement over classical sirs model same seasonal forcing
finally compared applicability generality classical lhd incidence rates functions fitting them two measles time series data sets
using later function leads vast improvement model fit both cases
since were fitting deterministic seir model chose use data two largest cities measles data set where effects demographic stochasticity expected less influential dynamics epidemics 
varying form contact rate function while including environmental stochasticity sirs seir models leads better understanding dynamics infectious disease transmission
depending model contact rate disease free equilibrium either saddle point attractor
first case if trajectory located originally basin attraction endemic equilibrium basin attraction perturbed environmental noise may transiently visit dfe stable submanifold then return ee basin attraction
if however dfe ee coexist stable equilibria trajectory initially at ee basin attraction may end up dfe basin attraction
interaction between stochasticity different contact rate models was studied using computer intensive simulations poincar map
