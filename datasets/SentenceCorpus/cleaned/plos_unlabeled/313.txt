while many manually curated databases attempt index point mutations most experimentally generated point mutations biological impacts changes described peer-reviewed published literature
describe application mutation grab identifies extracts verifies point mutations biomedical literature
principal problem point mutation extraction link point mutation its associated protein organism origin
our algorithm uses graph-based bigram traversal identify relevant associations exploits swiss-prot protein database verify information
graph bigram method different other models point mutation extraction incorporates frequency positional data all terms article drive point mutation protein association
our method was tested 589 articles describing point mutations g protein coupled receptor tyrosine kinase ion channel protein families
evaluated our graph bigram metric against word-proximity metric term association datasets full-text literature three different protein families
our testing shows graph bigram metric achieves higher f-measure gpcrs protein tyrosine kinases ion channel transporters
importantly situations where more than one protein assigned point mutation disambiguation required graph bigram metric achieves precision 0.84 compared word distance metric precision 0.73
believe graph bigram search metric significant improvement over previous search metrics point mutation extraction applicable text-mining application requiring association words
 introduction 
advent ultra high throughput screening high-density array technology biological community come appreciate value unbiased surveys complex biological systems
bioinformatics tools become integral part analysis extensive datasets
when complex data collected centrally analysis straightforward
when data collected distributed fashion investigators must agree centralized data-deposition strategy must develop tools interrogate published literature extract relevant information
manually curated online databases developed meet need but they difficult maintain scale
accordingly biological text-mining field evolved identify extract information literature database storage access
two types tasks predominate biological text mining: extraction gene protein names extraction interactions between proteins
biocreative challenge was focused name extraction additional task functional annotation
other text-mining applications focus hypothesis generation probing protein subcellular localization pathway discovery 
recent work also focused extraction protein point mutations biomedical literature
protein point mutations substitution wild-type amino acid alternate one important our understanding protein function evolutionary relationships genetic disorders
functional perspective researchers introduce point mutations into proteins assay importance particular residue protein function
evolution relies upon mutations polymorphisms dna mechanism creating diversity protein sequences
while term mutation used imply deleterious changes polymorphism means difference within species text-mining purposes refer point mutation substitution different amino acid reference amino acid
dbsnp human gene mutation database two many databases catalog point mutations their downstream effects
databases manually curated limits speed input into database breadth information represented but does aid incorporation complex information difficult text-mining tools parse
task point mutation extraction decomposed into two subtasks
first necessary identify protein mutation terms discussed within article
after entities identified association must made between point mutation its correct protein origin
problem trivial when paper discusses single protein but increasingly complex when multiple proteins present
our evaluation mutation graph bigram downloaded 589 full-text pdf articles related gpcr tyrosine kinase ion channel protein families pubmed-provided links
using our dictionary-based protein term identification method counted 350 articles out total 589 contained point mutation could belonged multiple proteins
few methods point mutation extraction been developed
rebholz-schuhmann et al describe method called mema scans medline abstracts mutations
baker witte describe method called mutation miner integrates point mutation extraction into protein structure visualization application
our own group presented mutext point mutation extraction method applied g protein coupled receptor nuclear hormone receptor literature
mema mutext use straightforward dictionary search identify protein/gene names word proximity distance measurement disambiguate between multiple protein terms
both methods while providing simple successful method point mutation extraction were limited two areas
first word distance measurement not always correct disambiguating between protein terms
second mema was evaluated set abstracts intrinsically more limited than full-text article
our literature set abstracts contained only 15 percent point mutations found full text
point mutations were also validated against omim only contains disease-related point mutations
mutext was trained evaluated gpcr intranuclear hormone receptor literature contained customizations algorithm dealing problematic protein naming amino acid numbering cases
mutation miner approaches problem differently
method identifies relates proteins organisms point mutations using nlp analysis at sentence level
entity pair assigned if both entities match noun phrase patterns
method would work well if all point mutations were described conjunction associated proteins organisms at sentence level observed not always case
mutation miner also incorporates protein sequence information but use annotating protein 3-d structures mutation information instead point mutation validation
our method improves mema mutext mutation miner using novel graph bigram metric incorporates frequency location terms disambiguate between proteins searches full-text information
like mutext mutation grab utilizes swiss-prot protein database sequence validation intrinsically contains more sequence variation than omim
addressed utility our application standardizing algorithm all protein families evaluating our method three different protein family literature sets covering 589 articles
more detailed comparisons mema mutation miner described discussion section
our task associating point mutations protein terms not sufficient minimally tag protein name literature; must also find its correct gene identifier corresponding database
biocreative challenge addressed problem 1b subtask identifying protein/gene mentioned text annotating its correct gene identifier
solutions challenge ranged rule-based methods machine-learning approaches combination both
unfortunately some methods may not applicable our point mutation extraction task
participants biocreative challenge were provided large set annotated sentences categorized under three different organisms; human yeast fly
some solutions subtask 1b consisted learning training data each organism then applying learned functions test set also divided organism
approach suboptimal our task two reasons
first because point mutations frequently analyzed at protein family superfamily level methods trained protein names organism-specific lexicons would not well-suited analysis across many species
second our goal create broadly applicable methodology point mutation extraction utilized any categorization proteins
machine-learning approaches benefit large detailed annotated training sets
our experience manual labor involved annotating amount text necessary learn protein family specific nomenclature scale presented biocreative likely undermine benefits automated point mutation extraction
methods relying solely rule-based features protein-name identification generally perform at lower precision recall than methods incorporating machine learning
however since rule-based methods do not necessarily require annotated training data they advantageous when data unavailable difficult acquire
our approach protein term identification similar other rule-based approaches
first create dictionary using names synonyms proteins protein family; protein names retrieved their respective swiss-prot entrezgene entries
terms dictionary then searched journal literature
depending character length composition terms search different regular expressions varying levels specificity
