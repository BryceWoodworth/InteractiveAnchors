 
network analysis transcends conventional pairwise approaches data analysis context components network graph taken into account
approaches increasingly being applied genomics data where functional linkages used connect genes proteins
however while microarray gene expression datasets now abundant high quality few approaches been developed analysis data network context

 introduction 
complete genome sequencing hundreds pathogenic model organisms provided parts list required large-scale studies gene function
enormous amounts data pertaining nature genes proteins their interactions cell now been generated techniques including but not limited to: gene coexpression analysis yeast two-hybrid assays mass spectrometry rna interference
functional genomics proteomics approaches when combined computational biology emerging discipline systems biology finally allow us begin comprehensive mapping cellular molecular networks pathways
one main difficulties currently face how best integrate disparate data sources use them better understand biological systems health disease 
visualisation analysis biological data networks becoming increasingly important approach explore wide variety biological relationships
approaches already been used successfully study sequence similarity protein structure protein interactions evolution
shifting biological data into graph/network paradigm allows one use algorithms techniques ideas statistics previously developed graph theory engineering computer science computational systems biology
classical graph theory graph network consists nodes connected edges
biological networks nodes usually genes transcripts proteins while edges tend represent experimentally determined similarities functional linkages between them 
conventional analysis techniques generally pairwise where individual relationship between two biological entities studied without considering higher-order interactions their neighbours
graph network analysis techniques allow exploration position biological entity context its local neighbourhood graph network whole
another important advantage techniques noisy datasets spurious edges tend not form structure resultant graph but instead randomly link nodes; although may not case data generated techniques inherent technical biases
because many network analysis techniques exploit local structure networks between biologically related nodes they far less troubled inherent noise may confound conventional pairwise approaches 
one example network analysis clustering protein protein similarity interaction networks
techniques illustrate graph clustering performs extremely well allows discovery novel aspects biological function
techniques hence provide insight into both local features networks also global features network 
although network analysis biological data shown great promise little attention been paid microarray gene expression data
data now abundant generally high quality consist type high-dimensional data approaches well-suited
principle transformation gene expression data into network graph holds few challenges
similarity between individual expression profiles may determined one number possible statistical techniques e.g pearson spearman correlation coefficients
networks constructed connecting transcripts edges infer varying degrees coexpression based arbitrary correlation threshold
indeed number groups previously sought apply network paradigm microarray data establishing relationships between genes based correlation expression
while studies suggested power approach limitations functionality visualisation capabilities tools supporting their attempts severely limited their approaches general application

specifically chose analyse genomics institute novartis research foundation mouse tissue gene expression atlas demonstrate efficacy approach
gnf data was generated so provide genome-wide analysis transcript abundance across wide range normal tissue cell types
dataset represents one most complete systematic studies tissue-specific expression mammalian transcriptome date
however common other large datasets analysis data presents significant challenges
certain genes known only expressed single cell type at specific times during development response explicit stimuli
others thought expressed all cells simultaneously at about same level
between two extremes there many other genes expressed most number cell types but whose transcription may regulated give specific temporal spatial pattern expression
also known genes play distinct roles common pathway biological process often expressed similar manner; i.e they coexpressed
hence when genes found analogous expression profiles may indicate genes linked functional activities
better understand aspects gene regulation functional role encoded proteins chose explore utility network analysis explore innate structure dataset
demonstrate approach accurately locate clusters genes sharing similar network connectivity relationships between clusters statistical analysis functional annotations
