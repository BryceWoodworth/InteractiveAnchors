 
differentiation embryonic stem cells initiated gradual loss pluripotency-associated transcripts induction differentiation genes
accordingly detection differentially expressed genes at early stages differentiation could assist identification causal genes either promote inhibit differentiation
previous methods identifying differentially expressed genes comparing different cell types would inevitably include large portion genes respond rather than regulate differentiation process
demonstrate through use biological replicates novel statistical approach gene expression data obtained without prior separation cell types informative detecting differentially expressed genes at early stages differentiation
applying proposed method analyze differentiation murine embryonic stem cells identified then experimentally verified smarcad1 novel regulator pluripotency self-renewal
formalized statistical approach statistical test generally applicable analyze other differentiation processes
 introduction 
cellular differentiation process less specialized cell becomes more specialized cell type characterized expression pattern subset genes during differentiation process
search marker genes widely pursued almost every differentiation process although principled approach still missing
current practice separate distinguishable cell types measure gene expression each cell type then identify differentially expressed genes
methods require expression data both cell types available
limitation methods time cell types distinguishable example morphology many genes already shown differential expression
set differentially expressed genes may include class early marker genes enriched markers early differentiating cell lineages well genes whose down-regulation triggers differentiation
however set differentially expressed genes will also include second larger class genes gene expression not important regulation differentiation process but genes simply characteristic fully differentiated cell types
traditional sample comparison procedures not designed separate two classes differentially expressed genes result large lists differentially expressed genes usually do not provide direct guidance dissecting underlining mechanisms differentiation
recognizing early marker genes enables separation cell types at early stage differentiation; turn separating cell types at early stage differentiation enables identification early marker genes
however neither piece puzzle currently available study new differentiation process
demonstrate contrary common belief early marker genes detected measuring average expression mixture cell types provided enough biological replicates been measured statistical test based variance ratio been used
provide theoretical reasoning statistical method two validation experiments
