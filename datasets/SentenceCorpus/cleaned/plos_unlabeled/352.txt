 introduction 
recent discoveries novel noncoding rnas micrornas riboswitches suggest ncrnas important diverse functional regulatory roles impact gene transcription translation localization replication degradation
last few years several groups performed genome-scale computational ncrna predictions based comparative genomic analysis
particular barrick et al used pairwise blast-based approach discover novel riboswitch candidates bacterial genomes many now been experimentally verified
similar studies been conducted various bacterial groups
more recent work extended searches eukaryotes discovering large number known micrornas while producing thousands novel ncrna candidates
some exceptions approaches follow similar paradigm search conserved secondary structures multiple-sequence alignments constructed based sequence similarity alone
typically schemes use measures mutual information between pairs alignment columns signal base-paired regions
however signals methods seek namely compensatory base-pair mutations exactly signals may cause sequence-based alignment methods misalign alternatively refuse align homologous ncrna sequences
even local misalignments may weaken key structural signal making methods sensitive alignment quality especially problematic diverged sequences
paper present novel structure-oriented computational pipeline genome-scale prediction cis-regulatory ncrnas
exploits but does not require sequence conservation
pipeline differs previous methods three respects
first searches unaligned upstream sequences homologous genes instead well-aligned regions constructed sequence-based methods
second predict rna motifs unaligned sequences using tool called cmfinder very sensitive rna motifs low sequence conservation robust inclusion long flanking regions unrelated sequences
finally integrate rna motif prediction rna homology search
every predicted motif scan genome database more homologs then used refine model
iterative process improves model expands motif families automatically
study apply pipeline discover ncrna elements prokaryotes
chose prokaryotes mainly because large number fully sequenced genomes great sequence divergence among species well-exploited our approach
our approach two key advantages
first efficient highly automated
earlier steps more computationally efficient than later steps apply filters between steps so poor candidates eliminated subsequent analysis
thus even though use some computationally expensive algorithms pipeline scalable larger problems
besides providing rna motif prediction pipeline also integrates gene context functional analysis facilitates manual biological evaluation
second pipeline highly accurate finding prokaryotic ncrnas especially rna cis-regulatory elements
demonstrate performance approach report our search results firmicutes gram-positive bacterial division includes bacillus subtilis relatively well-studied model organism many known ncrnas
method exhibits low false-positive rates negative controls low false-negative rates known firmicute ncrnas
rna family database partially hand-curated database noncoding rnas includes 13 ncrna families categorized cis-regulatory elements representatives b subtilis
11 included among our top 50 predictions 12th appears somewhat lower our ranking
two other rfam families also represented among our top 50 predictions
addition both secondary structure prediction identified family members excellent agreement rfam annotation
14 rfam families mentioned above achieved 91 percent specificity 84 percent sensitivity average identifying family members 77 percent specificity 75 percent sensitivity secondary structure prediction
many promising novel ncrna candidates were also discovered discussed below
