 
large-scale protein interaction networks typically been discerned using affinity purification followed mass spectrometry yeast two-hybrid techniques
generally recognized y2h screens detect direct binary interactions while ap/ms method captures co-complex associations; however latter technique known yield prevalent false positives arising number effects including abundance
describe novel approach compute propensity two proteins co-purify ap/ms data set thereby allowing us assess detected level interaction specificity analyzing corresponding distribution interaction scores
find two recent ap/ms data sets yeast contain enrichments specific high-scoring associations compared commensurate random profiles curated direct physical interactions two prominent data bases consistently high scores
our scored interaction data sets generally more comprehensive than those previous studies when compared against four diverse high-quality reference sets
furthermore find our scored data sets more enriched curated direct physical associations than y2h sets
high-confidence protein interaction network derived ap/ms data revealed highly modular show topology not result misrepresenting indirect associations direct interactions
fact propose modularity y2h data sets may underrepresented they contain indirect associations significantly enriched false negatives
ap/ms pin also found contain significant assortative mixing; however line previous study confirm y2h interaction data show weak disassortativeness thus revealing more clearly distinctive natures interaction detection methods
expect our scored yeast data sets ideal further biological discovery our scoring system will prove useful other ap/ms data sets
 introduction 
insights into architectures mechanisms cellular processes obtained elucidation genome-wide protein interaction networks describe physical associations between component proteins
maps interactomes exploited enhance many types biological discovery including protein function prediction inference disease genes identification condition-specific response modules
yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae been routinely employed model system high-throughput studies pins been determined using number platforms including yeast two-hybrid screens affinity purification followed mass spectrometry protein-fragment complementation assays
each approach perceives interactions distinct manner
y2h pca techniques detect direct binary interactions although pca approach does not rely upon expression reporter gene required y2h screens while ap/ms techniques purify identify protein complexes
reliability each technique been extensively debated literature comprehensive analyses resulted contrasting conclusions
however generally accepted any measure reliability not absolute largely dependent nature pre-defined gold standard reference set
additional complexity arises analysis interpretation ap/ms data set because there no standard well-defined system distinguish between direct indirect interactions present purified complex
only information available individual purification its composition: tagged bait protein associated co-purified prey proteins
furthermore constituent proteins identified complex ms methods different platforms often yield varying compositions identical purifications
another concern compositions purifications influenced protein abundances  proteins having higher abundance more likely detected more purifications therefore inferred involved more interactions after tabulation all bait-prey pairs
address issues number approaches analysis ap/ms data sets been employed
techniques common goal discerning protein pairs appreciably co-purified relative some random background
while each method determines scores representing likelihood observing two proteins together scores computed using different procedures: gavin et al calculate log-ratios observed co-occurrences relative expected ; krogan et al utilize combination machine learning algorithms ; collins et al implement supervised algorithm derived bayesian methods optimized empirically-derived parameters ; hart et al determine interaction probabilities based hypergeometric distributions
qualities generated pins been found superior comparable data sets constructed straightforward tabulations bait-prey interactions
evaluations were generally deduced direct comparisons against complexes manually curated munich information center protein sequences 
recent study high-throughput y2h data sets explored characteristic strengths distributions functional interactions non-functional interactions order assess extent latter impedes formation functional protein complexes
was conjectured overall impact upon biochemical efficiencies had evolved tolerable limit
motivated use randomization techniques tool measure discover enrichments network motifs connectivity correlations complex networks developed shuffling-based approach assess levels interaction specificity detected ap/ms data sets
system allows computation pair-wise protein co-occurrence significance scores comparing experimentally observed numbers those randomized realizations
cs score two proteins provides statistical measure their propensity co-purify interact ap/ms data set
approach requires no training set machine learning therefore applicable any ap/ms data set any species regardless whether any curated information exists not
found ap/ms data sets contain significant enrichments specific high-scoring associations
additionally showed high-quality direct physical interactions curated two prominent data bases significantly high cs scores
therefore while ap/ms data sets contain prevalent non-specific transient associations our scoring analysis reveals there underlying preference proteins form selective discriminating associations
our resultant scored interaction data sets were further assessed comparisons against four diverse high-quality reference data sets each representing unique manner interaction detection association mechanism and/or curation
most references found accuracies our scored interaction sets were manifestly higher than those previous studies
additionally our scored data sets only ones typically outperformed experimental y2h interaction sets
high-confidence pin extracted ap/ms data gavin et al was revealed free abundance effects while those derived data krogan et al contained weak abundance biases
therefore would appear high-quality ap/ms data sets interaction specificity not coupled protein abundance
note converse recently been found true y2h interaction data sets 
high-confidence pin derived data gavin et al was shown highly modular containing many localized densely-connected regions strikingly different commensurate random network
also demonstrated observed high modularity not result misinterpreting indirect associations direct interactions; rather result direct physical associations
furthermore suggest modularity y2h interaction data sets may underrepresented indirect associations pins significantly enriched manually-curated physical interactions i.e they likely false negatives
high-confidence ap/ms pin shows assortative mixing meaning proteins having similar numbers total interactions prefer interact each other
consequence assortativity high-degree proteins hubs prefer associate each other rather than proteins having very small numbers total interactions
agreement previous study find consolidated y2h pin shows weak disassortative mixing while manually-curated set high-confidence physical binary interactions displays both equal measure assortative disassortative mixing
therefore high-quality ap/ms data appear assortative while y2h interaction data appear disassortative
expect our scored yeast data sets ideal further investigations involving biological discovery our procedure will prove useful analysis current future ap/ms data sets variety species
compared our high-quality ap/ms interaction data sets those y2h screens perceived number novel insights regarding their substances network properties
certainly their topologies contrasting must reflect their different methods interaction detection
