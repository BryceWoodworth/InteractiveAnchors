 introduction 
modern concept allostery began models monod et al koshland et al sought account allostery based upon gross properties transition between two well-defined end-states
more recent thermodynamic models allostery characterize population shifts conformational ensembles more detail there experimental evidence alternate allosteric states simultaneously populated solution
nonetheless mechanical chemical transitions individual molecules underlie thermodynamic properties allosteric proteins
individual molecules energetic pathways spatially contiguous physically coupled structural changes and/or dynamic fluctuations must link substrate effector sites 
crystal structures revealed most allosteric proteins complex systems both tertiary quaternary structural changes
previously quantified allosteric communication through tertiary structure graphs residue-residue contacts form break rearrange transition between inactive active state structures
network representations protein structure putative paths between residues distant three-dimensional space readily identified
tertiary networks contact rearrangement networks identified substrate-effector paths 6 15 proteins tested indicated tertiary changes play significant but incomplete role allosteric communication
work broaden crn approach toward more completely quantifying allosteric coupling mechanisms structure
specifically develop network representation quaternary structural changes integrate representation crn
seek infer information about allosteric coupling mechanism gross properties differences between inactive active structures
our work resembles mwc knf approaches but differs investigations kinetic mechanism order events transition between inactive active structural regimes
most current computational approaches large-scale protein dynamics predict motions and/or associated energetics applying structure theoretical models like elastic network potential functions
while predictions address important problems most approaches do not predict allosteric pathways
contrast problems will argue allosteric pathway identification facilitated network representation protein structural transition
network representations protein structures previously been used illuminate dynamic and/or allosteric properties
example large-scale fluctuations predicted normal mode analysis elastic network correlate known conformational changes
addition rigid flexible regions protein structures been predicted network contact hydrogen bond constraints single protein structure
furthermore residues important maintaining short paths contact network experimentally known mediate signaling proteins
however allosteric communication pathways not previously been derived network representation quaternary structural transition
paper develop hypothesis allosteric coupling via networks quaternary motions
elucidate rigid bodies differences between inactive active crystal structures automatic algorithm form quaternary network rigid bodies based contacts between them
toward broader representation allosteric communication mechanisms assess how communication through networks relates through contact rearrangement networks tertiary structure
then integrate quaternary networks coarse-grained representation crns form global communication networks
describe range topologies gcns several representative proteins allosteric benchmark set then assess substrate-effector communication via crns quaternary network gcn 18 dna-binding proteins enzymes classify each protein based respective tertiary quaternary contributions connectivity
gcn analysis provides opportunity advance theory mechanical allosteric coupling proteins may guide drug design allosteric experiments simulations
