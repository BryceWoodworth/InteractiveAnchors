because sequences embedded background genomic dna hard identify key cis-regulatory elements determine disparate patterns gene expression
detection intra inter-species differences among sequences crucial understanding molecular basis both differential gene expression evolution
here address problem investigating target promoters controlled dna-binding phop protein governs virulence mg 2 homeostasis several bacterial species
phop particularly interesting; highly conserved different gamma/enterobacteria regulating not only ancestral genes but also governing expression dozens horizontally acquired genes differ species species
our approach consists decomposing dna binding site sequences given regulator into families motifs using machine learning method inspired divide conquer strategy
partitioning motif into sub-patterns computational advantages classification were produced resulting discovery new members regulon alleviating problem distinguishing functional sites chromatin immunoprecipitation dna microarray genome-wide analysis
moreover found certain partitions were useful revealing biological properties binding site sequences including modular gains losses phop binding sites through evolutionary turnover events well conservation distant species
high conservation phop submotifs within gamma/enterobacteria well regulatory protein recognizes them suggests major cause divergence between related species not due binding sites was previously suggested other regulators
instead divergence may attributed fast evolution orthologous target genes and/or promoter architectures resulting interaction those binding sites rna polymerase
 introduction 
whole genome sequences well microarray chromatin inmunoprecipitation array hybridization data provide raw material characterization understanding underlying regulatory systems
still challenging however discern sequence elements relevant differential gene expression those corresponding binding sites transcriptional factors rna polymerase when they embedded background genomic dna sequences do not play role gene expression
raises question: how does single regulator distinguish promoter sequences when affinity major determinant differential expression
also how does regulator evolve given there appears non-monotonic co-evolution regulators targets 
methods look matching consensus pattern been successfully used identify bss promoters controlled particular tfs
tools motif discovery designed find unknown relatively short sequence patterns located primarily promoter regions genomes
because searches performed context short signals embedded high statistical noise current tools tend discard relevant number samples only weakly resemble consensus
moreover strict cutoffs used methods while increasing specificity display lower sensitivity weak but still functional bss
because consensus motif reflects single pattern derived averaging dna sequences often conceals sub-patterns might define distinct regulatory mechanisms
overall use consensuses tends homogenize sequence motifs among promoters even across species hampers discovery key features distinguish co-regulated promoters within across species
circumvent limitations consensus methods decomposed bs motifs into sub-patterns applying classical divide conquer strategy
then compared different forms decomposed bs motifs tf into families motifs computational clustering perspective
so doing extracted maximal amount useful genomic information through effective handling biological experimental variability inherent data then combined them into accurate multi-classifier predictor
although there computational usefulness submotifs was not clear if families motifs were just computational artifact if they could provide insights into regulatory process carried out regulator its targets
address problem evaluated ability submotifs characterize gene expression both within across genomes
first used submotifs distinguish between functional non-functional bss genome-wide searches using combination chip-chip custom expression microarray experiments
then determined evolutionary significance submotifs calculating their rate evolution mapping gain loss events along phylogenetic tree gamma/enterobacteria
interspecies variation orthologous genes conservation regulatory protein well cis-features conforming promoter architecture allowed us evaluate major causes divergences between species 
applied our approach analyze genes regulated phop/phoq two-component system mediates adaptation low mg 2 environments and/or virulence several bacteria species including escherichia coli species salmonella species shigella species erwinia species photorhabdus yersinia species
two-component systems represent primary signal transduction paradigm prokaryotic organisms
although proteins encoded systems often well conserved throughout different bacterial species regulators like phop differentially control expression many horizontally-acquired genes constitute one major sources genomic variation
