 
metagenomics discipline enables genomic study uncultured microorganisms
faster cheaper sequencing technologies ability sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly their habitats expanding transforming our view microbial world
distilling meaningful information millions new genomic sequences presents serious challenge bioinformaticians
cultured microbes genomic data come single clone making sequence assembly annotation tractable
metagenomics data come heterogeneous microbial communities sometimes containing more than 10,000 species sequence data being noisy partial
sampling assembly gene calling function prediction bioinformatics faces new demands interpreting voluminous noisy often partial sequence data
although metagenomics relative newcomer science past few years seen explosion computational methods applied metagenomic-based research
therefore not within scope article provide exhaustive review
rather provide here concise yet comprehensive introduction current computational requirements presented metagenomics review recent progress made
also note whether there software implements any methods presented here briefly review its utility
nevertheless would useful if readers article would avail themselves comment section provided journal relate their own experiences
finally last section article provides few representative studies illustrating different facets recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics
 introduction 
most its history life earth consisted solely microscopic life forms microbial life still dominates earth many aspects
estimated 5 10 30 prokaryotic cells inhabiting our planet sequester some 350 550 petagrams carbon 85 130 pg nitrogen 9 14 pg phosphorous making them largest reservoir those nutrients earth
bacteria archaea live all environments capable sustaining other life many cases sole inhabitants extreme environments: deep sea vents temperatures 340 c rocks found boreholes 6 km beneath earth's surface
bacteria archea microeukaryotes dominate earth's habitats compound recycling nutrient sequestration according some estimates biomass
microbes not only ubiquitous they essential all life they primary source nutrients primary recyclers dead matter back available organic form
along all other animals plants human condition profoundly affected microbes scourges human farm animal crop pandemics benefits agriculture food industry medicine name few
humans more bacterial cells inhabiting our body than our own cells
been stated key understanding human condition lies understanding human genome
but given our intimate relationship microbes researching human genome now understood necessary though insufficient condition: sequencing genomes our own microbes would necessary too
also better understand role microbes biosphere would necessary undertake genomic study them well
study microbial genomes started late 1970s sequencing genomes bacteriophages ms2 x174
1995 microbiology took major step sequencing first bacterial genome haemophilus influenza
genomes 916 bacterial 1,987 viral 67 archaeal species deposited genbank release 2.2.6
having hand large number microbial genomes changed nature microbiology microbial evolution studies
providing ability examine relationship genome structure function across many different species data also opened up fields comparative genomics systems biology
nevertheless single organism genome studies limits
first technology limitations mean organism must first clonally cultured sequence its entire genome
however only small percentage microbes nature cultured means extant genomic data highly biased do not represent true picture genomes microbial species
second very rarely do microbes live single species communities: species interact both each other their habitats may also include host organisms
therefore clonal culture also fails represent true state affairs nature respect organism interaction resulting population genomic variance biological functions
new sequencing technologies drastic reduction cost sequencing helping us overcome limits
now ability obtain genomic information directly microbial communities their natural habitats
suddenly instead looking at few species individually able study tens thousands all together
sequence data taken directly environment were dubbed metagenome study sequence data directly environment metagenomics 
however environmental sequencing comes its own information-restricting price tag
single organism genomics practically all microbe's genome sequenced providing complete picture genome
know species dna rna originated
after assembly location genes operons transcriptional units computationally inferred
control elements other cues identified infer transcriptional translational units
consequently achieve nearly complete well-ordered picture all genomic elements sequenced organism
may not recognize all elements what they some errors may creep but gauge breadth our knowledge properly annotate those areas genome manage decipher
contrast sequences obtained environmental genomic studies fragmented
each fragment was obviously sequenced specific species but there many different species single sample most full genome not available
many cases impossible determine true species origin
length each fragment anywhere between 20 base pairs 700 bp depending sequencing method used
short sequence reads dissociated their original species assembled lengths usually not exceeding 5,000 bp; consequently reconstruction whole genome generally not possible
even reconstruction entire transcriptional unit problematic
addition being fragmented incomplete volume sequence data acquired environmental sequencing several orders magnitude larger than acquired single organism genomics
reasons computational biologists been developing new algorithms analyze metagenomic data
computational challenges new very exciting
entering era akin first genomic revolution almost two decades ago
whole organism genomics allows us examine evolution not only single genes but whole transcriptional units chromosomes cellular networks
but more recently metagenomics gave us ability study most fundamental genomic level relationship between microbes communities habitats they live
how does adaptation microbes different environments including host animals other microbes manifest itself their genomes
us humans question strike very close home when those habitats our own bodies microbes associated our own well-being illnesses: almost every aspect human life well life every other living being planet affected microbes
now experimental technology understand microbial communities how they affect us but sheer volume fragmentary nature data challenge computational biologists distill all data into useful information
article shall briefly outline some experimental technological computational achievements challenges associated metagenomic data sequence generation assembly through various levels metagenomic annotation
will also discuss computational issues unique environmental genomics estimating metagenome size handling associated metadata
finally will review some studies highlighting advantages metagenomic-based research some insights enabled
