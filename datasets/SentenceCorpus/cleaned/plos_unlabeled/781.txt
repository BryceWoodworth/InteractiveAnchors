fruit fly drosophila melanogaster classic example sharp off activation hunchback gene at midembryo response local concentrations smooth anterior posterior bicoid gradient
regulatory region hb contains multiple binding sites bcd protein well multiple binding sites hb protein
some previous studies suggested bcd sufficient properly sharpened hb expression yet other evidence suggests need additional regulation
experimentally quantified dynamics hb gene expression flies were wild-type were mutant hb self-regulation bcd binding contained artificial promoter construct consisting six bcd two hb sites
addition experiments developed reaction diffusion model hb transcription bcd cooperative binding hb self-regulation used zero eigenvalue analysis look multiple stationary states reaction network
our model reproduces hb developmental dynamics correctly predicts mutant patterns
analysis our model indicates hb sharpness produced spatial bistability hb self-regulation produces two stable levels expression
absence self-regulation bistable behavior vanishes hb sharpness disrupted
bcd cooperative binding affects position where bistability occurs but not itself sufficient sharp hb pattern
our results show control hb sharpness positioning hb self-regulation bcd cooperativity respectively separate processes altered independently
our model matches changes hb position sharpness observed different experiments provides theoretical framework understanding data particular indicates spatial bistability play central role threshold-dependent reading mechanisms positional information
 introduction 
how embryo achieves pattern form initially undifferentiated state fascinated people at least since time aristotle
scientific advances began over century ago example experiments hans driesch sea urchin embryos he proposed embryo coordinate system specifying cellular position; experiments ethel browne who showed piece hydra mount induced secondary axis when grafted into body another hydra
other subsequent results were synthesized lewis wolpert 1969 into definition positional information
according concept spatial asymmetries concentration gradients chemical signals provide positional information during cellular differentiation; each cell reads its position local morphogen concentration differentiates accordingly
wolpert's concept morphogen gradients become central tenet developmental biology
modern molecular techniques demonstrated numerous cases protein concentration patterns embryogenesis many been shown act morphogens
late 1980's bicoid protein gradient was characterized its concentration-dependent effect downstream target genes drosophila was demonstrated
since become one most studied examples morphogen gradient signaling developmental biology 
reaction-network models been successfully applied describe great variety systems physics chemistry biology
along many mathematical tools been developed support applications
tools one show certain reaction networks may exhibit multiple stationary states particular ranges their rate constants
bistability special case system evolve either two asymptotically stable steady states
under certain conditions spatial patterning oscillations arise
biology bistability long been established control cell cycle other oscillations also recently reported artificial gene regulation network
drosophila spatial bistability been proposed dorso-ventral patterning 
early embryogenesis diffusion bcd protein translated mrna localized at anterior end egg forms exponential concentration gradient establishing anterior posterior axis
bcd transcriptional regulator through its asymmetric distribution acts morphogen governing positions at downstream gap genes will activated
combination cross-regulation between genes initial bcd asymmetry propagated refined establishing first stage embryo segmentation
still not well characterized however what mechanisms interpret smooth bcd positional information into sharp precisely positioned downstream target gene expression
hunchback one first gap genes activated bcd strong anterior expression sharp off boundary at mid-embryo
anterior hb activation depends bcd shown struhl et al driever et al its own self-regulation already reported treisman et al margolis et al ; many bcd hb binding sites been identified hb promoter region reported treisman et al among others
hb maternal zygotic contributions provides positional information other gap genes kr ppel knirps giant homeotic gene ultrabithorax
removal both maternal zygotic hb expression results severe deletions polarity reversals most anterior segments
normal development hb expression drops highest lowest over about 10 percent egg length ; considerable attention been focused what molecular mechanism generates hb sharpness
early was shown hb enhancer element 300 base pairs containing 6 bcd binding sites sufficient reproduce regulatory activity bcd hb
was shown bcd binds sites cooperatively was hypothesized due cooperativity small change bcd concentration across some threshold could produce large change hb promoter occupancy generating off expression pattern
however studies did not establish cooperativity sufficient generate hb border sharpness
quantify degree bcd's cooperativity ma et al used six-bcd site fragment hb promoter dnase i footprint assay found hill coefficient about 3.6; burz et al using gel-shift assay 230 bp hb enhancer found hill coefficient 3.0
quantified vivo patterns bcd hb proteins gregor et al estimated higher value coefficient around 5 ; suggested could support proposal crauk dostatni hb expression entirely determined bcd cooperative binding
however systems high hill coefficients would expected show temperature sensitivity
houchmandzadeh et al showed bcd gradient strongly affected temperature changes 20 c but hb pattern largely unaffected
dependence bcd hill coefficients between 3 5 would expected show far greater effects hb than observed indicating bcd cannot only factor regulating hb border
insufficiency bcd cooperativity produce hb sharpness also supported findings simpson-brose et al who showed synergy between hb bcd necessary establish expression patterns gap genes including hb itself
address issues taken combined experimental theoretical approach understand how hb gene converts positional information smooth bcd gradient into sharp expression pattern
used wild-type embryos experimentally determine how hb position sharpness change time; measured how quantities affected embryos mutant bcd cooperative binding hb self-regulation use artificial promoter 6 bcd 2 hb binding sites
also developed predictive reaction diffusion model hb transcription incorporating both bcd cooperative binding hb self-regulation
fitting model wild-type bcd hb patterns determined kinetic parameters model binding constants
parameters our model successfully reproduces dynamic development hb pattern
reducing bcd binding constants number bcd binding sites our model reproduces same mutant phenotypes our experiments predicts loss sharpness hb self-regulation mutant experimentally verified
applying dynamical systems theory model show hb sharpness due spatial bistability stemming hb self-regulation
means hb does not single steady-state concentration continuously dependent bcd but at threshold bcd concentration two stable steady states become available hb small change bcd concentration create dramatic shift hb concentration
shift between steady states responsible sharpness hb boundary
position bcd threshold controlled bcd cooperative binding but mechanism itself not sufficient generate hb's expression sharpness
