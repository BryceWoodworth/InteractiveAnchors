 
ryanodine receptors ion channels regulate muscle contraction releasing calcium ions intracellular stores into cytoplasm
mutations skeletal muscle ryr give rise congenital diseases central core disease
absence high-resolution structures ryr1 limited our understanding channel function disease mechanisms at molecular level
here report structural model pore-forming region ryr1
molecular dynamics simulations show high ion binding putative pore residues d4899 e4900 d4938 d4945 experimentally known critical channel conductance selectivity
also observe preferential localization ca 2 over k selectivity filter ryr1
simulations ryr1-d4899q mutant show loss preference ca 2 selectivity filter seen experimentally
electrophysiological experiments central core disease mutant ryr1-g4898r show constitutively open channels conduct k but not ca 2
our simulations g4898r likewise show decrease preference ca 2 over k selectivity filter

 introduction 
muscle contraction upon excitation nerve impulse initiated rapid rise cytoplasmic ca 2
skeletal muscle rise cytoplasmic ca 2 brought about opening ryanodine receptor releases ca 2 intracellular stores
ryrs large tetrameric ion channels present membranes endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum
they high conductance monovalent divalent cations while being selective divalent cations
ryrs important mediators excitation-contraction coupling congenital mutations ryrs result neuromuscular diseases malignant hypothermia central core disease 
although ryrs physiologically important molecular basis their function poorly understood
ryrs unique properties their modes selectivity permeation not seen other ion channels known structures
next putative selectivity filter there two negatively charged residues ryr1 essential normal selectivity conductance
k channels analogous selectivity filter but contrast ryr1 only one adjacent negative residue not even conserved while other ca 2 channels only one conserved negative residue equivalent position
selectivity filter mutations result non-functional channels leading ccd
structural model pore region would reveal location function residues will useful understanding role residues channel function
early model ryr ion permeation postulated potential barriers within pore corresponding three putative binding sites
without any knowledge structure pore model was able quantitatively reproduce conductance data various ions
pnp-dft model accurately modeled role residues d4899 e4900 ryr1 generating high ion conductances ryrs established mutagenesis
selectivity was attributed charge-space competition ca 2 could accommodate most charge least space compared k however since channel model used simulations relied fixed structure could not predict changes due mutations potentially alter structure channel
additionally there two homology models ryr pore region based kcsa bacterial k channel whose solution structure known
shah et al used bioinformatics approaches construct models ryr related inositol triphosphate channel
luminal loop their ryr model begins at 4890g resulting selectivity filter being 4890gvragg
however mutagenesis shown residues i4897 g4898 d4899 e4900 important channel conductance selectivity suggests they part conduction pathway ryr1 resulting predicted selectivity filter being 4894gggigde
welch et al also constructed homology model cardiac ryanodine receptor using structure kcsa channel performed simulations identify residues important channel function
their simulations failed identify d4899 important residue ion permeation contrary what been shown experimentally
furthermore cryo-electron microscopy ryr1 revealed significant differences between pore region kcsa ryr1 
experimental structure determinations ryrs been mainly performed cryo-em
studies revealed conformational changes accompany channel opening binding sites various effectors ryrs
cryo-em resolution 10 25 thus able provide only limited structural information regarding pore structure
samso et al manually docked kcsa pore structure into transmembrane region their cryoem map intact closed ryr1
furthermore they predicted presence at least 6 transmembrane helices simple volumetric constraints
ludtke et al identified several secondary structure elements their 10 resolution cryo-em map closed ryr1
pore-forming region visualized ludtke et al consists long inner helix made up 31 residues pore helix made up 15 residues presumably connected long luminal loop made up 24 residues
since structure derived cryo-em positions pore residues' side chains structure loops connecting helices unknown
build molecular model pore region ryr1 based their cryo-em study adding luminal loop missing side chains residues forming helices pore
furthermore our molecular dynamics simulations examine interactions pore region mono divalent cations known permeate channel
