 
perception involves two types decisions about sensory world: identification stimulus features analog quantities discrimination same stimulus features among set discrete alternatives
veridical judgment categorical discrimination traditionally been conceptualized two distinct computational problems
here found two types decision making subserved shared cortical circuit mechanism
used continuous recurrent network model simulate two monkey experiments subjects were required make either two-alternative forced choice veridical judgment about direction random-dot motion
model network endowed continuum bell-shaped population activity patterns each representing possible motion direction
slow recurrent excitation underlies accumulation sensory evidence its interplay strong recurrent inhibition leads decision behaviors
model reproduced monkey's performance well single-neuron activity categorical discrimination task
furthermore examined how direction identification determined combination sensory stimulation microstimulation
using population-vector measure found direction judgments instantiate winner-take-all when two stimuli far apart vector averaging when two stimuli close each other
interestingly broad range intermediate angular distances between two stimuli network displays mixed strategy sense direction estimates stochastically produced winner-take-all some trials vector averaging other trials model prediction experimentally testable
work thus lends support common neurodynamic framework both veridical judgment categorical discrimination perceptual decision making
 introduction 
perceptual judgments involve detection identification discrimination objects sensory scene
given ambiguous visual motion pattern instance subject may asked detect whether net motion direction present absent identify motion direction analog quantity discriminate motion direction between two options
using strategy single-unit recording behaving monkeys neurophysiologists begun uncover neuronal activity linked perceptual judgments
monkey experiments using perceptual discrimination tasks neural correlates decision making been observed parietal premotor prefrontal cortical areas
experimental observations inspired advance neural circuit models suggest recurrent network dynamics underlie temporal integration sensory information decision formation 
focusing categorical discrimination those neural circuit models well ramp-to-threshold models typically endowed simple architecture consisting discrete neural pools selective categorical alternatives
therefore they inadequate exploring perceptual identification requires neural representation analog quantities motion direction arbitrary angle between 0 360
other hand probabilistic estimation analog stimulus feature been studied perspective optimal population coding
studies centered optimal algorithms reading out stimulus feature sensory neural populations inferring orientation visual stimulus neural activity primary visual cortex direction motion stimulus activity profiles across middle temporal visual area
however probabilistic inference believed occur higher-order cortical areas downstream primary sensory areas underlying circuit mechanism remains unclear
particular unknown whether probabilistic estimation categorical discrimination engage distinct decision processes realized shared neural circuit mechanism
present work investigated outstanding question using continuous recurrent network model spiking neurons was initially proposed spatial working memory
applied model simulation two monkey experiments using random-dot visual motion stimuli
two-alternative forced-choice direction discrimination task monkey was trained discriminate motion direction making saccadic eye movement one two peripheral choice targets
was found ramp-like spiking activity neurons lateral intraparietal cortex correlated monkey's choice
contrast direction identification task monkey was required report veridically its perceived direction motion visual stimulus
some trials electrical stimulation was applied simultaneously mt neurons when monkey viewed random-dot display
microstimulation could bias monkey's judgments toward preferred direction mt neurons at microstimulation site
was argued both vector-averaging winner-take-all algorithms might contribute interpretation activity profiles mt neurons
but collected only behavioral data did not record neural activity mt downstream cortical areas
thus neural mechanism veridical judgments about motion direction remains unknown
here show continuous recurrent network model capable reproducing salient observations both experiments
our results suggest both categorical discrimination veridical judgment subserved common cortical circuit endowed reverberatory dynamics
