 introduction 
limited amount time available before nighttime winter retirement need make large number choices maximize our total reward gain
particular when choosing between larger but delayed reward smaller but more immediate reward compare values associated each reward choose reward associated larger value
critical choices shape steepness reward values monotonically decrease function delay: rewards said discounted function delays 
two main classes models characterize shape reward discounting been proposed: exponential hyperbolic
although researchers artificial intelligence favor exponential discounting uncertain environments e.g all behavioral studies directly compared two types discounting animals humans concluded hyperbolic discounting better fits delayed reward choice data than does exponential discounting e.g 
exponential discounting reward value v given by: formulawhere r reward magnitude d delay k 0 decay rate
equation equivalently given by: formulawhere discount factor exp; note here large decay rate corresponds small discount factor vice versa
because constant decay rate exponential discounting rational predicts constant preference
typical human studies questionnaire-based: subjects asked make number choices between small immediate rewards larger rewards weeks months years future after thinking about consequences each alternative
studies hyperbolic discounted reward value given by: formula
animal studies animals trained make repeated reward choices experience both delays rewards
assuming constant inter-trial interval if animal consistently makes choice gives same reward r after same delay d average reward rate hyperbolic function delay : formulawhere t sum all times except delay each trial v reward value
because decreasing decay rate function delay hyperbolic discounting been termed irrational predicts preference reversal impulsive choice
instance individual may prefer one apple today two apples tomorrow but at same time prefer two apples 51 days one apple 50 days
hyperbolic discounting often presented struggle between oneself one's alter ego future similarly between myopic doer farsighted planner see
what situations theoretically advantageous make delayed reward choices based exponential hyperbolic discounting
exponential discounting maximizes total gain situations constant probability reward loss per unit time exact estimate time future reward delivery see
because hyperbolic discounted value given equation 4 reward rate maximizes total gain situations constant delays at each trial 
but does hyperbolic discounting maximize total gain foraging-like situations situations repeated forced choices varying delays rewards constant iti limited total time
situations hyperbolic discounting model maximizes instantaneous reward rate
but trials not independent each other hyperbolic discounting may not maximize average reward rate thus total gain
instance relatively unfavorable trial long delays both rewards although hyperbolic discounting may favor large reward pursuing small more immediate reward may result smaller overall decrease average reward rate
choosing small but less-delayed reward subject quickly move next more favorable trials
thus hypothesize situations discounting strategy values rewards longer delays less than hyperbolic discounting exponential discounting does would maximize total gain
steepness discounting specifies how far future delayed rewards should considered
large decay rate biases individuals acquire small more immediate rewards
individuals impulse-control disorders well heroin alcohol cigarette cocaine-addicted individuals steeper discounting functions than controls
small decay rate promotes acquisition large more delayed rewards
yet individuals must obtain some rewards time; instance animal must find food before starves before exhausted before winter arrives
thus discount rate should carefully adjusted maximize total gain task situations repeated forced choices varying delays rewards limited total time 
here designed task mimics animal foraging study whether humans could adopt discounting function whose shape steepness maximize total gain
at each trial subjects had choose between smaller more immediate reward larger delayed reward varying experienced delays rewards fixed iti
avoid subjects trying compute explicit reward ratios other objective measures reward discounting did not provide direct access delay
instead subjects had select at each trial between one two squares made 100 small patches
stimulus color coded monetary reward amount
at each trial initial number black patches white stimulus indicated small delay d s initial number black patches yellow stimulus indicated large delay d l subject was then prompted choose one two stimuli: stimulus had been selected previous step showed more filled patches other stimulus was identical previous step
stimuli were always displayed one time step
chain events was repeated until either square was completely filled
then display acquired reward was shown during iti 1.5 s 
experiment total time was limited five sessions 210 s each separated 15 s give subject some rest time
thus each subject had 700 steps available maximize total reward
because subjects performed minimum one training session equal duration before experiment they were highly familiar task
subjects were compensated total reward earned at end experiment
