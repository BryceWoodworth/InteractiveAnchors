pcr resequencing method choice de novo snp discovery
however manual curation putative snps been major bottleneck application method high-throughput screening
therefore critical develop more sensitive accurate computational method automated snp detection
developed software tool snpdetector automated identification snps mutations fluorescence-based resequencing reads
snpdetector was designed model process human visual inspection very low false positive false negative rate
demonstrate superior performance snpdetector snp mutation analysis comparing its results those derived human inspection polyphred independent genotype assays three large-scale investigations
first study identified validated inter intra-subspecies variations 4,650 traces 25 inbred mouse strains belong either mus musculus species m spretus species
unexpected heterozgyosity cast/ei strain was observed two out 1,167 mouse snps
second study identified 11,241 candidate snps five encode regions human genome covering 2.5 mb genomic sequence
approximately 50 percent candidate snps were selected experimental genotyping; validation rate exceeded 95 percent
third study detected enu-induced mutations 64,896 traces 1,236 zebra fish
our analysis three large diverse test datasets demonstrated snpdetector effective tool genome-scale research large-sample clinical studies
snpdetector runs unix/linux platform available publicly 
 introduction 
identification genetic variations mutations important discovery genetic predisposition complex diseases
although wide variety methods available de novo single nucleotide polymorphism discovery dna sequencing method choice high-throughput screening studies
dna sequencing may follow either random shotgun strategy directed strategy using pcr amplification specific target regions interest
high-density haplotype map human genome nears completion demand large-scale snp surveys seeking genetic mutations linked causative wide variety human diseases expected greatly increase 
direct sequencing pcr-amplified genomic fragments diploid samples results mixed sequencing templates
therefore one most challenging issues snp discovery method distinguish bona fide heterozygous allelic variations sequencing artifacts give rise two overlapping fluorescence peaks similar true heterozygotes
currently polyphred most widely used snp discovery software analysis
reports heterozygous allele only when site shows decrease about 50 percent peak height compared average height homozygous individuals
however inspection computational results human analysts often required ensure low false positive rate labor-intensive process
provide sensitive accurate method snp detection fluorescence-based resequencing developed new software tool snpdetector aiming computerize manual review process
report snpdetector's application three large-scale genetic variation studies compare its results those obtained human inspection polyphred experimental validation
first study resequencing was used validate mouse snps discovered whole-genome shotgun sequencing
second study identifies novel snps encode regions human genome third study aims discover mutations induced enu 1,236 zebra fish
