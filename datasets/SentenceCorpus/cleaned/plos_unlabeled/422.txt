 introduction 
maps pairwise protein protein interactions being generated increasing numbers two-hybrid method
genome-scale two-hybrid screens now been conducted saccharomyces cerevisiae caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster
more recently screens been reported herpesviruses human
datasets stimulated large-scale analysis topology protein interaction networks
limitations data both false positives false negatives continue make difficult infer network properties including distinctions basic difference between erd s-r nyi power law other network degree distributions 
recent review points out challenges estimating false-positive rates false-negative rates completion full coverage protein interaction networks
virtually every published method falls back estimate based intersections datasets
false-positive rates methods large variance when assays little overlap indeed could not used analyze existing large-scale maps worm fly
estimates false-negative rates based overlap datasets may even larger uncertainty
finally global estimates false-positive false-negative rates say little about protein-specific properties including whether certain classes proteins behave well badly two-hybrid screens
goal work develop apply statistical model two-hybrid pairwise interaction screens
previous methods typically summarize presence absence interaction 1/0 binary variable possibly split off high-confidence core dataset
method describe reaches back raw counts observed bait prey clones
frees statistical method need external gold standard true-positive true-negative interactions even second dataset
permits protein-specific predictions first time permit tests hypotheses some classes proteins more less likely nonspecific interactions
finally estimates false-negative rates permit statistically grounded confidence intervals total number pairwise interactions present model organism proteomes
flowchart two-hybrid screen orients discussion showing where true-positive interaction partners lost where false-positive spurious interactions may arise
two-hybrid assay one protein fused binding domain yeast transcription factor second protein fused activation domain
physical interactions between bait prey proteins reconstitute transcription factor activity
due expense assay not every protein may selected made into bait prey construct
furthermore some constructs may not functional at all due improper folding incompatibility two-hybrid system
missing interactions important consider when estimating total number interactions proteome
high-throughput two-hybrid screens used multiplexed pairwise tests either testing single bait versus pool preys pooling both baits preys
unnormalized prey pools generated mrna extracted growing cells
access clone collections pools normalized designing baits preys individually each protein protein domain then mixing preys equal proportion
yeast screen considered here tested 62 normalized bait pools versus 62 normalized prey pools each pool having approximately 96 genes
fly screen worm screen each tested one bait turn versus both normalized unnormalized pools
testing occurs using mating transformation express both bait prey construct single yeast cell
true-positive interactions drive reporter genes permit yeast cell grow selective media
yeast cells whose bait prey constructs do not interact expected drop out during population expansion
true positives may also lost during population expansion at least two reasons
first mating transformation may lack enough cells ensure every combination tested
second particular construct may domain-specific misfolding making functional some interactions but nonfunctional others
true interactions not represented cells following population expansion systematic false negatives particular screen
false negatives due insufficient mating/transformation due nonfunctional domains could principle discriminated repeating mating transformation step selective population expansion
without additional step however losses during population expansion combine yield systematic false-negative rate termed 1 p syst p syst representing true-positive rate interacting pair survive population expansion
some cells expressing noninteracting proteins may also survive population expansion final population cells will mixture true positives false positives
figure 1 mass fraction true-positive cells 1 false-positive cells ratio false positives total number true negatives false-positive rate
usually however ratio respect total number observed interactions defined false-discovery rate synonymous parameter 
ongoing point contention two-hybrid screens possibility two proteins never interact vivo host organism might strong reproducible interaction vitro engineered two-hybrid system
conversely proteins strong two-hybrid interaction might nevertheless fail interact vivo
purposes work assume cases rare classify any pair proteins reproducible two-hybrid interaction true positive
while total false-positive fraction may large represents sum over many different false-positive pairs
most models including ours assume any particular false positive rare vanishing probability observing specific false-positive interaction more than once
interactions detected pooled screens often require sequencing identify interacting partners although advanced pooling designs may improve deconvolution efficiency
cost constraints limit number interactions sampled sequencing
if number clones selected sequencing smaller than number true interaction partners bait some true partners will certainly lost
limited sampling depth also truncates observed degree distribution baits
false-negative rate due undersampling termed 1 p samp figure 1
false-discovery rates typically been estimated comparing datasets suggesting up 50 percent false positives but analyses confound false-positive false-negative error sources
estimated error rates large uncertainty because few interactions observed multiple datasets
example comparing uetz ito two-hybrid datasets yeast reveals only 9.1 percent total interactions common comparing two-hybrid interactions mass spectrometry interactions reveals only 0.6 percent common
similarly comparison two fly screens reveals few interactions common
cross-species comparisons also revealed little overlap reported interactions although protein network evolution additional confounding factors
efforts estimate true number interaction partners protein used contingency tables observing interaction multiple screens
methods require all interactions true positives example excluding singleton observations reduce estimated interaction count
notable exception previous work context mass spectrometry protein complexes used bayesian model infer global parameters screen-specific false-positive false-negative rates
parameters then provided posterior estimates probability true interaction given results one more screens
work important using number trials successes rather than single summary yes/no observation its probability model; serves motivation developing similar models more complicated two-hybrid sampling process involving strong protein-specific effects
quantitative predictions amount work required identify some fraction true interactions would analogous formulas genome sequencing would useful planning new experiments
new work presented here uses raw screening data estimate false-negative rate undersampling together false-positive rate
schematic illustrates sampling process
interactions sampled replacement two sets one representing true positives other true negatives
observations number times each interaction sampled summarize three variables: n total number samples drawn; w number unique interactions within n samples; s number interactions observed exactly once
observations estimate unknown values k total number true interaction partners f number false positives within sample n also estimate parameter representing fraction false positives mixture well parameters representing probability distribution k simplicity illustration suggests sampling interactions entire network; reality sampling process occurs separately each bait estimation k f performed separately each bait
estimation problem akin estimating population sizes species counts capture recapture experiments estimating vocabulary size word counts estimating number distinct alleles at particular locus estimating number facts scientific literature
classic capture recapture theory permits heterogeneous capturability rates here analogous different probabilities observing each true interaction partner bait
canonical estimator simple form: w s 2/2k 2 where k 2 number partners observed exactly twice
classic estimator fails two-hybrid setting because does not account false positives
our knowledge false positives never been discussed capture recapture setting
false positives will vastly inflate interaction count adding number singleton observations s total observed count w standard estimator high variance when number observations small yielding small value denominator k 2
estimator fails converge when each partner observed only once yielding n w s k 2 0 
present front-to-back statistical model both false-positive false-negative error rates two-hybrid screens
glossary model terms provided
overall approach start estimating parameters mixture model true positives false positives following population expansion
permits us estimate bait-specific false-discovery rates false-negative rates due undersampling
then back-calculate false-negative rate due systematic effects
putting results together yields overall estimate false-negative rate screen basis comparing interaction lists produced different efforts
along way examine issues our model able address quantitatively: selecting best model protein degree distribution; correlating false-discovery rates bait properties sticky promiscuous domains hydrophobic regions; determining relative performance prey libraries generated cdna libraries orfeome collections
