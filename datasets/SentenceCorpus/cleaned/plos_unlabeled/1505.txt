 
development systemic approaches biology put emphasis identifying genetic modules whose behavior modeled accurately so gain insight into their structure function
however most gene circuits cell under control external signals thus quantitative agreement between experimental data mathematical model difficult
circadian biology been one notable exception: quantitative models internal clock orchestrates biological processes over 24-hour diurnal cycle been constructed few organisms cyanobacteria plants mammals
most cases complex architecture interlocked feedback loops been evidenced
here present first modeling results circadian clock green unicellular alga ostreococcus tauri
two plant-like clock genes been shown play central role ostreococcus clock
find their expression time profiles accurately reproduced minimal model two-gene transcriptional feedback loop
remarkably best adjustment data recorded under light/dark alternation obtained when assuming oscillator not coupled diurnal cycle
suggests coupling light confined specific time intervals no dynamical effect when oscillator entrained diurnal cycle
intringuing property may reflect strategy minimize impact fluctuations daylight intensity core circadian oscillator type perturbation been rarely considered when assessing robustness circadian clocks
 introduction 
real-time monitoring gene activity now allow us unravel complex dynamical behavior regulatory networks underlying cell functions
however understanding collective behavior even few molecular actors defies intuition depends not only topology interaction network but also strengths response times its links
mathematical description regulatory network thus necessary qualitatively quantitatively understand its dynamical behavior but obtaining challenging
state variables parameters subject large fluctuations create artificial complexity mask actual network structure
genetic modules usually not isolated but coupled larger network given gene involved different modules pathways
thus important identify gene circuits whose dynamical behavior modeled quantitatively serve model circuits
one strategy obtaining circuits been construct synthetic networks isolated design
recent experiments shown excellent quantitative agreement obtained incorporating when needed detailed descriptions various biochemical processes 
another strategy study natural gene circuits whose function makes them relatively autonomous stable
circadian clocks drive biological processes around day/night cycle many living organisms natural candidates genetic oscillators keep track most regular environmental constraint: alternation daylight darkness caused earth rotation
informed experiments circadian clock models progressively become more complex evolving single loops featuring self-repressed gene networks interlocked feedback loops 
here report surprisingly good agreement between mathematical model single transcriptional feedback loop expression profiles two central clock genes ostreococcus tauri
microscopic green alga smallest free-living eukaryote known date belongs prasinophyceae one most ancient groups green lineage
ostreococcus displays very simple cellular organization only one mitochondrion one chloroplast
its small genome sequence revealed high compaction very low gene redundancy
cell division cycle ostreococcus under control circadian oscillator cell division occurring at end day light/dark cycles
daily rhythms cell division meet criteria characterizing circadian clock they entrained different photoperiods persist under constant conditions respond light pulses phase shifts depend internal time 
very recently some light been shed molecular workings ostreococcus clock corellou et al
since clock closely related arabidopsis been extensively studied they searched ostreococcus genome orthologs higher plant clock genes found only two similar arabidopsis central clock genes toc1 cca1
two genes display rhythmic expression both under light/dark alternation constant light conditions
functional analysis overexpression/antisense strategy showed toc1 cca1 important clock genes ostreococcus
overexpression toc1 led increased levels cca1 while overexpression cca1 resulted lower levels toc1
furthermore cca1 was shown bind conserved evening element sequence required circadian regulated activity toc1 promoter
whether toc1 cca1 work negative feedback loop could not inferred study since ostreococcus clock appeared rely more than simple toc1/cca1 negative feedback loop
interestingly arabidopsis genes toc1 cca1 were core actors first plant clock model based transcriptional loop where toc1 activates cca1 similar gene lhy whose proteins dimerize repress toc1
however model did not reproduce well expression peaks toc1 cca1 arabidopsis was extended adjust experimental data
current arabidopsis clock models feature several interlocked feedback loops
led us investigate whether transcriptional feedback loop model where toc1 activates cca1 repressed cca1 would relevant ostreococcus
not only found two-gene loop model reproduces perfectly transcript profiles ostreococcus toc1 cca1 but excellent adjustment data recorded under light/dark alternation obtained when no model parameter depends light intensity
counterintuitive finding suggests oscillator not permanently coupled light across 24-hour cycle but only during specific time intervals supported numerical simulations
article propose invisibility coupling entrainment conditions reflects strategy shield oscillator natural fluctuations daylight intensity
