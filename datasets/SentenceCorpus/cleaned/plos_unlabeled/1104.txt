short time scales however distribution too restrictive describe analyze multivariate distributions discrete spike-counts
present alternative based copulas account arbitrary marginal distributions including poisson negative binomial distributions well second higher-order interactions
describe maximum likelihood-based procedures fitting copula-based models spike-count data derive so-called flashlight transformation makes possible move tail dependence arbitrary copula into arbitrary orthant multivariate probability distribution
mixtures copulas combine different dependence structures thereby model different driving processes simultaneously also introduced
first apply copula-based models populations integrate-and-fire neurons receiving partially correlated input show best fitting copulas provide information about functional connectivity coupled neurons extracted using flashlight transformation
then apply new method data were recorded macaque prefrontal cortex using multi-tetrode array
find copula-based distributions negative binomial marginals provide appropriate stochastic model multivariate spike-count distributions rather than multivariate poisson latent variables distribution often used multivariate normal distribution
dependence structure distributions provides evidence common inhibitory input all recorded stimulus encoding neurons
finally show copula-based models successfully used evaluate neural codes e.g characterize stimulus-dependent spike-count distributions information measures
demonstrates copula-based models not only versatile class models multivariate distributions spike-counts but those models exploited understand functional dependencies
 introduction 
so far still unknown statistics crucial analysis order understand neural code
one approach analyze simultaneous spike-counts neural populations
responses populations sensory neurons vary even when same stimulus presented repeatedly variations between simultaneous spike-counts usually correlated at least neighboring neurons
noise correlations been subject substantial number studies
computational reasons however studies typically assume gaussian noise
thus correlated spike rates generally modeled multivariate normal distributions specific covariance matrix describes all pairwise linear correlations
long time intervals high firing rates average number spikes sufficiently large central limit theorem apply normal distribution good approximation spike-count distributions
several experimental findings however suggest processing sensory information take place shorter time scales involving only tens hundreds milliseconds
regime normal distribution no longer valid approximation:
its marginals continuous symmetric shape whereas empirical distributions real spike-counts tend positive skew 
normal distribution heuristically modified order avoid positive probabilities negative values not meaningful spike-counts
major issue low rates probability negative values would high
dependence structure multivariate normal distribution always elliptical whereas spike-count data often show so-called tail-dependence probability mass concentrated one corners 
multivariate normal distribution assumes second order correlations only
although was shown pairwise interactions sufficient describing spike-count distributions retinal ganglion cells cortex cells vitro there evidence significant higher order interactions spike-counts recorded cortical areas vivo 
though not widespread modeling spike-counts alternative models been proposed previous studies poisson distributed marginals separate parameters higher order correlations e.g multiple interaction process model compound poisson model
both models point processes
terms their induced spike-count distributions models special cases multivariate poisson latent variables distribution first introduced kawamura presented compact matrix notation karlis meligkotsidou
similar multivariate normal distribution model also couple shortcomings spike-count modeling: only poisson-marginals modeled
negative correlations cannot represented
dependence structure inflexible: features like tail dependence cannot modeled
use extend versatile class models multivariate discrete distributions overcome shortcomings afore-mentioned models
models based concept copulas allow combine arbitrary marginal distributions using rich set dependence structures
neuroscience they were also applied model distribution continuous first-spike-latencies 
figure 1 illustrates copula concept using spike-count data two real neurons
figure 1a shows bivariate empirical distribution its two marginals
distribution counts depends length time bin used count spikes here formula
case considered correlation at low counts higher than at high counts
called lower tail dependence
figure 1b shows discretized rectified multivariate normal distribution
other hand spike-count probabilities copula-based distribution correspond well empirical distribution figure 1a
