 introduction 
dominant paradigm describing functioning proteins well-defined structured molecular machines undergoing concerted conformational changes while carrying out their function
however over past few years become clear reality much more complex there proteins simply do not defined tertiary structure yet still carry out multitudes different important functions
intrinsically disordered proteins protein segments also called natively unfolded natively disordered definition difficult study using classical methods structural biology but they recent years received significant attention largely due two facts
first become clear proteins extremely abundant
using mostly bioinformatics approaches been shown eukaryotes about 30 percent all proteins largely intrinsically disordered about 50 percent long id stretches
among signaling proteins particular about 70 percent long disordered segments
numbers large: even if some predicted disordered regions actually prove structured likely idps eukaryotes far exceed example entire population membrane proteins
second motivating factor fact idps involved host extremely important cellular functions molecular recognition assembly protein modification entropic chain functions
example complex cellular activities cell signaling regulation often required actions many key molecular players tightly controlled coordinated through interaction recognition based unique identifying features case signaling proteins often located id regions
when recognition multiple binding partners high-specificity/low-affinity binding required choice molecular level often involves idps id regions
finally large numbers idps known involved human diseases cancer neurodegenerative diseases diabetes cardiovascular diseases amyloidoses 
thus far some biggest advances study idps been accomplished through bioinformatics data mining approaches
been shown amino-acid sequences idps tend exhibit high hydrophilicity low sequence entropy lack so-called order-promoting amino acids bulky hydrophobic residues
based features several bioinformatics tools been developed reliably predict level intrinsic disorder given sequence
moreover using mostly nmr small-angle x-ray scattering different spectroscopic methods basic structural features idps been elucidated including their molecular size level structural heterogeneity role transient structure coupled binding-and-folding events aggregation tendencies presence persistent structure
particular combination computer simulation experimentally-determined restraints provided some first ensemble-level pictures idps
however compared our knowledge structure mechanism ordered proteins our understanding idps still extremely rudimentary incomplete primarily because their structural dynamic complexity
present study use molecular dynamics simulations free energy calculations focus role idps extremophile bacterium: deinococcus radiodurans
d
radiodurans non-motile non-spore-forming bacterium belongs deinococcaceae family
characterized extreme ability withstand high doses desiccation ionizing radiation
example bacterium survive dose 5000 gy ionizing radiation inducing more than 200 dna double-strand breaks no effect its viability
however molecular mechanisms underlying high radiation resistance d radiodurans thought evolved primarily side effect mechanisms counter extreme desiccation bacterium thrives dry arid environments
over years evidence accumulated suggesting there exists no single dominant mechanism responsible extremophilic nature d radiodurans but rather combination different mechanisms at play
range passive structural contributions increased genome copy number compact nucleotide organization high intracellular concentration ros-scavenger manganese active enzymatic repair mechanisms including nucleotide base excision repair dna double-strand break repair 
however important mechanisms may also possible bacterium's proteome undergone major structural adaptations order cope environmental stresses
one potential strategy address possibility compare proteome d radiodurans those its non-extremophile relatives look conspicuous differences
recently one us taken exactly approach focused presence putative biological role id regions proteome d radiodurans
subset proteins d radiodurans was identified contain highly hydrophilic stretches low sequence complexity indicative intrinsic disorder absent non-extremophile homologues
interestingly list includes preponderance housekeeping rescue-and-repair proteins including dna polymerase iii nudix hydrolase rotamase abc transporters adenine deaminase lea proteins
further probe significance finding here focus variant nudix hydrolase occuring naturally dimer analyze properties its id regions
nudix hydrolases large class enzymes present all organisms hydrolyze wide range pyrophosphates including nucleotide di triphosphates dinucleotides nucleotide sugars
importantly some members family degrade oxidized nucleotides way prevent potentially mutagenic effects would if incorporated into nucleic acids
other family members regulate concentration metabolic intermediates signaling molecules
interestingly d radiodurans exhibits 26 different types nudix hyrolase about three times more than what would expected given size its genome highest number per mbp any bacterial genome known
particular been reported majority d radiodurans nudix genes strongly induced during stationary phase been implicated metabolic reprogramming
idps tail regions nudix hydrolase extremely dynamic very difficult study x-ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance
however atomistic computer simulations molecular dynamics techniques ideally suited provide complete atomistic picture diverse dynamic ensembles characterizing idps
here using sequence analysis methods molecular dynamics simulations conjunction hydration free energy calculations show id regions protein significantly alter its solvation properties making whole protein significantly more hydrophilic
hypothesize fact principal functional role id regions they evolved keep key housekeeping repair enzymes solvated consequently functional under extreme desiccation conditions
