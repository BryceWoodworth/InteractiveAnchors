 introduction 
genetic basis organismal evolution one fundamental problems biology
modes selection phenotypes would influence fixation probabilities mutations affect phenotypes profile mutations fixed during course evolution would determine architecture genomes genetic systems underlying phenotypes
however because genetic systems would modify phenotypic effects mutations properties genetic system would influence rates directions phenotypic evolution well mutational robustness evolvability
therefore both phenotypes genetic systems evolved mutually influencing each other
gene regulatory networks constitute important parts genetic systems involved various biological processes environmental responses unicellular organisms cell differentiation multicellular organisms
recent theoretical experimental studies revealed complex grns evolved successive gene duplication changes regulatory interactions particularly prokaryotes horizontal gene transfer
addition recent studies addressed structural features complex grns redundancy scale-free outdegree distributions exponential indegree distributions contribution features genetic characteristics mutational robustness evolvability 
one important question regard evolution complex grns evolutionary origin structural mutational properties
various evolutionary processes simultaneously influence grn evolution properties interrelated
thus difficult identify factors promoted evolution properties could evolve result being directly influenced selection also incidentally result other factors
thus identify factors responsible evolution properties complex grns necessary consider not only selection but also various mutational processes constraining processes
selection phenotype one most important driving forces organismal evolution
however impact phenotypic selection evolution grns unclear
mode selection strongly influences fate mutations profile mutations fixed during course evolution ultimately determines architecture grns
thus important examine how different modes phenotypic selection would affect evolution grns
however there significant limitations our general understanding processes adaptation evolutionary biology
many previous studies evolution mutational robustness respect grns focused fixation phenotypically neutral mutations under stabilizing selection constant optimal environment
other hand fixation beneficial mutations phenotypic adaptation under changing environments limited 
many studies suggested some examples grn architectures related mutational robustness evolvability
theoretical studies proposed genetic properties appear evolvable traits genetic properties could play significant role organismal evolution
however unclear how mutational robustness evolvability influences process grn evolution
certain properties grn might evolved through non-adaptive processes mutations biophysical constraints gene regulation
mutations particular ultimate source genetic variation
thus biased properties mutations potentially influence tendency organism evolve
example probability transcription factor binding site formation result mutations could vary several orders magnitude mainly owing extensive variation size potential cis-regulatory regions among organisms rate gene deletion could several times higher than rate gene duplication certain organisms
moreover been suggested horizontal transfer regulatory genes observed lesser extent than phenotypic genes
several studies suggested certain characteristic features complex grns redundancy scale-free degree distributions could evolve inevitable outcome mutations
however previous studies not considered certain essential evolutionary processes selection gene duplication
therefore unclear whether characteristic features complex grns evolved result selection result inherent properties mutations
purpose study was identify evolutionary causes various structural mutational properties complex grns redundancy indegree outdegree distributions mutational robustness evolvability
purpose constructed individual-based model grn dynamically controls gene expression levels allows populations evolve under various fluctuating conditions selection various kinds mutations gene duplication deletion cis trans-regulatory mutation horizontal gene transfer
study explore selective conditions promote evolution complex grns first examine evolution grns under various conditions fluctuating selection
second showing adaptive mechanisms evolution complex grns examine fitness effect all mutations arose during evolution
third explore whether internal factors organisms promote inhibit evolution grns examined impact gene expression cost constraints expression dynamics several types mutational biases relative rates gene duplication deletion possibility formation new transcription factor binding sites horizontal gene transfers
finally basis results above analyses discuss major evolutionary causes various properties complex grns i.e redundancy scale-free out-degree distributions exponential in-degree distributions mutational robustness evolvability
