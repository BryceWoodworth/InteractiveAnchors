present method predict structure protein/ligand complexes based solely apo structure ligand radius gyration holo structure
method applied ten cases proteins undergo structural rearrangements up 7.1 backbone rmsd upon ligand binding
all cases receptor models within 1.6 backbone rmsd target were predicted close-to-native ligand binding poses were obtained 8 10 cases top-ranked complex models
protocol presented expected enable structure modeling protein/ligand complexes structure-based drug design cases where crystal structures ligand-bound conformations not available
 introduction 
interactions between proteins small molecules involved many biochemical phenomena
insight into processes relies detailed knowledge about structure protein/ligand complexes e.g how enzymes stabilize substrates cofactors close proximity
moreover almost all drugs small-molecule ligands interact enzymes receptors channels
accordingly ligand-bound receptor complex structures critical prerequisite understanding biological function structure based drug design
however structure determination protein/ligand-complexes difficult time-consuming expensive
crystal structures protein/ligand complexes usually obtained either co-crystallization soaking common problem even when conditions crystallizing apo-protein well established might not transferable protein/ligand complex
particularly conformational transitions receptor associated ligand binding pose severe challenge structure elucidation holo complexes 
when structures ligand-bound protein conformations not available structure-based drug design becomes highly challenging
several studies showed virtual screening apo-structure usually results poor enrichment factor compared holo-structure even when structural difference between both comparably small
therefore development docking programs aims at allowing certain degree receptor flexibility either using ensemble structures instead single receptor conformation explicitely modeling flexibility sidechain variations predefined flexibility certain parts structure also small variations backbone
incorporating receptor flexibility molecular docking substantial progress been shown enhance both enrichment factors ability predict correct binding poses particularly cases when docking compound receptor structure been crystallized different ligand usually case when searching novel drugs
however degree flexibility thus far limited either sidechain motions small variations backbone thus availability holo-structure apo-structure highly similar holo conformation currently prerequisite successful docking severely limiting structure-based drug design
particularly receptors undergo substantial conformational transition upon ligand binding currently precluded structure based drug design
although protein-ligand crystals suitable diffraction might not accessible several experimental techniques exist detect conformational changes
many cases where proteins undergo domain reorientations upon ligand binding they adopt different shape ligand bound state corresponding change radius gyration studied either nmr where more compact shape causes descrease rotational correlation time small-angle scattering x-rays neutrons
shape descriptions provide invaluable information modeling structures macromolecular assemblies well insight into protein dynamics
here present method predict structure protein/ligand complexes proteins undergo large conformational change upon ligand binding
protocol solely requires apo-structure known ligand experimental data shape holo-structure
here apply radius gyration shape information quantity frequently readily assessed more easily than x-ray structure
developed simulation protocol combines biased conformational sampling docking molecular dynamics simulations applied ten ligand-binding proteins
chose cases where both unbound conformation bound conformation known x-ray crystallography order able a-posteriori validate predicted receptor conformations docking poses
conformational changes involved range 2.1 7.1 backbone rmsd binding site geometries differ substantially between apo holo conformations
nine ten cases predict holo receptor conformations close native ligand-bound conformation eight cases predict ligand binding poses close native state rendering our method suitable blind predictions protein/ligand complexes involving large conformational transitions
