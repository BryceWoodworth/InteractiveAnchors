 introduction 
many biological systems employ cooperative interactions their organization
humans unlike other animal species form large social groups cooperation among non-kin widespread
contrasts general assumption strong selfish individuals ones who benefit most natural selection
being case how possible unselfish behaviour survived evolution
adopting terminology resulting seminal work hamilton trivers wilson act altruistic if confers benefit b another individual spite accruing cost c altruist
context several mechanisms been invoked explain evolution altruism but only recently evolutionary model indirect reciprocity been developed nowak sigmund remarkable simplicity addressed unique aspects human sociality trust gossip reputation
means community enforcement indirect reciprocity had been investigated earlier context economics notably sugden kandori
more recently many studies been devoted investigating how altruism evolve under indirect reciprocity
indeed according alexander indirect reciprocity presumably provides mechanism distinguishes us humans all other living species earth
moreover recently argued indirect reciprocity may provided selective challenge driving cerebral expansion human evolution
indirect reciprocity game any two players supposed interact at most once each other one role potential donor other potential receiver help
each player experience many rounds but never same partner twice direct retaliation being unfeasible
helping another individual given player may increase her reputation may change predisposition others help her future interactions
however her new reputation depends social norm used her peers assess her action donor
previous studies reputation-based models cooperation reviewed recently indicate cooperation outweighs defection whenever among other factors assessment actions based norms require considerable cognitive capacities even when individuals capable making binary assessments only world black white assumed most recent studies
furthermore stable cooperation hinges availability reliable reputation information
high cognitive capacity contrasts technology-based interactions e-trade also rely reputation-based mechanisms cooperation
indeed anonymous one-shot interactions between individuals loosely connected geographically dispersed usually dominate e-trade raising issues trust-building moral hazard
reputation e-trade introduced via feedback mechanism announces ratings sellers
despite success high levels cooperation observed e-trade been found publicizing detailed account seller's feedback history does not improve cooperation compared publicizing only seller's most recent rating
other words practice shows simple reputation-based mechanisms capable promoting high levels cooperation
view previous discussion hard explain success e-trade basis results obtained so far reputation-based cooperation context indirect reciprocity
let us consider world black white consisting set tribes each tribe lives under influence single norm common all individuals
each individual engages once indirect reciprocity game all other tribe inhabitants
her action donor will depend her individual strategy dictates whether she will provide help refuse do depending her recipient's reputation
reputations public: means result every interaction made available everyone through indirect observation model introduced
allows any individual know current status co-player without observing all her past interactions
other hand requires way spread information entire population
consistently language seems important cooperation promoter although recent mechanisms reputation-spreading rely electronic databases
since reputations either good bad there 2 4 16 possible strategies
other hand number possible norms depends their associated order
simplest so-called first-order norms all matters action taken donor
second-order norms reputation one players also contributes decide new reputation donor
so increasing layers complexity shown figure 2 illustrates features third-order norms those shall employ here
any individual tribe shares same norm turn raises question how each inhabitant acquired
do not address issue here
however inasmuch indirect reciprocity associated community enforcement one may assume simplicity norms acquired through educational process
moreover likely common norm contributes overall cohesiveness identity tribe
noteworthy however if norms were different different individuals indirect observation model would not valid requires trust judgments made co-inhabitants
norm order n there possible norms each associated binary string length 2 n consider third-order norms : assessing donor's new reputation observer make contextual judgment involving donor's action well her recipient's reputations scored previous action
introduce following evolutionary dynamics each tribe: during one generation all individuals interact once each other via indirect reciprocity game
when individuals reproduce they replace their strategy another individual same tribe chosen proportional her accumulated payoff
most successful individuals each tribe higher reproductive success
since different tribes under influence different norms overall fitness each tribe will vary tribe tribe well plethora successful strategies thrive each tribe
describes individual selection each tribe
tribes engage pairwise conflicts small probability associated selection between tribes
after each conflict norm defeated tribe will change toward norm victor tribe detailed methods section
consider different forms conflict between tribes reflect different types inter-tribe selection mechanisms: group selection based average global payoff each tribe well selection resulting inter-tribe conflicts modeled terms games display game war attrition extended hawk dove game
perform extensive computer simulations evolutionary dynamics sets 64 tribes each 64 inhabitants
once stationary regime reached collect information subsequent statistical analysis
compute frequency occurrence bits 1 0 each 8-bit locations
bit said fixate if its frequency occurrence exceeds equals 98 percent
otherwise no fixation occurs denote x instead 1 0
analyze 500 simulations same value b subsequently computing frequency occurrence 1 0 x bits 1 0 x respectively
if 1 0 x final bit 1; if 0 1 x final bit 0; otherwise assume indeterminate denote
noteworthy our bit-by-bit selection/transmission procedure though artificial provides simple means mimicking biological evolution where genes interconnected complex networks yet evolve independently
certainly co-evolutionary process would more appropriate will explored future work
