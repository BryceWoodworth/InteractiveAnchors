 introduction 
circadian rhythm daily time-keeping mechanism fundamental wide range species
basic molecular mechanism circadian rhythm been studied extensively
been shown negative transcriptional translational feedback loops formed set key circadian genes responsible giving rise circadian physiology
mammals master clock resides suprachiasmatic nucleus scn orchestrates circadian clocks peripheral tissues directing secretion hormones glucocorticoids
through many years molecular genetic studies at least 19 key circadian genes per family cry family bmal1 clock npas2 dec1/dec2 rev-erb / rora/rorb/rorc dbp/tef/hlf e4bp4 been identified mammals
now commonly accepted arntl clock proteins form complex positively regulates transcription per cry family genes through activating cis-regulatory element e-box their promoters
per cry family proteins form complex inhibits arntl/clock transcriptional activity thus completing negative feedback loop
other key circadian genes dbp nfil3 controlling d-box element rora/rorb/rorc nr1d1/nr1d2 controlling rre also been shown important mammalian circadian rhythm
since 2002 there been series microarray experiments aimed at identifying circadian oscillating genes at genome-wide level various tissues mammalian species including mouse rat rhesus macaque human
experiments usually identified hundreds circadian oscillating genes suggesting circadian rhythm drives genomewide circadian oscillation gene expression
however microarray data intrinsically noisy further microarray experiments differed animals they used experimental conditions sampling times etc indeed microarray experiments so far not been compared integrated
few cases where two tissues were studied single experiment overlap circadian oscillating genes between tissues was very limited
assuming set common circadian genes exists most tissues cell types integration different circadian microarray datasets multiple tissues could potentially identify common set circadian genes
comparison circadian oscillating genes their oscillating patterns across different tissues help us understand tissue-specific functions circadian rhythm
comparison across different mammalian species also shed light molecular mechanisms lead their different physiologies behaviors
because many known key circadian genes arntl/clock nr1d1/nr1d2 dbp/nfil3 transcription factors transcriptional regulation must played important role genome-wide circadian oscillation gene expression
ueda et al constructed small-scale gene regulatory network consisting 16 genes 3 cis-regulatory elements based vitro luciferase reporter assays
however construction circadian gene regulatory network at system level based promoter analysis alone been almost impossible due difficulties transcription factor binding site prediction
existence other cis-regulatory elements associated circadian oscillation remained elusive
other hand there large body microarray experiments transcription factor knockout mutant animals currently available at public databases
incorporating knockout mutant microarray experiment results promoter sequence analysis greatly facilitate identification functional transcription factor binding sites
general construction analysis gene regulatory networks involved mammalian circadian rhythm will improve our understanding how key circadian genes driving circadian-controlled genes will pave way more detailed quantitative modeling mammalian circadian rhythm
