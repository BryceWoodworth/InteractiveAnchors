contraction heart fundamental whole organ phenomenon driven cellular mechanisms
each beat myocytes heart generate tension relax
local cellular scale tension transduced into coordinated global whole heart deformation resulting effective organized efficient system level pump function
fundamental achieving efficient transudation work integration organ tissue cellular scale mechanisms
however while efficiency important heart role relative importance underlying mechanisms responsible achieving efficient transduction work cell organ remains unclear
healthy heart structural heterogeneities morphology electrophysiology metabolic neural mechanisms provide stable physiological framework facilitates coordinated contraction resulting etw
however over shorter time scales sub cellular mechanisms most likely candidates regulating etw face dynamic variation cardiac demand

four major tdf mechanisms length dependent changes ca 2 sensitivity filament overlap tension dependent binding ca 2 troponin c velocity dependent cross bridge kinetics
tdf mechanisms 1 2 characterised length dependent changes steady state force ca 2 relationship routinely described hill curve
length dependent changes ca 50 measured decreased concentration ca 2 required produce half maximal activation muscle increases length
length dependent changes filament overlap result active tension increasing muscle increases length
ca 2 binding tnc acts switch activating tension generation
crossbridges bind generate tension they increase affinity ca 2 tnc causing more ca 2 bind results generation more tension
velocity dependence tension described transient stable component
transient component characterised multiphase tension response step changes length stable component characterised tension during contraction at constant velocity
general velocity contraction increases active tension decreases
