starting finite state projection solution chemical master equation develop efficient numerical tools accurately computing competence probability
additionally propose new approach sensitivity analysis stochastic events utilize elucidate robustness properties competence regulatory genetic circuit
also propose implement numerical method calculate expected time takes cell return competence
although study focused example cell-differentiation bacillus subtilis our approach applied wide range stochastic phenomena biological systems
 introduction 
competence ability cell usually bacterium bind internalize transforming exogenous dna
under stressful environments nutrient limitations some cells enter competence while other cells commit irreversibly sporulation
entry competence transient probabilistic event facilitates copying exogenous dna
been shown among group cells only randomly chosen fraction enters competence
proper modeling correctly accounting noise model phenomenon crucial understanding underlying biological explanation
few cells enter competence express high concentration key regulator comk activates hundreds genes including genes encoding dna-uptake recombination systems
competence understood bistability pattern nonlinear system describing competence regulatory circuit excitable dynamical system
auto-activation regulator comk responsible bistable response competence development
auto-activation comk essential sufficient generate bistable expression pattern
specifically concentration inducer must cross certain threshold start positive feedback
different experimental studies concluded auto activation comk only needed factor bistability occur expression protein
smits et
al discuss factors determine required threshold activation comk deduce other transcription factors raise lower threshold
although many proteins involved regulation competence there two main proteins play major role
s el et al propose deterministic model driven additive noise describe dynamics competence regulation
use reduced order stochastic differential equation model presented develop discrete stochastic model competence
calculating probability expected time entering returning competence requires solving splitting probabilities first moment passage time
problem calculating first passage time been studied heavily literature stochastic difference equations fokker planck equations some special cases cme
detailed treatment topic see references therein
researchers usually use monte-carlo simulations calculate distribution first passage time when working he cme
propose work alternative approach makes possible calculate states system will time evolves
main idea here aggregate regions state space over specie evolve into absorbing states
technique useful analytically computing distribution first passage time providing way deal infinite dimension state space over system evolves
contributions paper threefold

second shows how calculate sensitivities probabilities passing transient state respect system's parameters
third gives methodology calculate expected time takes cell return its transient state
all methods used analyze any biological system characteristic switching between two states while staying while unstable state
paper start describing chemical reactions deterministic model
then generate chemical master equation our proposed discrete stochastic model
cme characterizes evolution probability density different discrete states
simulate using stochastic simulation algorithm show how solution approximated using finite state projection method
then conduct sensitivity analysis studying effect various system parameters probability cell enters competence

finally analyze roles parameters determining expected time cell stays competence
