 introduction 
understanding protein folding thermodynamics kinetics central issue molecular biology computer-aided modeling becoming increasingly useful also field
direct comparison between simulations experiments requires both accurate description system possibility sample extensively configuration space
order observe folding molecular dynamics necessary use very large computers worldwide distributed computing enhanced sampling technique 
system almost ideal theoretical investigation trp-cage designed 20-residue miniprotein folds rapidly spontaneously globular structure
nmr structure reveals compact hydrophobic core trp side chain buried
secondary structure elements include short formula 3 10-helix polyproline ii helix at c-terminus
folding mechanism system been studied several experimental techniques
calorimetry circular dichroism spectroscopy fluorescence show cooperative two-state folding behavior transition midpoint at approximately 314 k relaxation time 3.1 s at 296 k
uv-resonance raman reveals more complex unfolding behavior presence compact intermediate retains formula character hydrophobic core even more compact
nmr experiments show substantially cooperative thermal unfolding but large negative chemical shift deviations formula formula suggest those residues might pack more tightly temperature raised
also fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments cannot interpreted terms simple two-state folding formation molten-globule-like intermediate been proposed 
atomistic modeling trp-cage folding been studied using several different approaches
particular all-atom explicit-solvent description folding trp-cage been studied replica exchange molecular dynamics
starting extended configuration structure formula root mean square deviation 2 nmr reference structure obtained after 100 ns simulation 40 replicas
relatively high melting temperature 440 k predicted
other studies suggested even if trp-cage rather small system achieving statistical convergence remd simulation may require much longer simulation times
kinetics trp-cage folding was studied explicit solvent transition path sampling transition interface sampling
folding trp-cage was also investigated two us using bias exchange metadynamics approach metadynamics potentials acting different collective variables exchanged among molecular dynamics simulations performed at same temperature
using method possible explore simultaneously virtually unlimited number cvs
since all md simulations performed at same temperature number replicas does not grow system size like remd approach ref

using was possible reversibly fold trp-cage villin headpiece advillin headpiece together two their mutants insulin chain b using explicit solvent force field less than 100 nanoseconds simulation only eight replicas
recently method was also used exploring mechanism enzyme reactions 
atomistic simulations biological systems after exhaustive exploration achieved necessary extract trajectory relevant metastable conformations assign their occupation probability compute rates transitions among them
several methods been developed scope
methods big advantage reducing complex dynamics high-dimensional configuration space markov process describing transitions among finite number metastable states
they suitable analyzing ergodic molecular dynamics trajectory but they cannot straightforwardly applied if system evolved under action external bias
paper present method allows exploiting statistics accumulated bias exchange metadynamics run constructing detailed kinetic thermodynamic model complex process trp-cage folding
approach presented here aims at extracting same information simulation one obtain analysis long ergodic md run several shorter runs
method relies projection trajectory space defined set variables assumed describe relevant physics system
variables not necessarily ones used simulation chosen formula
once cvs selected rate model constructed following three steps:
cluster analysis performed trajectories possibly extended cv space assigning each configuration explored during biased dynamics reference structure close cv space
next equilibrium population each bin calculated simulations using weighted histogram analysis method exploiting metadynamics bias potentials
finally kinetic model constructed assigning rates transitions among bins
transition rates assumed form introduced ref
namely depend exponentially free energy difference between bins prefactor determined diffusion matrix formula bins relative position
only free parameter model formula free energies already assigned
following ref
formula estimated maximizing likelihood unbiased md trajectory 
model constructed manner designed optimally reproduce long time scale dynamics system
used example characterizing metastable misfolded intermediates folding process
advantage using biased trajectories besides acceleration slow transitions greatly enhanced accuracy estimated free energy at transition state regions
approach first illustrated ace-ala 3-nme peptide
system simple enough allow benchmarking results against long standard md simulation
system model capable reproducing excellent accuracy kinetics thermodynamics observed unbiased run
same approach then applied trp-cage miniprotein
model built allows describing folding process computing folding rates nmr spectra simulating t-jump experiment etc scenario emerges good agreement available experimental data
kinetic monte carlo markov cluster analysis several metastable sets identified
states except folded cluster considered misfolded intermediates folding process
at 298 k two main clusters present population 58 percent 25 percent respectively
most populated folded state its structural properties very close nmr ensemble
second most populated cluster retains significant amount secondary structure but formula native state approximately 4.4
cluster trp trapped hydrophobic pocket its distance pro12 gly11 reduced
presence cluster thermal ensemble system explain some anomalies temperature behavior observed nmr uv-raman experiments
structures most populated misfolded intermediates good agreement unfolded states distances reported ref

using kinetic model fluorescence t-jump experiment also simulated
agreement experimental results relaxation time 2.3 0.7 s found
time primarily determined relaxation towards folded state compact molten globule-like structure acts kinetic trap
relaxation times among all other clusters including transitions between fully unstructured states folded state all sub-microsecond time domain
thus surprisingly relaxation time measured fluorescence may not directly related folding transition if one calls folding transition random coil native state
