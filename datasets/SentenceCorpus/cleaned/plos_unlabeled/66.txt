 
massive amounts data being generated effort represent brain expression all genes at cellular resolution
critical exploiting effort ability place data into common frame reference
here developed computational method annotating gene expression patterns context digital atlas facilitate custom user queries comparisons type data
procedure been applied 200 genes postnatal mouse brain
illustration utility identify candidate genes may related parkinson disease using expression dopamine transporter substantia nigra search query pattern
addition discover transcription factor rorb down-regulated barrelless mutant relative control mice quantitative comparison expression patterns layer iv somatosensory cortex
semi-automated annotation method developed here applicable broad spectrum complex tissues data modalities
 introduction 
high-resolution maps gene expression provide important information about how genes regulate biological processes at cellular molecular levels
therefore multitude efforts progress depict gene expression at single cell resolution specimens ranging organs embryos
common genome-scale projects they generate vast numbers images expression patterns reveal presence transcripts proteins particular cell group cells within natural context
however large collections images limited usefulness per se without efficient means mine images characterize compare gene protein expression patterns
analogy requirements mining genomic sequence information meaningful retrieval expression patterns requires suitable annotation
annotation mean associating sites strengths expression digital representation anatomy specimen
annotation approach taken gene expression database hand-curate published gene expression patterns using extensive dictionary anatomical terms
annotation facilitated edinburgh mouse atlas project provides anatomical ontology relationships using hierarchical tree
visualization achieved associating terms locations volumetric model
edinburgh mouse atlas project also provides tools map situ hybridization images directly into three-dimensional atlas
although hand curation effective method annotation not efficient means handling large-scale datasets systematically collected robotic ish
addition if future changes made anatomical designations updating annotation may require laborious review previously annotated data
here present completely novel approach uses geometric modeling technique create digital atlas postnatal day 7 mouse brain
deformable atlas then adjusted match major anatomical structures present p7 mouse brain tissue sections accurately define boundaries between structures provide smooth multi-resolution coordinate representation small structures
when combining technique method detecting strength gene expression one efficiently automatically annotate large number gene expression patterns way subsequently allows queries comparisons expression patterns user-defined regions interest
p7 mouse brain was selected specimen because at developmental stage many complex brain functions begin established yet existing information underlying molecular mechanisms still relatively limited
describe here creation prototype 200-gene dataset generated using robotic ish application our deformable atlas-based annotation method dataset
then demonstrate utility approach two examples: searching genes expressed substantia nigra identifying genes potentially involved functional regionalization cortex
