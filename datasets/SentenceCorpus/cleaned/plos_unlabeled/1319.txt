multicellular organisms cell migration paramount importance physiological processes tissue homeostasis repair immune surveillance response developmental patterning
culture crawling mammalian cells surface coated extracellular matrix protein fibronectin classically described cycle distinct subprocesses: membrane protrusion formation new adhesive bonds underlying substratum at cell's leading edge followed contraction cell body forwards finally detachment adhesions at cell's rear
primary molecular hubs integration subprocesses integrins adhesion receptors recognize specific ecm proteins
upon ligation integrins cluster form adhesive contacts orchestrate activation host signal transduction pathways anchorage actin filaments inside cell
thus they provide not only physical linkages between ecm actin cytoskeleton through myosin ii motors generate contractile force but also platforms localizing biochemical signals govern leading edge protrusion
