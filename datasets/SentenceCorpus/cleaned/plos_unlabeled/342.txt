 introduction 
role mechanistic mathematical modeling systems biology will play molecular medicine clinical development remains uncertain
kitano suggested understanding critical questions biology required integration experimental computational research
assmus et al others maintained analysis dynamics human relevant networks using predictive computer models high-throughput data generation would play increasingly important role medical research elucidation disease mechanisms
however parametric structural uncertainty remains open challenge mechanistic modeling medicine
strategies integrate experimental computational techniques had success at elucidating network structures
arm arkin reviewed experimental computational techniques uncover molecular interaction networks
central experimental advancements area protein protein network identification been yeast two-hybrid system quantitative mass spectrometry proteomic techniques determine protein complexes
young coworkers explored protein dna interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation technique where likely transcription factor binding sites were determined using combination chromatin immunoprecipitation chips dna microarrays
time-lagged correlation matrices genetic programming techniques network decomposition strategies also been used time-series concentration measurements estimate reaction network structures 
sensitivity analysis been used integrate model identification discrimination optimal experimental design knowledge discovery
cho et al used sensitivity analysis study tnf mediated nf b signalling where parametric uncertainty was addressed using monte carlo sensitivity analysis; using best-guess parameter set family random parameter sets was generated where sensitivity coefficients were calculated each member random family
cho et al went develop unifying framework building upon earlier work kholodenko et al sontag et al unravel functional interactions biomolecular networks using stimulus response strategy metabolic control analysis
kremling et al investigated benchmark problem growth microorganism continuous bioreactor subject feed shifts using sensitivity-based model identification discrimination strategies; they determined optimal experimental design perturbation strategies identify discriminate between rival model formulations
gadkar et al identified signal transduction models time-course measurements using nonlinear scheme estimate missing protein measurements measured values
they went further proposed strategies calculate d-optimal experimental designs maximized experimental information used identify signal transduction models well iterative strategy explore model structure
sensitivity analysis also been used explore robustness fragility metabolic signaling networks
robustness ability maintain system performance face perturbation uncertainty desirable feature both biological well man-made networks machines systems
conversely fragility i.e extreme sensitivity small perturbations very undesirable trait could lead catastrophic system failure following seemingly innocuous perturbations e.g boeing 777 crashing because minor software failures microscopic alterations few integrated chips
stelling et al reviewed several examples robustness biological networks while leibler first computationally predicted later experimentally verified robust features chemotaxis control networks
bullinger coworkers explored robustness models programmed cell death apoptosis while stelling et al computationally identified points robustness fragility using monte carlo sensitivity analysis overall state sensitivity coefficients models circadian rhythm

test our working hypothesis computationally screening mechanistic model well-studied coagulation cascade developed validated literature sources
after model validation using 21 published datasets generated two different quiescent vitro coagulation models use monte carlo sensitivity analysis computationally screen model sensitive mechanisms presence absence natural anticoagulants
then contrast predicted fragile mechanisms literature determine if they consistent experimental investigation thereby proving disproving our working hypothesis
while current development restricted coagulation broader strategy general could applied arbitrary network

fxa activates downstream factors including fv fviii fix
fxa also along fva form complex surface activated platelets converts prothrombin thrombin
tf fviia not only mechanism activate fx; fixa fviiia complex surface activated platelets catalyze formation fxa
platelet localization at wound site occurs through specific interactions between platelet subendothelium primarily through recognition exposed materials collagen fibronectin von willebrand factor
localized platelets activated external signals adenosine diphosphate thrombin
thrombin irreversibly activates platelets through family transmembrane receptors platelet surface called protease-activated receptors
thrombin addition playing key role platelet activation catalyzes conversion fibrinogen fibrin

thrombin also activates upstream coagulation factors thereby forming strong positive feedback ensures rapid activation
