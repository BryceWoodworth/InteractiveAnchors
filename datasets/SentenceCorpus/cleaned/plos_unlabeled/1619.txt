 introduction 
during embryonic development complex multicellular organisms spatial reference points need established within tissues
often formed specialized groups cells capable signaling neighboring cells
signaling centers define coordinate systems along newly arising cells orient themselves make crucial decisions regarding proliferation differentiation migration
because their pervasive importance tissue-organizing centers need precisely controlled both spatially temporally well respect their signaling amplitude
one possible mechanism spatial control tissue organizers restrict movement cells at fixed boundary positions
phenomenon indeed observed involves separation groups cells already been spatially instructed assume distinct identities example at segment parasegment-boundaries
akin water oil two cell populations seen establish maintain relatively straight interface each other effectively minimizing their contact area
minimizing force assumed help stabilize interface against random perturbations may arise cell divisions arbitrary cell movements; thus any organizing activity associated interface likewise stabilized
how separation sorting cells distinct identities achieved
one line work attributes differential cell adhesion : cell populations might develop distinct adhesive properties; affinity differences would then allow them sort out one another
another line reasoning based differential interfacial tension : hypothesis suggests cells might actively constrict surfaces contact neighboring cells depending cellular identity neighbors and/or depending signaling events
both mechanisms would ultimately lead physical forces would help keep cell populations apart
developing wing primordium drosophila particularly well suited study boundary formation
not required larval viability manipulated experimentally through advanced genetic toolkit been well characterized
disc contains compartment boundary separates anterior posterior cells; boundary inherited specification events occurring early embryo
initial embryonic events give rise boundary involve mutual signaling between stripes cells mediated extensively studied network genes
once established cellular identities both sides boundaries stable throughout larval development well into adult life
compartment boundary disc strictly respected all cells even when cells one side boundary artificially provided competitive growth advantage over cells other side boundary
wing disc itself simple flat epithelial sheet orientations cell divisions appear largely random
genetic analysis computational modeling tissue simplified fact daughter cells arising cell divisions usually remain physical contact do not migrate away each other
been shown experimentally tracing descendents single cells; most cases clone offspring cells will form coherent patch connected cells
behavior suggests complicated processes cell intercalation migration neglected first approximation when studying boundary maintenance tissue
working wing discs recent seminal study begun shed light possible boundary formation mechanisms
authors directly demonstrated increased mechanical tension at cell-to-cell interfaces located immediately at boundary using laser ablation experiments
subsequent computer simulations then revealed collectively local forces sufficient maintain stable compartment boundary
results intriguing but they raise number new questions: boundary formation wing disc known depend secreted diffusible signaling protein hedgehog produced posterior cells specifically sensed transduced anterior cells
if diffusible hh indeed somehow influences mechanical tension what conditions must then met ensure well-defined boundary
so far all known transcriptional responses hh signaling occurring several cell-diameters wide into responding tissue
how response case restricted immediate boundary region
furthermore experimental suppression hh signaling been shown lead ectopic boundary formation distant actual boundary
does mean influence hh signaling does extend beyond actual boundary if so why does not noticeable consequence wild type situation
here propose mechanistic model generate localized outcome hh signaling respect physical forces mechanical properties despite longer range molecular response terms target gene expression
furthermore estimate distance boundary up hh signaling may able prime cells boundary formation; distance inferred using both experimental results well modeling results estimate at least 10 cell diameters
approach problem first formulating explicit two-dimensional model hh production diffusion transduction then coupling setup physical model growing tissue
our modeling approach cells their contact surfaces described graph connected vertexes
our model essentially follows differential interface tension hypothesis; modified version model been previously established very same tissue
observe good compartment boundary formation over range simulation parameters modeling outcomes agree qualitatively experimental perturbations specifically performed study
