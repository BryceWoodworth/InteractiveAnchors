 introduction 
now more than 60 years since alan hodgkin categorized firing behaviour his classical study isolated axons crab carcinus maenas
many respects his experiments still form basis analysis firing patterns nervous systems
using threshold dynamics maximum frequency parameters he identified two major classes repetitively firing axons : class 1 axons start firing very low frequency at threshold stimulation yielding continuous f-i stim relationship whereas class 2 axons start firing abruptly relatively high frequency at threshold yielding discontinuous f-i stim relationship
basis similar categorization mammalian cortical neurons also been separated into main classes one exhibiting class 1 characteristics another class 2 characteristics
former class consists primarily pyramidal neurons latter primarily interneurons
differential classification excitability been shown correlate differential bifurcation behaviour corresponding dynamical models successfully been used analysing coding properties neurons
avoid confusion accordance notation tateno robinson following use terms type 1 type 2 dynamics when referring continuous discontinuous f-i stim relationships respectively
classification takes threshold dynamics regular fast spiking neurons class 1 2 axons into account but not all behavioural aspects classes 
intricate interactions between many factors involved dynamical regulation neuronal firing poorly understood
dominant idea different combinations ion channel types explain different patterns
previous study proposed complementary explanation
showed both type 1 type 2 behaviour simulated dynamical model hippocampal neuron varying membrane density voltage-gated na k channels
model used was four-dimensional based detailed experimental voltage-clamp study thus comprising experimentally estimated parameters
choice ion channel densities bifurcation parameters was due their physiological pharmacological relevance
many drugs act specifically blocking channels thereby reducing ion channel density both at somatic at axonal level
perhaps most used local anaesthetic drug lidocaine acts blocking sodium channels axons sensory nerve endings
increasing number studies suggest role physiological regulation channel densities even at relatively short time scale 
each type dynamics i.e type 1 2 was found associated distinct regions channel density plane corresponding surface areas oscillation volume formula formula i stim space
regions high formula low formula values model exhibits type 1 dynamics whereas regions higher formula values model generates type 2 dynamics
bifurcation analysis showed type 1 dynamics model due saddle-node invariant circle bifurcations
figure 3a portrays bifurcation v-i stim plot calculated model using region c1 values
type 2 dynamics was found due either local andronov-hopf bifurcations and/or global double limit cycle bifurcations
dynamics model associated region b values due double limit cycle subcritical andronov-hopf bifurcations while dynamics associated region a2 exclusively due double limit cycle bifurcations
double limit cycle bifurcation implies unstable limit cycle part separating structure separates trajectories turning central stable point those approaching stable limit cycle
however preliminary calculations suggested bifurcation structure at border between regions b c1 more complex than previously described
when more bifurcation parameters changed more intricate loss stability occurs 
thus obtain better understanding processes reanalysed hippocampal neuron model more detail
furthermore extended analysis two other well-described excitable membranes i.e myelinated axon xenopus laevis giant axon loligo forbesi
found oscillations associated subregion region c1 hippocampal model show type 2 dynamics oscillations both axon models exclusively show type 2 dynamics
investigated mathematical background findings using techniques bifurcation theory
results suggest hippocampal soma two studied axon membranes represent two distinct types membrane respect excitability pattern; membranes channel-density dependent switching between type 1 2 dynamics membranes channel-density independent dynamics
difference between two membrane types suggests functional differences compatible more flexible role soma membrane than axon membrane
