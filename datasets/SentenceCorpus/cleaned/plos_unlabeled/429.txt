 introduction 
early identification adverse effects preclinical commercial drugs crucial developing highly efficient therapeutics since unexpected adverse drug effects contribute one-third all drug failures late stage drug development
conventional practices identifying off-targets rely counterscreen compounds against large number enzymes receptors vitro
computational approaches could not only save time costs spent during vitro screening providing candidate list potential off-targets but also provide insight into understanding molecular mechanisms protein drug interactions
been shown potential off-targets identified silico establishing structure activity relationship small molecules
however success ligand-based methods strongly depends availability coverage chemical structures used training few them directly take target 3d structure into account
although assessment protein ligand interactions docking studies at atomic level extremely valuable understanding molecular mechanism adverse therapeutic effects protein ligand docking large scale hindered biased structural coverage human proteome lack practical methodologies accurately estimate binding affinity
here approach problem different direction postulating proteins similar binding sites likely bind similar ligands
study test postulate predicting potential off-target binding sites selective estrogen receptor modulators
several commercial drugs targeting estrogen receptor alpha been developed treat breast cancers other diseases
however therapy drugs tamoxifen associated undesirable side effects cardiac abnormalities thromboembolic disorders ocular toxicity
identify off-targets serms attempt elucidate molecular mechanisms explaining their adverse effects searched similar ligand binding sites across fold functional space using template known serm binding site er
search used robust scalable functional site prediction comparison algorithm developed recently our laboratory 22; xie bourne submitted
consequently similar inhibitor site detected sacroplasmic reticulum ca2 ion channel atpase protein
prediction further verified detailed protein ligand docking surface electrostatic potential analysis
our prediction correlates well clinical biochemical observations providing molecular insight into reducing adverse effect serms
strategy used case study could applied discover off-targets other commercially available pharmaceuticals repurpose existing drugs treat different diseases xie kinnings bourne preparation
process could also included drug discovery development pipeline effort optimize drug leads reduce unwanted side effects
