however therapy often fails due evolution acquired resistance
one long-standing question clinical cancer research identification optimum therapeutic administration strategies so risk resistance minimized
paper investigate optimal drug dosing schedules prevent at least delay emergence resistance
design analyze stochastic mathematical model describing evolutionary dynamics tumor cell population during therapy
consider drug resistance emerging due single genetic alteration calculate probability resistance arising during specific dosing strategies
then optimize treatment protocols risk resistance minimal while considering drug toxicity side effects constraints
our methodology used identify optimum drug administration schedules avoid resistance conferred one genetic alteration any cancer treatment type
 introduction 
alteration normal regulation cell-cycle progression division death lies at heart processes driving tumorigenesis
detailed molecular understanding processes provides opportunity design targeted anti-cancer agents
term targeted therapy refers drugs focused mechanism specifically act well-defined protein targets biological pathways when altered therapy impair abnormal proliferation cancer cells
examples type therapy include hormonal-based therapies breast prostate cancer; small-molecule inhibitors egfr pathway lung breast colorectal cancers erlotinib gefitinib cetuximab ; inhibitors jak2 flt3 bcr-abl tyrosine kinases leukemias imatinib dasatinib nilotinib ; blockers invasion metastasis; anti-angiogenesis agents like bevacizumab ; proapoptotic drugs; proteasome inhibitors bortezomib
target-driven approach drug development contrasts conventional more empirical approach used develop cytotoxic chemotherapeutics successes past few years illustrate power concept
absence prolonged clinical responses many cases however stresses importance continued basic studies into mechanisms targeted drugs their failure clinic
acquired drug resistance important reason failure targeted therapies
resistance emerges due drug metabolism drug export alteration drug target mutation deletion overexpression
depending cancer type its stage therapy administered genetic background patient one several genetic alterations may necessary confer drug resistance cells
paper investigate drug resistance emerging due single alteration
example treatment chronic myeloid leukemia targeted agent imatinib fails due acquired point mutations bcr-abl kinase domain
date ninety different point mutations been identified each sufficient confer resistance imatinib
second-generation bcr-abl inhibitors dasatinib nilotinib circumvent most mutations confer resistance imatinib; t315i mutation however causes resistance all bcr-abl kinase inhibitors developed so far
similarly t790m point mutation epidermal growth factor receptor confers resistance egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib erlotinib used treat non-small cell lung cancer
other mechanisms resistance include gene amplification overexpression p-glycoprotein family membrane transporters decreases intracellular drug accumulation changes cellular proteins involved detoxification activation drug changes molecules involved dna repair activation oncogenes her-2/neu c-myc ras well inactivation tumor suppressor genes like p53 
design optimal drug administration schedules minimize risk resistance represents important issue clinical cancer research
currently many targeted drugs administered continuously at sufficiently low doses so no drug holidays necessary limit side effects
alternatively drug may administered at higher doses short pulses followed rest periods allow recovery toxicity
clinical studies evaluating advantages different approaches been ambivalent
some investigations found low-dose continuous strategy more effective while others advocated more concentrated dosages
effectiveness low-dose continuous approach often attributed its targeted effect tumor endothelial cells prevention angiogenesis rather than low rates resistance
continuous dosing strategy often implemented combination therapy sometimes including second drug administered at higher dose pulsed fashion
significant amount research effort been devoted developing mathematical models tumor growth response chemotherapy
seminal paper norton simon proposed model kinetic resistance cell-cycle specific therapy tumor growth followed gompertzian law
authors used differential equation model rate cell kill was proportional rate growth unperturbed tumor given size
they suggested one way combating slowing rate tumor regression was increase intensity treatment tumor became smaller thus increasing chance cure
authors also published review clinical trials employing dosing schedules related their proposed dose-intensification strategy concluded concept intensification was clinically feasible possibly efficacious
later predictions extension model were validated clinical trial evaluating effects dose-dense strategy conventional regimen chemotherapy
their model its predictions become known norton-simon hypothesis generated substantial interest mathematical modeling chemotherapy kinetic resistance
example dibrov colleagues formulated kinetic cell-cycle model describe cell synchronization cycle phase-specific blockers ; model was then used optimizing treatment schedules increase degree synchronization thus effectiveness cycle-specific drug
agur introduced another model describing cell-cycle dynamics tumor host cells investigate effect drug scheduling responsiveness chemotherapy ; model was then used optimize scheduling chemotherapeutics maximize efficacy while controlling host toxicity
other theoretical studies include mathematical model tumor recurrence metastasis during periodically pulsed chemotherapy control theoretic approach optimal dosing strategies evaluation chemotherapeutic strategies light their anti-angiogenic effects
more comprehensive survey kinetic models tumor response chemotherapy refer reader reviews references therein
there also been substantial research efforts devoted developing mathematical models genetic resistance i.e resistance driven genetic alterations cancer cells
since mutations conferring resistance arise random events during dna replication phase cell division dynamics resistant populations well-suited description stochastic mathematical models
coldman co-authors pioneered field introducing stochastic models resistance against chemotherapy guide treatment schedules
1986 coldman goldie studied emergence resistance one two functionally equivalent chemotherapeutic drugs using branching process model tumor growth differentiation hierarchy
model birth death rates cells were time-independent constants each sensitive cell division gave rise resistant cell certain probability
effect drug was modeled additional probabilistic cell kill law existing population drug could administered fixed dose at series fixed time points
goal model was schedule sequential administration both drugs order maximize probability cure
later assumption equivalence symmetry between two drugs was relaxed
models were also extended include toxic effects chemotherapy normal tissue optimal control problem was formulated maximize probability tumor cure without toxicity
more recently iwasa colleagues used multi-type birth-death process model study probability resistance emerging due one multiple mutations populations under selection pressure
authors considered pre-existing resistance mutations determined optimum intervention strategy utilizing multiple drugs
multi-drug resistance was also investigated using multi-type birth-death process model work komarova wodarz
their models resistance each drug was conferred genetic alterations within mutational network
birth death rates each cell type were time-independent constants cells had additional drug-induced death rate if they were sensitive one more drugs
authors studied evolution resistant cells both before after start treatment calculated probability treatment success under continuous treatment scenarios variable number drugs
recently dynamics resistance emerging due one two genetic alterations clonally expanding population sensitive cells prior start therapy were studied using time-homogenous multi-type birth-death process 
one common feature models genetic resistance treatment effect formulated additional probabilistic cell death rate sensitive cells separate underlying birth death process model constant birth death rates
under model assumptions drug cannot alter proliferation rate either sensitive resistant cells; however main effect many targeted therapies inhibition proliferation cancer cells
inhibited proliferation turn leads reduced probability resistance since resistant cells generated during sensitive cell divisions
paper utilize non-homogenous multi-type birth-death process model wherein birth death rates both sensitive resistant cells dependent temporally varying drug concentration profile
study represents significant departure existing models resistance since incorporate effect inhibition sensitive cell proliferation well drug-induced death obtaining more accurate description evolutionary dynamics system
addition generalize our model incorporate partial resistance so drug may also effect birth death rates resistant cells
goals our analysis also differ those previous work
coldman murray were interested finding optimal administration strategy multiple chemotherapeutic drugs combination sequential administration ; they aimed maximize probability cure while limiting toxicity
komarova was interested studying effect multiple drugs administered continuously probability eventual cure
contrast paper derive estimates expected size resistant cell population well probability resistance during full spectrum continuous pulsed treatment schedules one targeted drug
then propose methodology selecting optimal strategy spectrum minimize probability resistance well maximally delay progression disease controlling expected size resistant population while incorporating toxicity constraints
many clinical scenarios probability resistance high regardless dosing strategy thus maximal delay disease progression more realistic objective than tumor cure
methodology developed paper applied study acquired resistance any cancer treatment type
