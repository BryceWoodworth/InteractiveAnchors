describe how indirect interactions derived model underlying biochemical reaction network using weak time-scale assumptions combination sensitivity criteria metabolic control analysis
apply approach model carbon assimilation network escherichia coli
our results show derived gene regulatory network densely connected contrary what usually assumed
moreover network largely sign-determined meaning signs indirect interactions fixed flux directions biochemical reactions independently specific parameter values rate laws
inversion fluxes following change growth conditions may affect signs indirect interactions though

 introduction 
adaptation bacteria changes their environment involves adjustments expression genes coding enzymes regulators membrane transporters etc
adjustments controlled gene regulatory networks ensuring coordinated expression clusters functionally related genes
interactions network may direct case gene coding transcription factor regulating expression another gene
most time however regulatory interactions indirect e.g when gene encodes enzyme producing transcriptional effector 
gene regulatory network thus not reduced its transcriptional regulatory interactions: ignoring indirect interactions mediated metabolic signaling pathways may miss crucial feedback loops system
network controlling carbon uptake bacterium escherichia coli good example because integrates metabolism signal transduction gene expression
at level gene expression network includes intricate feedback loops arise indirect interactions between subsystems
global regulators like crp control expression enzymes carbon metabolism while intermediates latter pathways control expression global regulators
instance phosphorylation eiia activates adenylate cyclase produce camp required activation crp

analysis derived gene regulatory network leads three new insights
first contrary what often assumed network densely connected due numerous feedback loops resulting indirect interactions
additional complexity important issue correct interpretation data genome-wide transcriptome studies
second derived gene regulatory network carbon assimilation e coli sign-determined sense signs interactions essentially fixed weak information flux directions biochemical reactions without explicit specification kinetic rate laws parameter values
therefore feedback structure robust changes kinetic properties enzymes other biochemical reactions species
third change environmental conditions may invert fluxes thus signs indirect interactions resulting dynamic rewiring regulatory network
