thus there need computational methods evaluate hypothesized cis regulatory codes before difficult task experimental verification undertaken
developed novel computational framework integrates transcription factor binding site gene expression information evaluate whether hypothesized transcriptional regulatory model likely target given set co-expressed genes
our basic approach simultaneously predict cis regulatory modules associated given gene set quantify enrichment combinatorial subsets transcription factor binding site motifs comprising hypothesized trm within predicted crms
model system examined trm experimentally demonstrated drive expression two genes sub-population cells developing drosophila mesoderm somatic muscle founder cells
trm was previously hypothesized general mode regulation genes expressed cell population
contrast present analyses suggest modified form cis regulatory code applies only subset founder cell genes those whose gene expression responds specific genetic perturbations similar manner gene original model was based
confirmed hypothesis experimentally discovering six new crms driving expression embryonic mesoderm four drive expression founder cells
 introduction 
central challenge determining structure genetic regulatory networks development systematic methods assessing whether set transcription factors co-regulates given set co-expressed genes
although classical genetics approaches allow identification key regulating tfs determination their approximate ordering within genetic hierarchy demonstrating collection tfs forms combinatorial code acting directly drive gene expression required laborious experimental identification perturbation numerous individual cis regulatory modules
speed process several groups recently demonstrated computational approaches rapidly identify crms considerable accuracy especially when performing computational searches collection tfs known priori co-regulate
perhaps best exemplified dramatic progress made several groups discovering crms genes expressed during segmentation drosophila melanogaster embryo system where years genetic screens identified regulating tfs
most biological systems however set co-regulating tfs either merely hypothesized entirely unknown
therefore order silico approaches effectively identify cis component regulation novel biological systems additional computational methods needed identify trans component regulation 
address question metazoan systems developed initial statistical framework evaluating hypothesized transcriptional regulatory models
model system examined regulation class drosophila myoblast genes regulatory model been previously hypothesized extensive transcriptional profiling datasets been generated
muscle founder cells sub-population mononucleate myoblasts specified wingless decapentaplegic ras signal transduction cascades acting combination within somatic mesoderm
prior experimental work using gene even-skipped mark single fc each embryonic hemisegment provided detailed model integration three signaling pathways at transcriptional level: tfs activated wg dpp ras pathways t cell factor mothers against dpp pointed respectively were demonstrated bind transcriptional enhancer driving expression eve within dorsal fcs
additional tissue specificity was shown provided two mesodermal selector tfs twist tinman
thus single enhancer combinatorial model transcriptional regulation genes expressed fcs was hypothesized where exogenous signaling cues endogenous tissue-specific tfs jointly establish appropriate expression domain
guided genetic analysis eve expression series gene expression profiles been determined purified embryonic myoblasts estrada et al
addition profiling wild-type cells investigators performed expression array analyses myoblasts wg dpp ras notch pathways were variably perturbed 12 informative gain-of-function loss-of-function genetic manipulations
each 12 genetic perturbations was predicted based example eve increase decrease expression those genes localized expression fcs
12 expression arrays were then combined into single weighted ranking was used predict additional fc genes
estrada et al performed over 200 situ hybridizations predicted fc genes top composite fc ordering their experiments yielded list 159 validated fc genes
present work utilize expression data estrada et al evaluate roles dtcf/mad/pnt/twi/tin generalized regulators fc gene expression
previous computational scan windows sequence containing five tfs successfully identified additional enhancer gene heartbroken drove expression dorsal fcs contained matches five transcription factor binding site motifs demonstrating example eve was not unique
however generality model could not established those two examples alone therefore developed method quantifying enrichment five tfbs motifs localized windows non-coding sequences flanking intronic fc genes
importantly approach term codefinder quantifies relevance not only each tf individually but also all combinations given set tfs
analysis hypothesized eve trm unlikely apply all fc genes
rather found three tfs pnt twi tin likely regulate specific subset fc genes share characteristic changes their gene expression profiles response genetic perturbations used estrada et al
thus combining tfbs gene expression data our analysis allows refinement initial model subset original tfs appears regulate subset fc genes
test hypothesis empirically validated four candidate fc enhancers conform our modified trm
