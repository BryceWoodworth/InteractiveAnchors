nematode caenorhabditis elegans provides exciting opportunity approach question large-scale quantitative manner
its synaptic connectivity network been identified combined cellular studies currently characteristic connectivity gene expression signatures most its neurons
using two complementary analysis assays show expression signature neuron carries significant information about its synaptic connectivity signature identify list putative genes predicting neural connectivity
current study rigorously quantifies relation between gene expression synaptic connectivity signatures c elegans nervous system identifies subsets neurons where relation highly marked
results presented genes identified provide promising starting point further more detailed computational experimental investigations
 introduction 
accepted common notion genes play major role formation nervous system; they specify neuronal cell types help destine neurons into defined neural circuits provide important cues determining their communication
many studies identified specific genes nematode c elegans disrupt development neural circuits
genes typically responsible neuronal morphology axon development synaptogenesis
findings include e.g axon guidance genes attractive repulsive interactions presynaptic input modulation presynaptic differentiation synaptic specificity genes
findings been based specifically targeted studies each designed address specific pathway neuron type receptor transmitter
yet been difficult identify large scale mutations determine specific identity synaptic connections mainly because synaptic specification one last steps complex process neuronal differentiation axonal migration
sieburth et al presented first large-scale screening genes involved c elegans neuromuscular junction
study identified more than 100 novel genes specific functions transmission signals across junction
while latter study was not aimed at identifying synaptic connectivity genes demonstrated plausibility addressing questions large-scale manner
recent related study varadan et al applied entropy minimization approach c elegans' data identify sets synergistically interacting genes whose joint expression common most synapses predicts neural connectivity leaving aside specific identity pre post-neurons
our study differs theirs both its goals its methods
leads first quantitative characterization relation between genetic properties neurons their synaptic connectivity concomitantly addressing majority c elegans neurons at large
existing c elegans neural wiring diagram provides connectivity signature each neuron specifying other neurons connected
each neuron also expression signature extracted wormbase specifying genes directly associated
combined together data enables investigation relation between expression connectivity signatures across most c elegans neurons
specifically address two attributes relation: first asks whether possible predict neuron's connectivity signature based solely its expression signature
second question what extent do neurons similar expression signatures similar connectivity signatures
show expression signatures neurons carry significant information about their connectivity signatures further identify specific genes play major role determining relation
gene sets identify do not necessarily direct causal influence synaptic connectivity specificity; however they provide putative gene targets further experimental investigation
finally suggest methodological way study relations between neurons' expression connectivity signatures their actual functional contribution behavior
quantifying relations allows addressing classical question neuroscience; what dominates functionality neural circuit local genetic basis individual neurons overall network structure determined their connectivity
