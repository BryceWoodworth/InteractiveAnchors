tested variety pore structures extracted molecular dynamics simulations based experimentally proposed octomeric pore structure
computed single-channel conductance values were range 290 680 ps
better agreement experimental range 40 360 ps was obtained using structures last 40 ns md simulation where conductance values range 280 430 ps
observed no significant variation conductance applied voltage any structures tested suggesting voltage dependence observed experimentally result voltage-dependent channel formation rather than inherent feature open pore structure
found pore highly selective anions anionic cationic current ratios order 10 3
consistent highly cationic nature pore but surprisingly disagreement experimental finding only slight anionic selectivity
additionally tested sensitivity our pnp model several parameters found ion diffusion coefficients significant influence conductance characteristics
best agreement experimental data was obtained using diffusion coefficient each ion set 10 percent bulk literature value everywhere inside channel scaling used several other studies employing pnp calculations

 introduction 
antimicrobial peptides small proteins produced innate immune system many plants animals first line defense against bacterial infections
due their persistence nature well their nonspecific mechanism action there been significant research activity aimed at designing novel antibiotics based amps ; expectation bacteria will not develop significant resistance antibiotics designed based peptides
thus far drug design efforts been largely hampered lack understanding fundamental mechanism action amps
although recent evidence suggests intracellular targets may play important role action many amps there strong body evidence suggesting ability peptides interact disrupt bacterial membrane essential their mechanism action
amps various structural classes been shown significant disruptive effects both living bacterial membranes model membrane systems lipid bilayers lipid monolayers
thorough reviews several proposed mechanisms membrane disruption reader referred
most relevant present work model amps aggregate form large nonselective pores bacterial membrane result uncontrolled ion leakage decay transmembrane potential uncontrolled water transport loss cell contents ultimately cell death
focused our efforts protegrin-1 particularly potent antimicrobial peptide recently been shown form pores lipid bilayers certain compositions
protegrins small peptides isolated porcine leukocytes exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against broad range both gram-positive gram-negative bacteria
protegrins characterized hairpin conformation held together two cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds
they contain 16 18 amino acids typically highly cationic positive charges arising arginine residues at hairpin turn region two termini
present work focus most prevalent natural form protegrin designated pg-1 amino acid sequence rggrlcycrrrfcvcvgr-nh 2
mani coworkers conducted solid-state nmr experiments investigate membrane-bound structure pg-1 peptide concluded peptide likely forms octomeric pores lipid bilayers composed 3 1 mixture palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol

prior studies pore structure protegrin early evidence protegrin pores was provided experiments mangoni coworkers sokolov coworkers conductance characteristics protegrin-treated membranes were measured
knowledge nonequlibrium ion flow through protegrin pores may closely related their mechanism action since unrestricted flow ions through membrane could result potentially lethal membrane depolarization
mangoni coworkers conducted voltage clamp experiments xenopus laevis oocyte membranes treated protegrin-1 several analogues
they found protegrins form weakly anion selective pores presence several different salts kcl solutions exhibiting almost no selectivity
furthermore they found conductance pores does not exhibit any voltage dependence over voltage range 100 30 mv
sokolov coworkers carried out conductance measurements across several different types planar phospholipid bilayers treated protegrin-1 well protegrin-3
authors found both protegrin analogues form weakly anion selective channels mixed phospholipid bilayers moderately cation-selective channels bilayers containing negatively charged bacterial lipopolysaccharide
they reported voltage-dependent single-channel conductance range 40 360 picosiemens depending peptide used lipid bilayer composition applied voltage
present work attempt explain quantify conductance behaviour protegrin pores terms structural information nmr experiments molecular dynamics simulations
particular explore connection between structural features size pore opening magnitude conductance well surprising experimental finding both mangoni coworkers sokolov coworkers protegrin pore only slightly anion selective despite having total charge 56
