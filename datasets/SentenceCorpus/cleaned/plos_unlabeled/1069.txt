tf modifications reversible phosphorylation missense mutations act independent tf expression level overlooked differential expression analysis
using bovine piedmontese myostatin mutants proof-of-concept propose new algorithm correctly identifies gene containing causal mutation microarray data alone
myostatin mutation releases brakes piedmontese muscle growth translating dysfunctional protein
compared less muscular non-mutant breed find myostatin not differentially expressed at any ten developmental time points
despite challenge algorithm identifies myostatin smoking gun through coordinated simultaneous weighted integration three sources microarray information: transcript abundance differential expression differential wiring
asking novel question regulator cumulatively most differentially wired abundant most differentially expressed genes
yields correct answer myostatin
our new approach identifies causal regulatory changes globally contrasting co-expression network dynamics
entirely data-driven weighting procedure emphasises regulatory movement relative phenotypically relevant part network
contrast other published methods compare co-expression networks significance testing not used eliminate connections
 introduction 
evolution normal development immune responses aberrant processes diseases cancer all involve at least some rewiring regulatory circuits
indeed subtle differences circuit wiring makes each individual unique
key nodes regulatory circuits frequently transcription factors
thus there great deal interest developing methods decoding tf changes
regulator-target interactions assessed chip-on-chip but requires large amounts homogenous starting material tf-specific reagents
furthermore recruitment tf promoter does not necessarily correlate transcriptional status so biological interpretation complex
likely sites key regulatory mutations revealed whole genome scans but approach requires large numbers individuals very dense snp panels
even so exact causal gene may remain ambiguous if there several genes near marker
any case little insight gained into underlying regulatory mechanisms
order gain further insights into regulatory apparatus computational approaches continuously being proposed
date they all operate integrating information multiple levels biological organisation particularly eqtl protein-protein interaction tf binding site data 
identifying regulatory change solely through contrasts gene expression data been elusive because tf tend stably expressed at baseline levels close sensitivity standard high-throughput expression profiling platforms
further tf activation often regulated post-translationally thereby act somewhat independently expression level
biologically important common tf activation processes poorly detected conventional differential expression analysis
hypothesised system-wide network approach might utility grounds while differentially-regulated tf might not de between two systems its new position network perturbed system might allow detection smoking gun
allow reliable evaluation hypothesis well-defined experimental model system required
piedmontese cattle double-muscled because they possess genomic dna mutation myostatin mrna transcript
resulting dysfunctional myostatin protein transcriptional regulator releases brakes muscle growth reflecting importance tgf signalling pathways determination final muscle mass fibre composition
preliminary analysis expression myostatin piedmontese hereford versus wagyu hereford animals found de myostatin was not detectable using cdna-based expression microarrays 
thus system know identity gene containing causal mutation myostatin but cannot identify de mrna muscle samples
contrasting muscle transcriptomes piedmontese wagyu crosses across 10 developmental time points our aim was establish question myostatin answer
other words what question do need ask gene expression data reveal identity transcriptional regulator containing causal mutation
