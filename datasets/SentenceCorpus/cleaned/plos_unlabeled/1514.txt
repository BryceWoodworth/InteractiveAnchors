 introduction 
despite huge efforts improve public health spread infectious diseases still ubiquitous at beginning 21st century there considerable variability epidemic patterns between locations
although recent influenza pandemic been global challenge there nonetheless been differences its timing northern southern hemisphere due seasonal effects
another prominent example epidemic variability prevalence sexually transmitted diseases specifically hiv infections
although hiv endemic many populations at low levels restricted high-risk groups become highly endemic other parts world
consequence spread infectious diseases cannot understood globally but understood only result several local factors climate hygiene conditions population density structure cultural habits mobility
epidemic models aim capture mechanisms link factors emergent epidemics promote understanding underlying dynamic processes prerequisite intervention strategies
useful abstraction context regard individuals may infected nodes network links potentially infectious contacts among individuals
major remaining challenge modern epidemiology link variability transmission networks corresponding emergent epidemics
models flexible adapted specific epidemic situations best meet challenges
because focus interplay between transmission network topology epidemics will restrict ourselves diseases caused agents lead either immunity death their host i.e infection occur only once
epidemics described susceptible-infected-recovered sir models
refer mathematically closely related case where infection eventually leads death host sid model
original classical sir model assumes mass-action type dynamic consequence describes epidemics homogeneous well-mixed populations
because generally not good approximation real world situations current epidemic models strive integrated approach considers both information about course disease relevant transmission network
models vary their assumptions attention detail computational costs consequence their fields application
compartmental sir models consider different contact patterns sub-populations link them via contact matrix providing coarse-grained but often adequate representation
network-based sir models consider distribution each individual's number infectious contacts formula transmission network
models allow study transmission networks strong heterogeneity number contacts among individuals some cases also means they consider correlations way contacts made clustering
although approaches focus static networks recent approach considers networks arbitrary degree distributions transient contacts allows derivation temporal evolution number susceptible infected nodes closed set equations
finally pair models very general approach studying sir epidemics heterogeneous networks
they provide large amount flexibility considering way contacts made maintained but trade-off they quickly become very computationally demanding 
assumption often implicitly made epidemic models epidemic sweeps through population at much shorter time scales than time scale background demographic processes i.e natural birth death processes neglected
good approximation cases yearly influenza epidemics but hardly adequate hiv epidemics span decades
compensate limitation integrated demographic background processes into recent network epidemic models
hiv mind case study focus disease epidemics lead death after infection susceptible individuals possibly after undergoing several stages disease
addition earlier work our approach also allows depth study interplay between epidemic spreading structure dynamics underlying transmission network
strictly speaking all approaches discussed only predict mean behavior epidemics within limit infinite host population
however our comparisons finite size agent-based simulations show good computationally efficient approximation already moderate population sizes
