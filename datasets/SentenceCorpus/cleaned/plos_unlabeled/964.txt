 
individual perception vaccine safety important factor determining person's adherence vaccination program its consequences disease control
perception belief about safety given vaccine not static parameter but variable subject environmental influence
complicate matters perception risk does not correspond actual risk
paper propose way include dynamics beliefs into realistic epidemiological model yielding more complete depiction mechanisms underlying unraveling vaccination campaigns
methodology proposed based bayesian inference extended model more complex belief systems associated decision models
found method able produce behaviors approximate what been observed real vaccine disease scare situations
framework presented comprises set useful tools adequate quantitative representation common yet complex public-health issue
tools include representation beliefs bayesian probabilities usage logarithmic pooling combine probability distributions representing opinions usage natural conjugate priors efficiently compute bayesian posterior
approach allowed comprehensive treatment uncertainty regarding vaccination behavior realistic epidemiological model
 introduction 
since early vaccination campaigns against smallpox vaccination policies been matter debate : mass vaccination versus blocking strategies; compulsory versus voluntary some highly debated issues
despite early controversies  consequent alternative policies implemented different countries  high disease scare past led very high vaccine coverage consequent successful eradication smallpox well very low incidence measles polio tetanus diphtheria etc resulting over 98 percent mortality reduction vaccine preventable diseases developed countries 
recent years after complete almost complete elimination diseases debate shifting towards issues vaccine safety
increased perception vaccine risks lowered perception disease risks challenged previous willingness vaccinate
scenario understanding predicting individual's willingness vaccinate paramount estimating vaccine coverage compare strategies achieve coverage goals
willingness vaccinate highly dependent perceived risk acquiring serious disease
when disease risk low however small risk adverse events vaccine become relatively important may lead vaccine coverage lower than required control transmission
when serious disease risk too high other hand vaccine coverage may increase above required guarantee population protection
illustrate behaviors two examples:
uk mmr vaccine uptake started decline after controversial study linking mmr vaccine autism
decade vaccine coverage went well below target herd immunity level 95 percent
despite confidence researchers most health professionals vaccine safety confidence public was deeply affected
attempt find ways restore confidence several studies were carried out identify factors associated parent's unwillingness vaccinate their children
they found not receiving unbiased adequate information health professionals about vaccine safety media's adverse publicity were most common reasons influencing uptake
other important factors were: lack belief information government sources ; fear general practitioners promoting vaccine personal reasons ; media scare
note during period risk acquiring measles was very low due previously high vaccination coverage
