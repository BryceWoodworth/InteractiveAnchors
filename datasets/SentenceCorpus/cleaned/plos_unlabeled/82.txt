illustrate hypothesis present neural network model comprising set interconnected structures harboring stimulus-related activity group executive units task-related activity patterns manage information flowing between them

 introduction 
important unanswered question neurobiology how neural activity organizes itself produce coherent behavior
lesion electrophysiological imaging studies targeting specific cognitive functions provided very detailed insights into how different regions brain contribute behavior
more specifically they shown role various regions cortex implementing functions visual representation stimuli sustainment memory stimulus representation tasks rules selection response among set possibilities shielding memory distractions planning movements
however remains unclear how different regions cortex interact together build even simplest behavior
indeed even elementary action looking at object preparing reach requires cascade neural processes take place right order proper timing successful
here propose adequate behavior generated set functions mentioned above if information cortical regions contain exchange each other managed executive control structures manner suiting task at hand
brain-scale activity coding integrated behavior might then constructed executive units repertoire simple neurocognitive functions would selected recruited ordered synchronized implement necessary neural computations
illustrate hypothesis present neural network model able pass mixed-delayed response task was introduced study memory retrieval monkey using visual associations
task consists randomly mixed delayed-matching sample delayed-pair association trials require subject either maintain memory image during delay remember image associated respectively
type trial performed signaled subject during delay
network contains structures harboring image-related activities each them implementing one elementary functions crucial task execution: visual representation working memory planning memory
areas complemented executive units control activity held layers regulate information flow between them
neural computations necessary perform tasks encoded firing patterns control units coordinated depend strongly both trial type phase trial
resulting dynamics allows network trained dms then dpa task while reproducing electrophysiological data gathered inferior temporal prefrontal cortices monkeys performing similar tasks
