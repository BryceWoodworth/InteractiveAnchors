 
protein folding dynamics often described diffusion free energy surface considered function one few reaction coordinates
however growing number experiments models show when projected onto reaction coordinate protein dynamics sub-diffusive
raises question whether conventionally used diffusive description dynamics adequate
here numerically construct optimum reaction coordinate long equilibrium folding trajectory go model formula-repressor protein
trajectory projected onto coordinate exhibits diffusive dynamics while dynamics same trajectory projected onto sub-optimal reaction coordinate sub-diffusive
show higher free energy profile putative reaction coordinate more diffusive dynamics become when projected coordinate
results suggest whether projected dynamics diffusive sub-diffusive depends chosen reaction coordinate
protein folding described diffusion free energy surface function optimum reaction coordinate
conversely conventional reaction coordinates even though they might based physical intuition often sub-optimal hence show sub-diffusive dynamics
 introduction 
free energy surface projected onto one small number coordinates often used describe equilibrium kinetic properties complex systems very large number degrees freedom
studies protein folding important case where type projected surface been introduced coordinates number native contacts radius gyration been used
protein folding then described diffusion projected free energy surface
diffusive dynamics characterized means square displacement linearly growing time formula where d diffusion coefficient
single reaction coordinate diffusive dynamics completely specified free energy profile i.e free energy function coordinate coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient conveniently computed conventional cut based free energy profiles
construction good reaction coordinate challenging
many cases standard progress variables not good reaction coordinates because they do not preserve barriers fes thus may mask inherent complexity latter
number methods construct good reaction coordinates been suggested 
employing mori-zwanzig formalism one derive generalized langevin equations describe system dynamics projected reaction coordinates
generalized langevin equation contains memory kernel leads non-markovian dynamics subdiffusion
subdiffusion characterized mean square displacement growing slower than diffusion formula exponent formula
completely specify dynamics case one compute memory kernel not trivial since requires solution multidimensional partial differential equation
long-term memory correlation functions anomalous diffusion proteins was observed experimentally theoretically
raises question whether folding dynamics proteins described simple diffusion projected free energy surface often done if one use more sophisticated descriptions e.g generalized langevin equations fractional fokker-plank equations multiscale state space networks
here show if reaction coordinate properly optimized then dynamics projected onto coordinate diffusive while same dynamics projected onto sub-optimal coordinate sub-diffusive
