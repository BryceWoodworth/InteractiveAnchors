tortuosity path traced during behavior implies almost concurrent multiple views environment

 introduction 
when introduced into novel environment rats establish preferred place characterized highest frequency visits highest cumulative dwell time upper bound number stops per roundtrip performed low outbound trajectory speed high inbound trajectory speed speed relationship reversed later stages session
existence highly organized behavior across whole arena reference so-called home base illustrates influence preferred place might overall organization exploratory behavior prompts search other types preferred places may similar influence organization exploratory behavior
contrast situation rats there ambiguity regarding establishment home bases mice: while some studies mention home bases their establishment mostly low occurrence forced exploration setup
even though mice readily establish home bases near physical objects near nesting material they reported fail establish distinct home bases during forced exploration relatively featureless environment 
when mice used control group another study were injected saline placed exposed portion large open field arena they established preferred places typically not more than one per session they visited sporadically tracing them tortuous path full twists turns bends looked like knot
termed places knots behavior performed them  knot-scribbling
knot phenomenon appeared its full blown form saline-injected mice was subsequently uncovered albeit less striking form also intact mice
present study describe full-blown knot phenomenon saline-injected mice only then verify existence knots intact mice
uncover knots utilize basic feature locomotor path its curvature
depending size window used measuring path curvature measure discloses various features path texture overall large-scale curvature fine-grained tortuosity
present study use window size makes fine-grained tortuosity path conspicuous possible
curvature been measured previously only cumulative measure paths without coupling particular degree curvature particular topographical locations
uncover knots first calculate fine-grained path curvature each data point path traced mouse
then partition arena into small 5 5cm unit areas summate each unit area curvature path included within unit area
magnitude path curvature per unit area then color coded visualization paths thus highlighting unit areas marked highest curvature
having uncovered high curvature locale then design use algorithms define its boundaries quantify some its features
finally ask whether knots discover also endowed classical home base features consider their function
