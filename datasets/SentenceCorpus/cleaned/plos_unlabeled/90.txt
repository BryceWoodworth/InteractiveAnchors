 
many proteins especially eukaryotes contain tandem repeats several domains same family
repeats variety binding properties involved protein protein interactions well binding other ligands dna rna
rapid expansion protein domain repeats assumed evolved through internal tandem duplications
however exact mechanisms behind tandem duplications not well-understood
here studied evolution function protein structure gene structure phylogenetic distribution domain repeats
purpose assigned pfam-a domain families 24 proteomes more sensitive domain assignments repeat regions
assignments confirmed previous findings eukaryotes particular vertebrates contain much higher fraction proteins repeats compared prokaryotes
internal sequence similarity each protein revealed domain repeats often expanded through duplications several domains at time while duplication one domain less common
many repeats appear been duplicated middle repeat region
strong contrast evolution other proteins mainly works through additions single domains at either terminus
further found some domain families show distinct duplication patterns e.g nebulin domains mainly been expanded unit seven domains at time while duplications other domain families involve varying numbers domains
finally no common mechanism expansion all repeats could detected
found duplication patterns show no dependence size domains
further repeat expansion some families possibly explained shuffling exons
however exon shuffling could not created all repeats
 introduction 
proteins composed domains recurrent protein fragments distinct structure function evolutionary history
protein domains may occur alone but more frequently found combination other domains multidomain proteins
while creation new multidomain architectures through shuffling protein domains been studied extensively during last few years one type domain recombination often been ignored: creation domain repeats
domain repeats contain two more domains same domain family tandem
large repeats more then ten domains tandem common eukaryotes
repeating domains often short leucine rich repeat family repeating unit 30 residues
some repeated domain families mainly found repeats e.g lrr c2h2 zinc fingers while other families also frequently found single unit
repeats may form regular structures antiparallel sheets solenoids while others form filaments only structured upon binding their ligands
some examples repeats protein structures found propeat database
single amino acids short peptide motifs may repeated proteins too
however study focused larger repeating units domains
therefore when repeats mentioned text refers repeats protein domains
domain repeats often involved interactions proteins other ligands dna rna
even if repeated domains well-defined conserved structure sequence conservation often low only few conserved residues required correct fold
their variable sequences variation number domains provide flexible binding multiple binding partners
hence repeats found proteins highly diverse functions tetratrico peptide repeats involved cell-cycle regulation transcriptional regulation protein transport assisting protein folding
addition flexible binding properties sequence variability repeats been exploited create high affinity binders alternative antibodies 
domain repeats found all kingdoms life long repeats containing several domains tandem been observed particularly common multicellular species
repeats been proposed provide eukaryotes extra source variability compensate low generation rates
one example lrrs plant defense systems enable plants adapt new pathogens 
domain repeats thought arise via tandem duplications within gene where segment duplicated copy inserted next its origin
however exact mechanism behind phenomenon not fully understood
nonhomologous recombination intron regions i.e exon shuffling may responsible internal duplications repeats issue been addressed study
another possible explanation dna slippage due formation dna hairpins common creation nucleotide repeats short protein repeats
however marcotte coworkers shown protein repeats more likely created recombination than dna slippage since repeat expansion shows weak dependence repeat length 
addition internal duplications frequent duplications repeat-containing genes occurred mammalian genomes
part explain their abundance higher eukaryotes
addition variation number repeats between orthologous genes indicates loss/gain domains repeats frequent evolution
interestingly rapid expansion repeats eukaryotes could partly explained tandem duplication units containing several repeated domains
study aim investigate how frequent duplications multiple domains
further number domains duplicated compared among different domain families
domains defined pfam-a database were detected using hmm-alignments
coverage was increased relaxed detection criteria domains repeated regions proteins
addition investigation duplication sizes domain assignments been used study distribution repeats repeated domain families three kingdoms life position repeat expansion location exon boundaries repeats
