 introduction 
many proteins molecular machines
they function because their three-dimensional structure allows them undergo cooperative changes conformation maintain native fold while enabling their biological functions
changes been pointed out structure-encoded intrinsically accessible proteins deduced simple physics-based approaches
yet amino acid specificity another important property selectively mediates interactions specific partners ligands
overall subtle balance exists between structure-encoded mechanical properties sequence-encoded specific properties balance must evolutionarily optimized achieve precise functioning
interplay between two effects becomes particularly important case number proteins domains play modular role variety biomolecular interactions
atpase domain hsp70 family proteins typical example
domain plays critical role regulating activities molecular chaperones turn promote accurate folding prevent unwanted aggregation either unfolding refolding misfolded proteins regulating their intracellular trafficking protein degradation machinery 
chaperones hsp70 family contain two domains: n-terminal atpase domain c-terminal substrate-binding domain regulate each other's activity via allosteric effects
atp hydrolysis at atpase domain increases substrate-binding affinity sbd thus lowering substrate exchange rate; other hand dissociation adp produced upon atp hydrolysis its replacement new atp trigger release substrate sbd therefore enhance substrate exchange rate
regulation substrate-binding affinity atpase domain forms basis chaperone activity hsp70s 
precise functioning hsp70 atpase domain involves interaction two families co-factors also called co-chaperones: j-domain proteins catalyze atp hydrolysis nucleotide exchange factors assist replacement adp atp significantly increasing adp dissociation rate
