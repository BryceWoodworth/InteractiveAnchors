 
many protein functions directly linked conformational changes
inside cells equilibria transition rates between different conformations may affected macromolecular crowding
recently developed new approach modeling crowding effects enables atomistic representation test proteins
here approach applied study how crowding affects equilibria transition rates between open closed conformations seven proteins: yeast protein disulfide isomerase adenylate kinase orotidine phosphate decarboxylase trp repressor hemoglobin dna glucosyltransferase ap 4a hydrolase
each protein molecular dynamics simulations open closed states separately run
representative open closed conformations then used calculate crowding-induced changes chemical potential two states
difference chemical-potential change between two states finally predicts effects crowding population ratio two states
crowding found reduce open population various extents
presence crowders 15 radius occupying 35 percent volume open-to-closed population ratios ypdi adk odcase trpr reduced 79 percent 78 percent 62 percent 55 percent respectively
reductions remaining three proteins 20 44 percent
expected four proteins experiencing stronger crowding effects those larger conformational changes between open closed states
larger proteins also tend experience stronger crowding effects than smaller ones e.g comparing ypdi trpr
potentials mean force along open-closed reaction coordinate apo ligand-bound odcase altered crowding suggesting transition rates also affected
quantitative results qualitative trends will serve valuable guides expected crowding effects protein conformation changes inside cells
 introduction 
increasingly recognized protein dynamics serves critical link between structure function
important manifestation protein dynamics sampling alternative conformations
conformational changes triggered substrate binding post-translational modifications phosphorylation
increasingly structures same proteins at different functional states becoming available
structures provide atomistic details conformational changes
example adenylate kinase enzyme catalyzes phosphoryl transfer atp amp undergoes significant conformational transition open conformation apo form closed conformation ligand-bound form
main differences between two conformations occur atp amp-binding domains core domain relatively rigid
other examples well-characterized conformational transitions include proteins responsible signal transduction across cell membranes ion channels 
biophysical characterizations protein conformational changes mostly been carried out under dilute conditions
however environments where proteins perform their biological functions i.e extracellular space cell membrane cytoplasm crowded macromolecules
example cytoplasm escherichia coli contains about 300 400 g/l macromolecules estimated occupy over 30 percent total volume
cell membranes membrane proteins occupy similar level total surface area
how crowded cellular environments affect equilibria transition rates between different conformations proteins still poorly understood
qualitatively one expects macromolecular crowding will significantly modify energy landscapes conformational changes favoring more compact structures over more open ones
effects crowding been scrutinized experimentally
molecular dynamics simulations also been carried out investigate energy landscapes number proteins under crowding context either conformational change folding-unfolding transition
speed up conformational sampling proteins studies were represented at coarse-grained level
recently developed approach referred postprocessing opens door atomistic modeling proteins under crowding
approach motions test protein simulated absence crowders
conformations simulation then used calculate change chemical potential if they transferred crowded solution
dependence change chemical potential reaction coordinates then captures influence crowding energy landscape
postprocessing approach been applied study effects crowding protein folding binding stability open-closed equilibrium hiv-1 protease dimer
latter application been shown postprocessing approach yields results identical those obtained direct simulations protein presence crowders 
here apply postprocessing approach investigate impact macromolecular crowding open-closed equilibria seven proteins: adk yeast protein disulfide isomerase orotidine phosphate decarboxylase trp repressor hemoglobin dna glucosyltransferase ap 4a hydrolase
biological functions subcellular locations proteins listed table 1
find crowding reduce open-to-closed population ratios various extents; potentials mean force along open-closed reaction coordinate apo ligand-bound odcase hence transition rates similarly affected
