 introduction 
post-genome era crucial uncover underlying mechanism cellular networks understand their biological function
underlying nature cellular networks been explored genetic techniques
cellular networks been found generally quite robust perform their biological functions against environmental perturbations
there increasing numbers studies global topological structures networks recently scale-free properties hierarchical architectures networks been found
hubs highly connected nodes network essential keeping network together might play important role robustness network
however there so far very few studies why network should robust perform biological function physical point view 
theoretical models cellular networks often been formulated set chemical rate equations
dynamical descriptions inherently local
probe global properties one often change parameters
parameter space huge
global robustness therefore hard see approach
here will explore nature networks another angle formulate problem terms potential function potential energy landscape
if potential energy landscape cellular network known global properties explored
analogy fact global thermodynamic properties explored when knowing inherent interaction potentials system
set normal chemical rate equations describing cellular networks f x being concentrations proteins f being chemical reaction rate flux one cannot general write right-hand side equations gradient potential energy function
however typical chemical reaction network equations only approximations average concentration level
cell statistical fluctuations coming finite number molecules provide source intrinsic internal noise fluctuations highly dynamical inhomogeneous environments interior cell provide source external noise networks
both internal external noise play important roles determining properties network
general one should study chemical reaction network equations noisy conditions model cellular environments more realistically
one also study steady-state properties chemical reaction equation networks under noisy environments
generalized potential steady state network exists general
once network problem formulated terms generalized potential energy function potential energy landscape issue global stability robustness much easier address
fact purpose paper study global robustness problem directly properties potential landscape network
explore nature underlying potential landscape cellular networks will study yeast cell-cycle network
one most important functions cell reproduction growth
therefore crucial understand cell cycle its underlying process
cell cycles during development usually divided into several phases: g0/g1 s g2 m phases
most eukaryotic cells elaborate control mechanisms over dna synthesis mitosis make sure crucial events cell cycle carried out properly precisely
physiologically there usually three checkpoints controlling coordination: g0/g1 before new round division g2 before mitotic process begins m before segregation
recently many underlying controlling mechanisms revealed genetic techniques mutations gene knockouts
been found control been centered around cyclin-dependent protein kinases trigger major events eukaryotic cell cycle
example activation cyclin/cdk dimer drives cells at both g1 g2 checkpoints further progress
during other phases checkpoints cdk/cyclin activated
although molecular interactions regulating cdk activities known mechanisms checkpoint controls still uncertain 
figure 1 coarse-grained relationship between cyclin cdc2 cell cycle illustrated
step 1 cyclin synthesized de novo
newly synthesized cyclin may unstable
cyclin combines cdc2-p form pre-mpf
at some point after heterodimer formation cyclin subunit phosphorylated
cdc2 subunit then dephosphorylated form active mpf
principle activation mpf may opposed protein kinase
nuclear division triggered when sufficient quantity mpf been activated but concurrently active mpf destroyed step 6
breakdown mpf complex releases phosphorylated cyclin subject rapid proteolysis
finally cdc2 subunit phosphorylated cycle repeats itself
mathematical models cell cycle controls been formulated set ordinary first-order differential equations mimicking underlying biochemical processes
models been applied budding yeast cycle explained many qualitative physiological behaviors
checkpoints viewed fixed points
since intracellular intercellular signal transduction induces changes regulatory networks cell cycle described mimicked dynamics out fixed points
although detailed simulations give some insights towards issues due limitation parameter space search difficult perceive global universal properties cycle networks
purpose current study address issue
will develop global energy landscape theory cell cycle network
statistical-based approach good two reasons
coarse-grained approach captures only most important factors so analysis carried out relatively easily revealing some global properties
other hand statistical approach very useful informative when data rapidly accumulating
picture there many possible states network corresponding different patterns activation inhibition protein states
each checkpoint viewed basin attractions globally low energy states
g0/g1 phase states should lowest global energy since end cycle
initiate new cycle network receive signal activate pump next phase proceed
dynamics cell cycle described dynamical motions landscape state space one basin another
kinetic search not entirely random but directed since random search takes cosmological time
direction gradient landscape provided tilting towards g0/g1 phase
landscape therefore becomes funneled towards g0/g1 state bottom funnel what call native state
at end g0/g1 phase network pumped high energy excited states at top funnel
cell cycle then follows cascades through configurational state space directed way passing several checkpoints finally reaching bottom funnel g0/g1 phase again before being pumped again another cycle
will study global stability exploring underlying potential landscape yeast cell-cycle network
aim paper provide framework tool study at cell network globally
at conclusion paper show potential landscape budding yeast cell cycle funneled robust against perturbation kinetic rates environmental disturbances through noise
