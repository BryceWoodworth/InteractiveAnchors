nutrition research investigates processes living organism receives utilizes materials necessary maintenance life health
traditionally nutritional research investigates processes at level whole organism
thermodynamic viewpoint all living organisms exist state far equilibrium
maintain state central importance harvest sufficient energy surroundings
energy comes controlled combustion macronutrients carbohydrate fat protein
overarching organizing principle expressed dynamic energy budget theory considers energy food extracted stored reserves distributed throughout body fuel processes essential life
processes include generation heat maintenance gradients across cell membranes production gametes synthesis structural mass establishment maturity somatic maintenance maturity maintenance
organization effectively decouples organism's internal energy external world facilitating homeostasis
principle clear relevance nutritional physiology
contrast dietary macronutrient energy sources dietary micronutrients notably mineral elements vitamins also play key role overall health organism
inadequate amounts some dietary micronutrients been demonstrated cause classic deficiency diseases scurvy beriberi anemia goiter cretinism
third class various essential nutrients exist used both energy harvesting synthesis structural mass well precursors specific bioactive compounds
nutrients include essential amino acids essential omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids
many health disorders not necessarily caused dietary deficiencies but more generally imbalances between intake utilization nutrients
while there general consensus proper nutrition prevent various chronic diseases understanding health effects specific nutritional compounds extraordinarily complicated
first delivery nutritional perturbation difficult control over long time periods perturbations often relatively subtle effects over time scales typically investigated
second very difficult unravel distinctive bioactivity nutritional compound interest when supplied background diet containing hundreds other bioactive components
third difficult assess bioavailability nutrient interest especially at level specific target organs cells
problem bioavailability at whole body level had long history mathematical modeling specifically trace elements
computational kinetic methods were introduced nutritional sciences along use stable isotopes where interpretation kinetic data required development appropriate mathematical models
typically compartmental modeling approaches used describe absorption distribution elimination nutrient
common most models high level aggregation where body adequately described only few compartments
together models aim provide rational basis determination nutritional requirements body understanding differences requirements different micronutrients
while traditional modeling methods been very useful real challenge modeling nutrition help understand rationally manipulate complex relationship between nutrition health determined integrated multiscale responses nutrients ranging whole body subcellular levels organization over time scales minutes years
difficulty apparent problems arise current efforts pinpoint precise role nutrition metabolic syndrome
at long time scale whole body level organization prolonged period consuming more energy than expended results gradual development obesity increases one's risk developing insulin resistance hallmark metabolic syndrome
study insulin resistance revealed function hormone at level organs tissues occurs time scale minutes hours
example insulin stimulation skeletal muscle glucose uptake inhibition hepatic glucose output inhibition adipose tissue lipolysis host other physiological effects occur time scale
methods developed unravel quantify molecular mechanisms underlying effects shown involvement complex intracellular signal transduction pathways changes gene expression modification enzyme kinetics intracellular molecular trafficking
furthermore production insulin pancreatic beta cells occurs response glucose amino acids modulated fatty acids all clearly influenced diet nutrition
unique electrophysiological properties beta cells influenced metabolism glucose fatty acids while electrical bursting oscillatory behavior coupled insulin secretion time scales seconds minutes
thus understanding how nutrition impacts mechanisms underlying insulin resistance requires quantitative analysis description multiscale highly coupled regulatory network includes thousands components ranging over subcellular whole body levels organization spanning time scales seconds years
although conceptual perspective outlined above derived literature without too much effort extremely difficult develop integrated quantitative understanding spans entire complexity mechanisms involved
principle mathematical models offer capability therefore required more fully understand physiological basis not only metabolic syndrome but role nutrition health disease general
without quantitative integrative approach inevitable one will get lost tangle bubbles arrows typical conceptual models find oneself unable weigh relative importance each component interaction determining overall physiological phenotype
field mathematical modeling nutrition very diverse presently no single mathematical formalism allows one generate required integrated quantitative understanding nutrition formulated above
therefore developing our vision what needed coming years now review several representative models successfully addressed key nutritional questions together may help point way more integrative modeling approach
first review modeling approaches processes at cellular level describing biochemical processes operate convert food ingredients into energy building blocks cell fundamental unit life
insight into processes teaches us how metabolism regulated at its most basic level
furthermore modeling at cellular level provides entry point considering vast quantity complexity omics data
second review use metabolic flux analysis framework quantitative analysis material fluxes within single cell well between different cell populations organs up whole body level
thus mfa forms natural bridge between different levels organization different time scales
thirdly review compartmental models lipoprotein metabolism because lipoproteins major mediators lipid trafficking between organs many processes linked lipids associated metabolic syndrome includes cardiovascular diseases obesity insulin resistance modern plagues industrialized societies
finally review mathematical models body weight composition regulation complex relationship macronutrient metabolism at whole body level
modeling at whole body physiological level demonstrates importance considering long time scales characteristic chronic diseases like obesity metabolic syndrome
course cannot cover all areas modeling field nutrition review
instance will not review models gut-associated processes nutrient absorption bacterial conversion nondigestible food components into important compounds short-chain fatty acids
another important area will not review models neuro-hormonal regulation food intake metabolism
nevertheless collection models chose review ensures cover process occurring vast space time spectrum nanometer meter microseconds years
therefore four areas modeling discuss provide sufficiently broad basis our goal namely review available computational approaches key answering central questions nutrition serve platform development more integrative systems models
