however due their conformational flexibility notoriously difficult uniquely determine their structure via traditional experimental techniques x-ray scattering nuclear magnetic resonance
result structures missing loops not uncommon protein data bank
sequence structure variability protein loops also presents major challenge homology modeling
moderate sequence identity good quality experimental template structures generally feasible obtain overall tertiary structure some acceptable degree detail loop question
however errors could significant loop regions where sequences between target template protein differ significantly
our view loop closure problem namely construction protein fragment closes gap between two fixed end points remains unsolved
satisfactory solution problem will not only benefit experimental structure determination comparative modeling but also useful de novo protein structure prediction phase space sampling importance local moves without changing rest system been repeatedly demonstrated chain molecules 
complete solution protein loop reconstruction problem usually involves two important components buildup loop structure selection most promising candidates through appropriate scoring function
current study addresses former problem
variety algorithms been developed tackle loop closure problem
many methods construct protein loops reusing representative loop blocks database experimentally determined protein structures
naturally methods highly dependent size quality experimental data their performance improved substantially rapid growth pdb
more importantly since number possible conformations increases exponentially length approach limited relatively short loops
not problem ab initio methods construct loops either distorting existing structures relaxing distorted non-physical structures molecular dynamics simulated annealing gradient minimization random tweaking discrete dihedral angle sampling self-consistent field optimization
algorithms often include energy calculations using classical force fields implicit explicit treatment solvent effects therefore tend computationally expensive
several groups combined knowledge-based sampling approaches sometimes considerable success

further supplemented external constraints derived experimental techniques 2d nmr fluorescent resonance energy transfer
taken together constraints greatly reduce search space needs sampled order identify loop's accessible conformations
distance geometry class methods aim specifically at generating conformations satisfy geometric constraints
dg attempts minimize error function measures violation geometric constraints
dg methods involve four basic steps: generating interatomic distance bounds assigning random value each distance within respective bounds converting resulting distance matrix into starting set cartesian coordinates refining coordinates minimizing distance constraint violations
ensure reasonable conformations generated original upper lower bounds usually refined using iterative triangular smoothing procedure
although process improves initial guess randomly chosen distances may still inconsistent valid 3-dimensional geometry necessitating expensive metrization schemes higher dimensional embeddings prior error refinement lengthy refinement procedures if random starting coordinates used
although dg methods generate sensible starting geometries geometries rather crude most practical applications need further refined some form energy minimization
since its first chemical applications 1978 crippen havel dg been applied wide range problems including nmr structure determination conformational analysis homology modeling ab initio fold prediction 
recently new self-organizing technique known stochastic proximity embedding been developed extremely attractive alternative conventional dg embedding procedures
