brix fragment database consisting fragments 4 14 residues long was realized through identification recurrent backbone fragments non-redundant set high-resolution protein structures
brix contains alphabet more than 1,000 frequently observed conformations per peptide length 6 different variation levels
analysis performance brix revealed average structural coverage protein structures more than 99 percent within root mean square distance 1 angstrom
globally able reconstruct protein structures average accuracy 0.48 angstrom rmsd
expected regular structures well covered but interestingly many loop regions appear irregular at first glance also found form recurrent structural motif albeit lower frequency occurrence than regular secondary structures
larger loop regions could completely reconstructed smaller recurrent elements between 4 8 residues long
finally observed significant amount short sequences tend display strong structural ambiguity between alpha helix extended conformations
when sequence length increases so-called sequence plasticity no longer observed illustrating context dependency polypeptide structures
 introduction 
high-resolution structure determination proteins protein complexes via experimental methods occurs at significantly slower pace than collection novel protein sequences
result less than 30 percent human proteins known structure protein data bank percentage other species significantly lower
addition structures mostly cover one small number protein domains thus covering only fraction total sequence protein
homology modeling improves coverage using related proteins known structures build model
construction adequate homolog divided into two related tasks: placement amino acid side chains given backbone template detection changes backbone conformations required accommodate new sequence
proteins relatively close terms sequence identity backbone-modeling problem usually ignored but many cases best homology template shows less than 50 percent homology target small compensatory changes backbone likely required obtain accurate model
recent advances protein backbone modeling based observation protein structures built finite repertoire structural folds
structural redundancy allowed classification protein folds scop database cath database fssp classification
unit fold classification usually protein domain since large proteins generally composed multiple domains
consequence classification comprises hierarchical organisation protein domains embodies evolutionary structural relationships
creating more categories thus refining secondary structure descriptions been proposed set discrete backbone conformational states derived
different research groups demonstrated usefulness fragment libraries when reconstructing protein structures generating sets protein decoys
latest editions casp prediction approaches assemble fragments known structures into candidate structure proven successful
fragment assembly methods assumption made local interactions create particular conformational bias but do not uniquely define local structure
instead environmental constraints will determine overall compact protein conformation
construction final model composed three steps: first step involves selection fragment candidates based their stability measured simplified scoring function
second step fragments assembled combinatorially
final step obtained structure optimized through employment force field
method works well small all class proteins reasonably well / all class proteins
fragment approach been successfully applied structure prediction algorithm rosetta baker co-workers also proved successful accurately designing new folds
publicly accessible libraries however limited; they typically small consider lengths between 4 7 residues
instance examining fragments 5 residues kolodny levitt created library 20 fragments while etchebest found only 16 building blocks length
alphabet camproux consists 27 structural classes based motives 4 residues
employing their hypercosine method set 150,000 length-7 protein fragments hunter subramaniam discovered 13 minimal centroids representative fragment shapes found proteins at resolution 0.80 angstrom
low resolution approaches restricted single fragment length thus resulting limited set building blocks might constitute advantage terms computational efficiency ab initio structure prediction methods will also lead significant loss information
wainreb et al made possible cluster variable sized fragments consisting at least 15 residues through implementation their ssgs algorithm
allowing more variability alignment loop locations they created library 8,933 building blocks
alternative approach implemented depristo et al uses ensemble artificially generated small polypeptide conformations instead sampling conformations known protein structures
constraining chemical properties idealized geometry phi/psi angles excluded volume they constructed ensembles near-native conformations consistent surrounding fixed protein structure
our strategy focuses obtaining comprehensive set high-resolution structural fragments without using artificial data restricting fragment lengths
decided partition non-redundant set high-resolution protein structures into fragments consist 4 14 residues because preliminary tests indicated lack high structural similarity more than 50 percent all fragments when larger lengths were considered
subsequently clustering techniques were employed identify structural motifs recurrent different protein structures
over 1,000 recurrent fragment structures classes were found each considered peptide length when structural variation proportional length fragment was allowed
suggested important determine how well classes fragment library cover fold space order estimate its value
when applied protein structures not used construction database coverage turned out 99 percent average using 1 angstrom rmsd threshold
latter implies majority cases studied so-called irregular regions loops also reconstructed recurrent building blocks
through employment global fit reconstruction algorithm backbone traces were generated having average accuracy 0.48 angstrom rmsd
additionally ability use brix local secondary structure prediction was examined looking at sequence-structure relationship within classes
according previous findings sequence conservation within classes was rather low because large number determined building blocks originating different families
nonetheless analysis led quantitative illustration context-dependence polypeptide structure
significant amount small sequences tend display strong structural ambiguity: fragments length 5 14 percent fragment pairs identical sequences structural difference within range helix-to-sheet jump
so-called plastic sequences i.e sequences display diverse structural conformations display strong preference aliphatic residues alanine valine leucine
fragments more than 5 residues sequence plasticity no longer observed showing need additional context determine secondary structure much reduced longer fragments
