 introduction 
extracellular matrix major component extravascular tissue region stroma plays central role morphogenesis including embryogenesis tissue repair wound healing new blood vessel growth cancer invasion
large body research concentrated understanding how cell-ecm interactions impact regulate morphogenic processes
results investigations illuminate active role ecm transmitting biochemical signals mechanical forces mediate cell survival phenotype shape orientation
area continues target intense investigation
cells equipped upregulate transmembrane receptors enable them receive signals interact their environment
integrins one receptor stimulated various proteins ecm
endothelial cells attach directly collagen fibers ecm through formula integrin receptors
biochemical signals originating within cell affect integrin-ligand binding affinity consequently modulate cellular adhesion matrix
focal adhesion complexes form bind directly cell's cytoskeleton
once assembled focal adhesion anchors cell ecm used cell movement
focal adhesions assembled disassembled dynamically facilitate cell migration
migratory guidance via focal adhesion binding sites ecm phenomenon referred contact guidance plays key role guiding new vessel growth 
physical properties ecm density heterogeneity stiffness affect cell behavior also area current investigation
matrigel popular gelatinous protein substrate vitro experiments angiogenesis largely composed collagen laminin contains growth factors all provide environment conducive cell survival
experiments endothelial cells matrigel increasing stiffness gel disrupting organization cellular cytoskeleton inhibits formation vascular cell networks
cells respond alterations mechanical properties ecm example upregulating their focal adhesions stiffer substrates
anchorage-dependent cells including endothelial cells increasing stiffness ecm therefore results increased cell traction slower migration speeds
measurements matrigel stiffness function density show positive relationship between two mechanical properties
density increases so does matrix stiffness
light two findings not surprising experimental study also shows slower cell migration speeds matrix density increases
moreover matrices higher fiber density transfer less strain cell experiments endothelial cells cultured collagen gels demonstrate directional sprouting called branching induced collagen matrix tension
thus via integrin receptors mechanical properties ecm influence cell-matrix interactions modulate cell shape cell migration speed formation vascular networks
understanding how individual cells interpret biochemical mechanical signals ecm only part whole picture
morphogenic processes also require multicellular coordination
addition guidance cues cells receive ecm they also receive signals each other
during new vessel growth cells adhere each other through cell-cell junctions called cadherins order migrate cells must coordinate integrin mediated focal adhesions cell-cell bonds
process referred collective cluster migration
during collective migration cell clusters often organize two-dimensional sheets 
cells also ability condition ecm invasion producing proteolytic enzymes degrade specific ecm proteins
addition cells synthesize ecm components collagen fibronectin further reorganize ecm forces they exert during migration
collagen fibrils align response mechanical loading cells reorient direction applied load
tractional forces exerted vascular endothelial cells matrigel cause cords tracks aligned fibers form promoting cell elongation motility
