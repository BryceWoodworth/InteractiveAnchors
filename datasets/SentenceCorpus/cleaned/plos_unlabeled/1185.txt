 introduction 
multiparameter flow cytometry widely used study cell cycle its perturbation context both basic research routine clinical analysis
analyses may use wide range fluorescent reporters correlate expression key molecular components cell cycle cyclins cyclin dependent kinases quantify dna content
regardless particular fluorophores used quantitative methodology ensuing synthesis biological knowledge based statistical analyses experimental data sets
single variable distributions may include calculations moments increasing orders provide mean variance skewness etc cumulative indices kolmogorov-smirnov test
more complex multi-variate approaches may involve discriminant function cluster principal component analysis n-dimensional space

spatial position vcells within cell cycle initially determined real flow data set
information each vcell assigned temporal position within mean inter-mitotic time allowing cell cycle events dna replication cell division stochastically predicted
after vpopulation evolved given period they may compared further experimental data set enable important simulation parameters governing their evolution optimised constrained so correlations between respective data sets maximised
standard approaches studying cell cycle involve statistical analysis distributions either 1d involving nuclear content reporters 2d when further cell cycle molecular reporters also included
thus inherently whole population measures only describe cell variability via global parameters standard deviation mean
whilst automated analytical approaches been developed order reduce user subjectivity majority flow analyses still involve user-defined gating as-measured data set identify segment sub-population cells
subsequent mapping population onto 2d dot plots fluorescence provides temporal snapshots further partitioning cells different compartments g 1 s g 2/m within normal polypoid cycles
apparent quantitative assessments become inaccurate varying extent subjective they based either user identification various components dot plot fitting gaussian distributions representing g 1 s g 2/m fractions dna content histogram
challenge current investigation adopt computational approach where analytical interpretive steps implemented at simulated biology stage not raw data outputs
no new data added approach computer simulations could viewed elaborate form data analysis
however methodology does deliver new insight process delivering continuous simulation dynamic evolution cellular system between fixed sampling points
respect provides physical validation when applying various hypotheses interpret experimental data
also goes some way visualising variation between individual cells gives rise biological heterogeneity stochastic simulation delivers report population dynamics each every cell tracked
