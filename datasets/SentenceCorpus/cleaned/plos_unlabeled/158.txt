 
identification classification genes pseudogenes duplicated regions still constitutes challenge standard automated genome annotation procedures
using integrated homology orthology analysis independent current gene annotation identified 9,484 9,017 gene duplicates human mouse respectively
basis integrity their coding regions classified them into functional inactive duplicates allowing us define first consistent comprehensive collection 1,811 human 1,581 mouse unprocessed pseudogenes
furthermore total 14,172 human mouse duplicates predicted functional genes many 420 not included current reference gene databases therefore correspond likely novel mammalian genes
some correspond partial duplicates less than half length original source genes yet they conserved syntenic among different mammalian lineages
genes unprocessed pseudogenes obtained here will enable further studies mechanisms involved gene duplication well fate duplicated genes
 introduction 
gene duplication major source biological innovation diversity provides necessary conditions appearance new more specialized protein functions
eukaryotic genomes there two major mechanisms through coding gene regions duplicate: retrotransposition non-homologous recombination
whereas retrotransposition lead rare occasions functional mrna copy usually results processed pseudogenes
present study focuses gene copies other hand arose through non-homologous recombination produces intact genes copies
generally agreed after gene duplications there period functional redundancy consequently partial relaxation their associated selective constraints
allows each copy accept higher level sequence modification therefore explore new more specialized roles long basic ancestral function not compromised
although situation eventually lead formation novel genes generally believed normally ends silencing one copies accumulation lethal mutations preservation other same basic ancestral function
non-functional paralogs then expected accumulate mutations at neutral rate degenerate unprocessed pseudogenes
similarly apart duplicated exons lead alternatively spliced isoforms incomplete duplications genes neither transcribed nor translated into complete functional proteins also expected undergo neutral degeneration right after their formation occurs vast majority processed pseudogenes
currently silencing genes after duplication poorly understood
its frequency been indirectly inferred either through theoretical approaches study functional genes exclusively without taking into account population dead gene copies probably due lack consistent annotation regions public databases
not only identification unprocessed pseudogenes but also overall identification classification independent gene copies within regions underwent several rounds tandem duplications not completely solved exemplified detailed analysis particular region human chromosome 2
previous global analyses dead gene copies mammals focused mainly retrotransposed pseudogenes appear far more abundant easier detect than unprocessed pseudogenes
already attempted define collections unprocessed pseudogenes context genome-wide identification intergenic pseudogenes several sequenced genomes
estimated number regions fluctuated significantly within mammals: between 3,000 4,500 per genome
however basis our recent more detailed analysis finished human chromosomes 2 4 estimate human genome might actually contain no more than 2,000 unprocessed pseudogenes because previous sets were somewhat inflated misclassified retrotranscribed pseudogenes
addition large-scale approximations several hundred unprocessed pseudogenes also been identified during annotation single human chromosomes detailed studies focused particular gene families genomic regions
despite all efforts considerable fraction human mouse unprocessed pseudogenes likely unannotated incorrectly classified owing difficulties analyzing complex regions multiple copies genes
using filtering procedures performed available assemblies human mouse genomes carried out consistent comprehensive search gene duplicates independent previous gene annotations
distinguished potentially active non-functional copies order construct first reliable set unprocessed pseudogenes
