 introduction 
conventional evolutionary game theory predicts natural selection favours selfish strong spite existing evidence showing cooperation more widespread than theory predicts
when cooperation modelled terms prisoner's dilemma solution replicator dynamics equation infinite well-mixed populations dictates extinction cooperators defectors
cooperators become evolutionarily competitive however whenever individuals constrained interact few others along edges sparse graphs recently concluded two independent studies
both studies place individuals nodes static graph associate their social ties vertices linking nodes throughout evolution every individual possibility changing her strategy but not her social ties
been shown under strong selection heterogeneous graphs lead significant increase overall survivability cooperation modelled terms most popular social dilemmas played networks different degrees heterogeneity
classical pd act cooperation involves cost c provider resulting benefit b recipient simple relation been obtained single cooperator chance survive population defectors whenever selection weak : b/c z where z stands average number ties each individual
both studies show games graphs open window emergence cooperation showing how social viscosity alone contribute emergence cooperation
however recent data shows realistic networks exhibit average connectivity values ranging 2 170 associated heterogeneity intermediate between single-scale broad-scale differs connectivity values typically used previous studies
instance network movie actors exhibits average connectivity 30 whereas collaboration networks based co-authorship published papers vary average values 4 9 up 15
terms simple rule evolution cooperation graphs reported values z require benefits often exceed costs more than one order magnitude single cooperator survive
none previous results strong weak selection graphs capable explaining how cooperation thrives social networks
other mechanisms at work here allow survival cooperation
most evolutionary models developed so far social interactions fixed outset
immutable social ties associated naturally static graphs imply individuals no control over number frequency duration their ties; they only evolve their behavioural strategy
similar observation made studies related physical properties complex networks
analyzed networks constitute but one static snapshot networks been typically produced some growth process
yet networks naturally evolved before will continue evolve after snapshot been taken
indeed recent longitudinal studies evolving social networks indicate global properties seem remain rather stable whereas individual patterns social ties remain evolving time
hence assuming fixed population size global average connectivity one may ask: what role do changes interaction framework play evolution cooperation extent will social dilemmas influence topology heterogeneity evolving network
using minimal model combines strategy evolution topological evolution requirements individual cognitive capacities very small investigate under conditions cooperation may thrive
network heterogeneity now emerges result entangled co-evolutionary dynamics will shown play crucial role facilitating cooperative behaviour
let us consider two types individuals cooperators defectors who engage several most popular social dilemmas cooperation
they not required accumulate information all other players only those they immediately connected
moreover they able decide equal footing all players those ties they want maintain those they want change
given edge individuals b at extremes say satisfied edge if strategy b cooperator being dissatisfied otherwise
if satisfied she will decide maintain link
if dissatisfied then she may compete b rewire link rewiring being attempted random neighbour b intuition behind reasoning following: simple agents being rational individuals limited information tend interact other agents close social manner
sense agent more likely encounter one friends b become friend b's neighbour
moreover selecting neighbour inconvenient partner may turn out good choice since partner also tries establish links cooperators making more likely rewiring results tie cooperator
indeed all social dilemmas described below link cooperator maximizes fitness any individual irrespective its strategy
consequently all individuals naturally seek establish links cooperators
hence rewiring neighbour defector certainly good choice individuals local information only
social dilemmas cooperation examined work modelled terms symmetric two-player games where players either cooperate defect upon interaction
when both cooperate they receive payoff r other hand when both defect they both obtain payoff p two remaining possibilities occur when one defects other cooperates resulting payoff t defector s cooperator
depending relative ordering four payoff values assuming mutual cooperation preferred over mutual defection three well-known social dilemmas emerge snowdrift game stag-hunt game prisoner's dilemma
dilemma follows players' payoff preferences
sg game players referred greedy since they prefer unilateral defection mutual cooperation
sh game mutual defection preferred unilateral cooperation resulting intrinsic fear players cooperate
finally both dilemmas combined pd game making most difficult situation cooperation arise
adopt convention normalize difference between mutual cooperation mutual defection 1 making r 1 p 0 respectively
consequence investigate all dilemmas summarized table 1 2-d parameter space depicted figure 2 where payoff t satisfies 0 t 2 payoff s satisfies 1 s 1
fitness each individual corresponds total accumulated payoff resulting pairwise interactions all her neighbours
fact our model cooperators defectors interact via social ties they both decide upon establishes coupling between individual strategy population structure: game payoff induces now entangled co-evolution strategy structure
adaptive individual behaviour introduces new time scale not necessarily equal time scale associated strategy evolution
depending ratio w e / different fates may occur cooperation
indeed whenever w 0 recover results
other hand increasing w individuals become apt adapt their ties increasing efficiency
general however one expects two time scales comparable magnitude realistic situations
w provides measure individuals' inertia react their rational choices both at strategy topological levels: large values w reflect populations individuals react promptly adverse ties whereas smaller values reflect some overall inertia topological change
general type response will change individual individual
hence w reflects here average characteristic population
