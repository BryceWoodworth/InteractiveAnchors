work analyzed predicted growth factor capture under flow using computer modeling three-dimensional experimental approach includes pertinent circulation characteristics pulsatile flow competing binding interactions limited bioavailability
understanding controlling features process was desired
experimental module consisted bioreactor synthetic endothelial-lined hollow fibers under flow
physical design system was incorporated into model parameters
heparin-binding growth factor fibroblast growth factor-2 was used both experiments simulations
our computational model was composed three parts: media flow equations mass transport equations cell surface reaction equations
model based flow reactions within single hollow fiber was scaled linearly total number fibers comparison experimental results
our model predicted experiments confirmed removal heparan sulfate system would result dramatic loss binding heparin-binding proteins but not proteins do not bind heparin
model further predicted significant loss bound protein at flow rates only slightly higher than average capillary flow rates corroborated experimentally suggesting probability capture single pass at high flow rates extremely low
several other key parameters were investigated coupling between receptors proteoglycans shown critical impact successful capture
combined system offers opportunities examine circulation capture straightforward quantitative manner should prove advantageous biologicals drug delivery investigations
 introduction 
bioavailability molecules they circulate through bloodstream crucial factor their signaling capability
half-life circulation determine effectiveness drug simply regulating opportunities molecule interact vessel wall
although vivo measurements routinely made researchers monitor serum levels molecules determine half-lives interactions microenvironment not easily measured observed
while some molecules may long circulation life many may only single opportunity interact blood vessel walls before being filtered through liver kidneys
addition even molecules long circulation life may still face impediments direct interaction endothelium
example case vascular endothelial growth factor when bound bevacizumab monoclonal antibody vegf
bevacizumab been shown increase circulating concentration vegf cancer patients when compared patients not undergoing therapy because increased half-life growth factor-antibody complex; however complex unable bind vegf receptors making delivery vegf questionable
order better understand vessel microenvironment accurately monitor drug interactions context microenvironment better tools needed provide meaningful measurements predict fate molecules circulation
many important measurements continue made using vitro mammalian tissue culture methods but there obvious limitations traditional two-dimensional culture approach
circulation influence flow whether molecule remains fluid phase binds vessel wall dominant factor
influence cannot ascertained static tissue culture studies
example velocity blood aorta 400 mm/sec while at capillary level less than 1 mm/sec
reduction velocity allows exchange processes at capillary level take place more efficiently likely also affects activity molecules circulation rely cell surface binding order fulfill their roles
while direct measurement binding process difficult our model makes use commercial bioreactor endothelial-lined hollow tubes operating under pulsatile flow mimic vascular environment architecture directly measure loss molecules they pass through hollow fibers
used single pass method allow better assessment effect flow either retaining molecules circulation permitting their interaction vessels
our approach also makes use bolus administration since typical way drugs would delivered clinical setting
binding fibroblast growth factor-2 its cell surface receptor role heparan sulfate proteoglycans regulating process been research interest many years because their role angiogenesis growth new blood vessels existing vessels
knowledge how processes work could aid development new therapeutics control tumor growth assist clinically treatment chronic wounds
order understand mechanism fgf-2-mediated cell proliferation multitude experimental studies been undertaken past two decades several computational models fgf-2 binding its receptor fgfr hspg been proposed
insight gained through experiment-coupled modeling could not otherwise readily obtained
nugent edelman were among earliest researchers develop simple model includes three species fgf-2 fgfr hspg
they measured kinetic binding rate constants experimentally used their model analyze data thereby providing foundation investigating complexity fgf-2 binding
similar approach was used ibrahimi et al investigate stepwise assembly ternary fgf-2-fgfr-hspg complex conjunction their surface plasmon resonance measurements
introduced more complexity into fgf-2 binding model inclusion heparin binding receptor dimerization formation alternative hspg-fgfr species
recent models moved towards including intracellular signaling
exception work filion popel included diffusive transport previous simulation work been based static tissue culture environment may quite different dynamic vivo environment blood vessels
introduced computational model based flow environment competitive binding fgf-2 fgfr hspg pulsatile flow environment was addressed mimic blood vessel-like hollow fibers
paper use updated version model explore how specific parameters flow rate impact fgf-2 capture receptor binding compare our results experimental studies
insights regard importance surface coupling ligand depletion zones within fluid phase were found
described simulation package provides new valuable way investigate growth factor capture easily extended other biologically relevant molecules drugs
