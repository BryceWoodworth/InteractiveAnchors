 
drug molecules not only interact specific targets but also alter state function associated biological network
how design drugs evaluate their functions at systems level becomes key issue highly efficient low side-effect drug design
arachidonic acid metabolic network network produces inflammatory mediators several enzymes including cyclooxygenase-2 been used targets anti-inflammatory drugs
however neither century-old nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs nor recently revocatory vioxx provided completely successful anti-inflammatory treatment
gain more insights into anti-inflammatory drug design authors studied dynamic properties arachidonic acid metabolic network human polymorphous leukocytes
metabolic flux exogenous aa effects drug efficacy been analyzed using ordinary differential equations
flux balance aa network was found important efficient safe drug design
when only 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor was used flux cox-2 pathway was increased significantly showing single functional inhibitor cannot effectively control production inflammatory mediators
when both cox-2 5-lox were blocked production inflammatory mediators could completely shut off
authors also investigated differences between dual-functional cox-2 5-lox inhibitor mixture two types inhibitors
their work provides example integration systems biology drug discovery
 introduction 
nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs widely used treatment musculoskeletal pain other conditions
us more than 1 percent population uses nsaids daily market nsaids now amounts more than $6 billion annually worldwide
although nsaids do alleviate aches pains drugs undesirable side effects gastrointestinal tract central nervous system addition potential exacerbation conditions asthma
findings cyclooxygenase-2 plays major role inflammation inhibition cox-1 causes gastrointestinal toxicity mild bleeding diathesis had suggested selective cox-2 inhibitor would effective anti-inflammatory drug low gastrointestinal side effects
ironically unexpected cardiovascular side effects selective cox-2 inhibitors surfaced
thus september 30 2004 merck company announced voluntary withdrawal company's cox-2 inhibitor vioxx
other fda-approved cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib valdecoxib being re-evaluated
despite years studies safe anti-inflammatory drug design remains great challenge
failures anti-inflammatory drug design illustrate limitations current drug discovery paradigm
steady waning productivity pharmaceutical industry past decade been observed
decline coincides introduction target-based drug discovery
recently medicinal chemists started think about drug discovery systems biology perspective
studying cross-talks between biological responses rather than one one may provide better understanding disease development achieve accurate evaluation drug efficacy toxicity
new approach been applied safe drug design
example former smithkline beecham focused blood coagulation cascade biochemical network
armed good understanding disease regulatory network level company used model predictions develop fully humanized anti factor ix antibody entered clinical trials
rajasethupathy et al recently reviewed advances practical applications systems biology drug discovery
researchers promote development network-based drug design devises drug-treatment strategies level disease system using computational models high-throughput experiments
paper study dynamic properties arachidonic acid metabolic network human polymorphonuclear leukocytes hope gaining more insights into anti-inflammatory drug design
ordinary differential equation model aa metabolic network was developed
flux analysis simulation addition exogenous aa were performed study network balance
therapeutic effects anti-inflammatory inhibitors were simulated difference between dual functional cox-2 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors mixture two types inhibitors was studied
corresponding experiments introduction exogenous aa cox-2 5-lox inhibitors were performed were found consistent model predictions
our work shows flux balance important efficacy safety drugs
compared traditional single-target drugs drugs against multiple targets control network balance lead safer treatment
