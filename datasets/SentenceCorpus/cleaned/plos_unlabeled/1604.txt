 introduction 
many biological social technological networks product evolutionary process guided their growth
tracking how networks changed over time help us answer questions about why currently observed network structures exist how they may change future
analyses network growth dynamics studied how properties node centrality community structure change over time how structural patterns been gained lost how information propagates network 
however many cases only static snapshot network available without node-by-node edge-by-edge history changes
biology archetypical domain where older networks been lost ancestral species gone extinct evolved into present-day organisms
example while do few protein-protein interaction networks extant organisms networks do not form linear progression instead derived species at leaves phylogenetic tree
networks separated millions years evolution insufficient track changes at fine level detail
social networks typically only single current snapshot available due privacy concerns simply because network was not closely tracked since its inception
lack data makes understanding how network arose difficult
often although do not know network's past do know general principle governs network's forward growth
several network growth models been widely used explain emergent features observed real-world networks
models provide iterative procedure growing random graphs exhibit similar topological features class real networks
example preferential attachment explained many properties growing world wide web
duplication-mutation complementarity model was found middendorf et al generative model best fit d melanogaster protein interaction network
forest fire model was shown produce networks properties power-law degree distribution densification shrinking diameter similar properties real-world online social networks
although random graph models themselves been useful understanding global changes network randomly grown network will generally not isomorphically match target network
means history random graph will not correspond history real network
hence forward growth random networks only explore properties generic model cannot track individual observed node's journey through time
problem avoided however if instead growing random graph forward according evolutionary model decompose actual observed network backwards time dictated model
resulting sequence networks constitute model-inferred history present-day network
reconstructing ancestral networks many applications
inferred histories used estimate age nodes model evolution interactions track emergence prevalent network clusters motifs
addition proposed growth models validated selecting corresponding history best matches known history other external information
leskovec et al explore idea computing likelihood model based how well model explains each observed edge given complete history network
augments judging model its ability reproduce certain global network properties itself misleading
example middendorf et al found networks grown forward according small-world model reproduced small-world property characteristic d melanogaster ppi network but did not match empirical ppi network other aspects
leskovec et al made similar observation social network models
ancestor reconstruction also used down-sample network create realistic but smaller network preserves key topological properties node labels
used faster execution expensive graph algorithms visualization purposes
biological network setting network histories provide view evolution complementary derived sequence data alone
social network setting if network's owner decides disclose only single network successful network reconstruction would allow us estimate when particular node entered network reproduce its activity since being member
could privacy implications might warrant need additional anonymization randomization network
some attempts been made find small seed graphs particular models may started
leskovec et al under kronecker model hormozdiari et al under duplication-based model found seed graphs likely produce graphs specified properties
seed graphs thought ancestral graphs at very large timescales but techniques infer them do not generalize shorter timescales nor do they incorporate node labels
previous studies time-varying networks solve related network inference problems but assume different available data
example use exponential random graph models other approaches inferring dynamic networks requires observed node attributes at each time point
they also limited because they use models without plausible biological mechanism require set nodes known at each time point
wiuf et al use importance sampling compute most likely parameters gave rise ppi network c elegans according duplication-attachment model but they do not explicitly reconstruct ancient networks
mithani et al only model loss gain edges amongst fixed set nodes metabolic networks
there also been some work inferring ancestral biological networks using gene trees
approaches play tape duplication instructions encoded gene tree backwards
gene tree provides sequence-level view evolutionary history should correlate network history but their relationship also complementary
further gene tree approaches only capture node arrival loss do not account models edge evolution constrained only consider trees built per gene family
network alignment between two extant species also been used find conserved network structures putatively correspond ancestral subnetworks
however methods do not model evolution interactions do so using heuristic measures
finally study ancestral biological sequences long history supported extensive work phylogenetics
sequence reconstructions been used associate genes their function understand how environment affected genomes determine amino acid composition ancestral life
answering similar questions network setting however requires significantly different methodologies
here propose likelihood-based framework reconstructing predecessor graphs at many timescales preferential attachment duplication-mutation complementarity forest fire network growth models
our efficient greedy heuristic finds high likelihood ancestral graphs using only topological information preserves identity each node allowing history each node edge tracked
gain confidence procedure show using simulated data network histories inferred models even presence some network noise
when applied protein-protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae inferred dmc-based history agrees many previously predicted features ppi network evolution
accurately estimates sequence-derived age protein when using dmc model identifies known functionally related proteins product duplication events
addition predicts older proteins more likely at core protein complexes confirming result obtained via other means 
comparing predicted protein ages using different models further confirm dmc better mechanism model growth ppi networks compared pa model ff model designed web social networks
conversely when applied social network dmc model does not produce accurate ancestral network reconstruction pa ff model also outperforms dmc social network context at task identifying users who putatively mediated network's growth attracting new members join service
thus models social network evolution do not transfer well biological networks vice versa well-studied expected notion confirm through alternative means
also used our reconstructed history ppi network make several novel predictions
example estimate arrival time extant ancestral interactions predict newly added extant edges often connect proteins within same complex modules recently gained many peripheral units
history also used track change network topological properties over time clustering coefficient find been decreasing recent evolution
analysis duplication rates over inferred history suggests proteins fewer extant interactions been involved largest number duplication events broad agreement existing belief proteins many interactions evolve more slowly
addition reconstruction predicts paralogous relationships between proteins strongly implied network topology partially agree sequence-based estimates
thus reconstructed history makes number detailed predictions about relative order events evolution yeast ppi many correlate known biology many novel
ability algorithms reconstruct significant features network's history topology alone further confirms utility models network evolution suggests alternative approach validate growth models ultimately reveals some history network encoded single snapshot
