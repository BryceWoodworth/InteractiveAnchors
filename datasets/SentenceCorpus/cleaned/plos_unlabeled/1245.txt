 
male rocky mountain elk produce loud high fundamental frequency bugles during mating season contrast male european red deer who produces loud low fundamental frequency roaring calls
critical step understanding vocal communication relate sound complexity anatomy physiology causal manner
experimentation at sound source often difficult vivo mammals simulated here finite element model larynx wave propagation model vocal tract both based morphology biomechanics elk
model produce wide range fundamental frequencies
low fundamental frequencies require low vocal fold strain but large lung pressure large glottal flow if sound intensity level exceed 70 db at 10 m distance
high-frequency bugle requires both large muscular effort high lung pressure but at least 10 db more intensity level achieved
glottal efficiency ration radiated sound power aerodynamic power at glottis higher elk suggesting advantage high-pitched signaling
advantage based two aspects; first lower airflow required aerodynamic power second acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies
both signal types used respective males during mating season probably serve honest signals
two signal types relate differently physical qualities sender
low-frequency sound relates overall body size via strong relationship between acoustic parameters size vocal organs body size
high-frequency bugle may signal muscular strength endurance via vocalizing at edge mechanism efficiency critical
 introduction 
contrary expectation based body size some large male mammals use high-pitched vocalization display
dichotomy between low frequency high frequency calls vocal signaling male characteristics rarely so dramatic two closely related cervid species: european red deer rocky mountain elk
during mating season one species recognizable low frequency roar while other well-known its high frequency bugle
acoustic signals vocal communication mammals generally very complex because various selective pressures shape them
complexity related natural sexual selection
example signal considered honest if reliable information about sender extracted body size physical strength
animal's body size physical strength important implications its physiology ecology fecundity its aggressive interactions mating success
male red deer mating call was selected low vocal tract resonance characteristics provide reliable information about body size due interconnected size-dependent factors involved sound production
contrast difficult make case body size signaled high fundamental frequency whistle-like bugle elk
elk calls sometimes contain low frequency components but not consistently
signature bugle
what provoked evolution calls would generally associated much smaller animals
here investigate physiological tradeoffs related production high low frequency sounds
