 introduction 
dna primarily exists double helix
however dna also adopt other structural conformations potential play critical roles range biological processes
one structure g-quadruplex dna was discovered late 1980s when biochemical experiments demonstrated oligodeoxynucleotides contain four separated runs two three four guanines spontaneously form four-stranded structures
g4 dna structures consist stacked planar g-quartets held together hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between four guanines each g-tracts
guanines come single nucleic acid strand multiple strands strands may oriented parallel anti-parallel orientation
g4 dna structures compact highly stable under physiological ph salt conditions resistant degradation nucleases melting temperatures even higher than duplex dna
g4 dna structures formed runs two guanines but they less stable than those longer runs
g4 dna structure considerable interest because its potential influence variety biological processes
example telomeric dna most eukaryotic organisms consists g-rich repeated sequence ending 3 single stranded g-rich overhang form g-quadruplexes vitro
first direct evidence presence g4 dna structures vivo came studies using g4 dna-specific antibodies detect intermolecular structures at ciliate telomeres where their formation dissolution cell cycle regulated 
however described detail paper telomeric dnas not only chromosomal sequences ability form g4 dna structures
because experimental characterization vivo functions g4 dna structures proved difficult especially at non-telomeric loci genome-wide computational analyses played increasing role identification regions potential form g4 dna structures
distribution g4 dna motifs been investigated s cerevisiae human number prokaryotic genomes hope patterns occurrence will provide insight into functional roles structures
each case computational search variations g4 dna motif usually four tracts three more guanines separated loop regions any nucleotide was performed
across wide range species g4 dna motifs were found telomeres g-rich micro mini-satellites near promoters within ribosomal dna
human genome genes near g4 dna motifs fall into specific functional classes; example oncogenes tumor suppressor genes particularly high low g4 dna forming potential
recently human g4 dna motifs were reported associated recombination prone regions show mutational patterns preserved potential form g4 dna structures
computational analysis s cerevisiae identified several hundred g4 dna motifs found them significantly associated promoter regions lesser extent open reading frames
thus studies wide range organisms led proposal g4 dna structures affect multiple cellular processes beyond their roles at telomeres
however direct support formation function g4 dna structures vivo still largely unavailable
study integrated genome sequence data experimental analysis computational exploration genome annotations investigate conservation function g4 dna structures s cerevisiae
evolutionary conservation across related species played vital role defining functional elements genes regulatory sites
identified sequence motifs potential form g-quadruplex structures s cerevisiae six other fungal species assessed evolutionary sequence conservation motifs across seven species
found g4 dna motifs nucleotides comprising them were more evolutionarily conserved than expected chance; however they were not strongly conserved genes many known regulatory sites
additionally patterns nucleotide conservation within motifs indicated evolutionary constraint was likely result pressure maintain ability motifs form g4 dna structures
analysis provides strong evidence many computationally identified g4 dna motifs form functional g4 dna structures vivo
characterize possible functions structures evaluated association conserved non-conserved g4 dna motifs range genomic features
