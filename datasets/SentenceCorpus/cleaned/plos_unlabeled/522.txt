 introduction 
intriguing question analysis biological networks whether biological characteristics protein essentiality explained its placement network i.e whether topological prominence implies biological importance
one first connections between two context protein interaction network so-called centrality-lethality rule was observed jeong colleagues who demonstrated high-degree nodes hubs protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae contain more essential proteins than would expected chance
since then correlation between degree essentiality was confirmed other studies but until recently there was no systematic attempt examine reasons correlation
particular what main topological determinant essentiality
number immediate neighbors some other more global topological property essential proteins may protein interaction network
jeong colleagues suggested overrepresentation essential proteins among high-degree nodes attributed central role hubs play mediating interactions among numerous less connected proteins
indeed removal hubs disrupts connectivity network measured network diameter size largest connected component more than removal equivalent number random nodes
therefore under assumption organism's function depends connectivity among various parts its interactome hubs would predominantly essential because they play central role maintaining connectivity
recently he colleagues challenged hypothesis essentiality being function global network structure proposed majority proteins essential due their involvement one more essential protein protein interactions distributed uniformly at random along network edges
under hypothesis hubs proposed predominantly essential because they involved more interactions thus more likely involved one essential
work carefully evaluate each proposed explanations centrality-lethality rule
recently several hypotheses linked structural properties protein interaction networks biological phenomena come under scrutiny main concern being observed properties due experimental artifacts and/or other biases present networks lack any biological implication
limit impact biases results reported our study use six variants genomewide protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae compiled diverse sources interaction evidence 
assess whether essentiality hubs related their role maintaining network connectivity performed two tests
first if were case then would expect essential hubs more important maintaining network connectivity than nonessential hubs
found not case
next addition node degree consider several other measures topological prominence demonstrate some them better predictors role node plays network connectivity than node degree
thus if essentiality were related maintaining network connectivity then one would expect essentiality better correlated centrality measures than node degree
however found node degree better predictor essentiality than any other measure tested
reject essential protein interaction model used hypothesis testing approach
namely observed model implies probability protein essential independent probability another noninteracting protein essential
however tested networks essentiality noninteracting proteins share interaction partners correlated
thus reject independence assumption result essential protein interaction model high confidence
motivated our findings propose alternative explanation centrality-lethality rule
our explanation draws growing realization phenotypic effect gene-knockout experiments function group functionally related genes genes whose gene products members same multiprotein complex
well known densely connected subnetworks enriched proteins share biological function
therefore one would expect dense subnetworks protein interaction networks should either enriched depleted essential proteins
indeed hart colleagues observed essential proteins not distributed evenly among set automatically indentified multiprotein complexes
work observe same phenomenon holds potentially larger groups densely connected functionally related proteins call complex biological modules
demonstrate due uneven distribution essential proteins among cobims majority essential proteins lie those cobims enriched essential proteins call essential complex biological modules 
very definition ecobims contain relative their size more essential nodes than random group proteins same size
but what fraction all essential hubs members ecobims
how does number relate what expected chance
fact how does enrichment hubs members/nonmembers ecobims essential proteins relate enrichment values expected chance under suitable randomization protocol
propose membership ecobims largely accounts enrichment hubs essential proteins
support hypothesis found fraction essential proteins among non-ecobim hubs depending network only 13 35 percent almost low network average
furthermore essentiality nodes not members ecobims only weakly correlated their degree
finally using randomization experiment demonstrated properties characteristic protein interaction network unlikely corresponding randomized network
