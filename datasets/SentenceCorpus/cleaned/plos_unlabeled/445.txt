unfortunately binding sites typically short degenerate posing significant statistical challenge: many more matches known tf motifs occur genome than actually functional
however information about chromatin structure may help identify functional sites
particular been shown active regulatory regions usually depleted nucleosomes thereby enabling tfs bind dna those regions
here describe novel motif discovery algorithm employs informative prior over dna sequence positions based discriminative view nucleosome occupancy
when gibbs sampling algorithm applied yeast sequence-sets identified chip-chip correct motif found 52 percent more cases our informative prior than commonly used uniform prior
first demonstration nucleosome occupancy information used improve motif discovery
improvement dramatic even though using only statistical model predict nucleosome occupancy; expect our results improve further high-resolution genome-wide experimental nucleosome occupancy data becomes increasingly available
 introduction 
finding functional dna binding sites transcription factors throughout genome necessary step understanding transcriptional regulation
however despite explosion tf binding data high-throughput technologies like chip-chip dip-chip pbm gene expression arrays finding functional occurrences binding sites tfs remains difficult problem because binding sites most tfs short degenerate sequences occur frequently genome chance
particular matches known tf motifs genome often do not appear bound respective tfs vivo
one popular explanation when dna form chromatin not all parts dna equally accessible tfs
state dna wrapped around histone octamers forming nucleosomes
positioning nucleosomes along dna believed provide mechanism differential access tfs at potential binding sites
indeed been shown functional binding sites tfs at regulatory regions typically depleted nucleosomes vivo 
if knew precise positions nucleosomes throughout genome under various conditions could increase specificity motif finders restricting search functional binding sites nucleosome-free areas
here describe method incorporating nucleosome positioning information into motif discovery algorithms constructing informative priors biased toward less-occupied promoter positions
our method should improve motif discovery most when access high-resolution nucleosome occupancy data gathered under various vivo conditions
unfortunately data not currently available any organism at whole-genome scale let alone under variety conditions
nevertheless because our method probabilistic even noisy evidence regarding nucleosome positioning effectively exploited
example segal et al recently published computational model based high-quality experimental nucleosome binding data predicts probability each nucleotide position yeast genome being bound nucleosome; predictions intrinsic dna sequence thus independent condition but were purported explain around half nucleosome positions observed vivo
addition lee et al used chip-chip profile average nucleosome occupancy each yeast intergenic region
show informative positional priors whether learned computational occupancy predictions low-resolution average occupancy data significantly outperform not only commonly used uniform positional prior but also state-of-the-art motif discovery programs
