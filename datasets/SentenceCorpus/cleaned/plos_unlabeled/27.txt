important mechanism changing synaptic strength through movement neurotransmitter receptors regulatory proteins synapse
several activity-triggered biochemical events control movements
here use computer models explore how putative memory-related changes stabilised long after initial trigger beyond lifetime synaptic molecules
base our models published biochemical data experiments activity-dependent movement glutamate receptor ampar calcium-dependent kinase camkii
find both molecules participate distinct bistable switches
simulated switches effective long periods despite molecular turnover biochemical fluctuations arising small numbers molecules synapse
ampar switch arises novel self-recruitment process where presence sufficient receptors biases receptor movement cycle insert still more receptors into synapse
camkii switch arises autophosphorylation kinase
switches may function tightly coupled manner relatively independently
latter case leads multiple stable states synapse
propose similar self-recruitment cycles may important maintaining levels many molecules undergo regulated movement may lead combinatorial possible stable states systems like synapse
 introduction 
long-term storage neuronal information believed occur through alterations synaptic efficacy
many mechanisms been identified changes synaptic strength including modulation neurotransmitter release conductivity changes receptors changes numbers receptors active synapses structural alterations synapse
among insertion glutamate receptors alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate subtype into postsynaptic membrane modulation receptor conductance phosphorylation key events modulating synaptic efficacy
fundamental issue challenges all mechanisms: how they last lifetime
synaptic memories decay at least three ways: turnover diffusive exchange stochasticity
turnover major postsynaptic molecules ranges periods few minutes few days may further enhanced synaptic activity
one solution loss memory due molecular turnover concept self-sustaining molecular switches
typically involve some form molecular feedback giving rise chemical systems stably settle into one two states
two-state bistable systems store information binary manner
provided there steady supply replacement molecules molecular turnover tolerated since newly synthesised na ve molecules become entrained current state system
some current proposals bistable synaptic switches include calcium calmodulin type ii kinase hypothesis mitogen-activated protein kinase feedback loop recently mammalian target rapamycin protein synthesis loop
camkii model been posed most detail most complete structural correlates
according model camkii at synapse undergo autophosphorylation leads activation kinase
activated kinase molecules catalyze phosphorylation yet more camkii molecules resulting self-sustaining cycle
mapk feedback loop model also involves self-sustaining cycle but case several intermediate molecules participate loop
protein synthesis loop model based observation local protein translation machinery associated synapses
messenger rna several proteins including ribosomes themselves also present
thus high local protein synthesis creates machinery maintaining high levels synthesis
protein synthetic loop regulated mtor
second mechanism decay synaptic memory diffusive exchange synaptic proteins leading washout specific states synapse
extrapolations free diffusion constants suggest diffusive exchange between synaptic spine dendrite likely rapid under 10 s even proteins
postsynaptic density elaborate cytoskeletal signalling complex provides anchors synaptic proteins close region presynaptic neurotransmitter release
anchoring solves problem free diffusion washout active molecules but introduces problem regulating insertion molecules into correct locations
there considerable evidence targeted trafficking molecules psd
one trafficking cycle insertion removal glutamate receptors ampa subtype into synaptic membrane
striking physiologically important example receptor insertion conversion silent synapses lacking ampa receptors into active synapses full complement receptors
delivery ampars synaptic membrane involves two streams: constitutive pathway involving glutamate receptor heteromers 2 3 activity-dependent pathway involving glur12
based current evidence activity-dependent insertion glur12 into synaptic membrane stimulated phosphorylation ser845
there also evidence phosphorylation being implicated synaptic plasticity
camkii also translocates psd upon calmodulin binding stimulation
thus addition their known involvement synaptic plasticity ampars camkii mechanisms activity-dependent recruitment psd manner acts counter washout processes
combination attributes makes molecules interesting candidates analysing molecular memory mechanisms
nevertheless over long term even anchoring events reversible additional processes must considered stability
third important obstacle stable memory formation biochemical stochasticity
causes uncertainty outcome biochemical reactions involving small numbers molecules
fluctuations severe at synapse where many important signalling molecules present low numbers less than 100 molecules
typical synaptic volume 0.1 fl there estimated five free ca 2 ions
under stochastic conditions there finite probability spontaneous state flips bistable molecular switches
lifetime stable states depends both reaction rates number molecules
example proposed mapk switch does not fare well synaptic volumes spontaneously flips state time scale minutes
nevertheless time estimates highly dependent assumptions about diffusion anchoring levels noise other synaptic pathways
putting themes together plausible synaptic memory mechanism might look like bistable molecular switch resistant turnover incorporates traffic molecules psd unlikely spontaneously flip state even when small synaptic molecule numbers taken into account
study report novel glutamate receptor based switch emerges consideration its traffic satisfies criteria
also examine possible camkii switch context criteria
finally integrate switches explore how multiple synaptic states may arise
