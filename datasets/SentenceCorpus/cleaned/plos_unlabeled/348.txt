 introduction 
outbreaks highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza southeast asia europe africa devastating consequences poultry resulted numerous infections humans
although infections animal reservoir continue accumulate virus does not seem spread extensively among humans
nevertheless fear human infections may ultimately spark influenza pandemic
indeed recent clusters infections human households hint at possibility virus transmission humans who were infected poultry their household contacts
suggestions strengthened observation mutations recent h5n1 viruses seem predispose virus more efficient transmission mammals including humans 
likely virus pandemic potential will present itself initially through increase number infections humans who been close contact case infected animals
therefore rapid detection control clusters infections key importance
clusters may result multiple introductions animal reservoir multiple transmission events humans who were infected animals multiple transmission events humans who were themselves infected humans
obviously evidence most worrisome indicates virus acquired ability spread efficiently humans
often thought pathogens animal reservoir made jump new host species usually not well-adapted sustained transmission new host transmissibility new species will gradually increase over time process adaptation means natural selection
interestingly however case h5n1 avian influenza humans evidence so far does not seem fit prediction
mechanisms could responsible lack efficient secondary human-to-human transmission could due dose effect whereby humans infected animals receive higher infection dose than humans infected humans behavioural changes after infection limit spread virus after been detected
paper develop method detect quantify different routes virus transmission household setting
our main aim investigate whether within-household pathogen transmission been restricted transmission primary infected individual whether there evidence transmission chain extended beyond first generation human-to-human infections
our analyses based theoretical developments distribution final size epidemic finite populations allow construction flexible methods analyse within-household transmission chains
apply method recent study within-household transmission highly pathogenic avian influenza h7n7 subtype caused large epidemic poultry netherlands 2003
shortly after detection virus circulation dutch authorities undertook aggressive control strategy consisted animal movement ban affected regions tracing screening suspected flocks culling infected contiguous flocks
all total 255 flocks became infected during period nine weeks more than 30 million birds were culled
subsequent studies poultry workers revealed at least 86 infections animal reservoir humans had taken place
addition more than 30 household contacts infected poultry workers who had not been direct contact poultry were reported positive
reports indicate human-to-human transmission did occur individuals infected animal reservoir
here analyse data transmission chains 24 households led 33 human-to-human transmission events measuring extent onward transmission humans who were infected humans
complement statistical analyses systematic power analyses obtain insight into study size needed able find significant secondary human-to-human transmission given present
although applied method specific dataset believe our method general interest enables rapid estimation within-household transmission rates based data easily gathered most infectious diseases
instance our method analysis not restricted analysis emerging pandemic influenza but just well used estimate different routes within-household transmission rates human influenza viruses importantly assess potential effectiveness control measures
