 introduction 
engagement tnf fas receptors trigger cell death apoptosis necrosis yet lead activation pro-survival signalling pathway nf b apoptosis represents tightly controlled mechanism cell death triggered internal external death signals stresses
mechanism involves sequence biochemical morphological changes resulting vacuolisation cellular content followed its phagocyte-mediated elimination
physiological process regulates cell homeostasis development clearance damaged virus-infected cancer cells
contrast pathological necrosis results plasma membrane disruption release intracellular content trigger inflammation neighbouring tissues
long seen accidental cell death necrosis also appears regulated possibly involved clearance virus-infected cancer cells escaped apoptosis 
dynamical modelling regulatory network controlling apoptosis non-apoptotic cell death survival pathways could help identify how under conditions cell chooses between different types cellular deaths survival
moreover modelling could suggest ways re-establish apoptotic death when altered yet trigger necrosis apoptosis-resistant cells
decision process involves several signalling pathways well multiple positive negative regulatory circuits
mathematical modelling provides rigorous integrative approach understand analyse dynamical behaviours complex systems
published models cell death control usually focus one death pathway only apoptotic extrinsic intrinsic pathways
few studies integrate both pathways some show concentration specific components contribute decision between death survival while other studies investigate balance between proliferation survival apoptosis specific cell types along role key components pathways but no mathematical models including necrosis available yet
moreover still lack models properly demonstrating how cellular conditions determine choice between necrosis apoptosis survival how what extent conversions allowed between fates
our study aims at identifying determinants cell fate decision process
three main phenotypes considered apoptosis non-apoptotic cell death survival
although pathways leading three phenotypes highly intertwined first describe them separately hereafter concentrating players chose include each pathway
summarised figure 1a description does not intend exhaustive but rather aims at covering most established processes participating cell fate decision
only apoptotic caspase-dependent pathway downstream fas tnf receptors considered here
upon engagement their ligands presence fadd specific death inducible signalling complex forms recruits pro-caspase-8
leads cleavage activation caspase-8
so-called type ii cells casp8 triggers intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway also responds dna damage directly through p53-mediated chain events
casp8 cleaves bh3-only protein bid then translocate mitochondria outer membrane
there bid competes anti-apoptotic bh3 family members bcl2 interaction proteins bax bak
consequently oligomerisation bax results mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation release pro-apoptotic factors
once released cytosol cytochrome c interacts apaf1 recruiting pro-caspase-9
presence datp enables assembly apoptosome complex responsible caspase-9 activation followed proteolytic activation pro-caspase-3
cleavage specific targets executioner caspases responsible major biochemical morphological changes characteristic apoptosis
smac/diablo released during momp cytosol where able inactivate caspase inhibitor xiap
casp3 also participates positive circuit inducing activation casp8
type i cells casp8 directly cleaves activates executioner caspases casp3
