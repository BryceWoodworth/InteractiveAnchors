 introduction 
t cells adaptive immune system use their t cell receptors scan surfaces antigen-presenting-cells antigen form specific peptides bound major-histocompatibility complexes
scanning apcs t cells rapid estimates suggesting individual t cell spends only 1 5 minutes interacting single apc if lacks specific pmhc
experiments demonstrated t cells extremely sensitive specific pmhc responding few 1 10 pmhc sea thousands chemically similar self pmhc
also been demonstrated single amino acid substitution presented peptide dramatically alter t cell response
speed sensitivity specificity been dubbed s 3 characteristics antigen detection t cells 
observation t cells transiently interact apcs do not express specific pmhc suggests decision respond occurs within seconds encounter
rapid turnover t cell-apc contacts vivo accelerates search specific pmhc allowing numerous unique t cell-apc interactions
decision respond gives rise stop signal commonly followed formation immune synapse stable adhesion between t cell apc persists upwards 30 minutes facilitates second sustained phase signaling
experiments mathematical modeling been extensively used understand efficiency t cell activation
during sustained signaling phase serial binding many tcr single pmhc been postulated increase t cell sensitivity
serial binding expected because bonds formed between tcr agonist pmhc transient half-lives range 1 100 s
other hand t cell specificity been addressed kinetic proofreading model
model postulates series tcr-proximal steps binding subsequent phosphorylation tcr associated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs signaling molecules occur upon pmhc binding signaling events require continued tcr engagement proceed
productive signal transduced only after several transformations taken place
model t cells able discriminate between different pmhc imposing threshold tcr-pmhc dissociation rate constant 
combining serial binding kinetic proofreading reveals balance between sensitivity specificity gives rise optimal formula efficient t cell activation effect been experimentally observed
efficiency t cell activation models others usually quantified number activated tcrs integrated over whole cell after relatively long period interaction apc
additionally several studies reported correlations between tcr/pmhc bond dissociation constant but not formula efficiency t cell activation measured after formula hour cytoxicity and/or cytokine assays 
however t cells been observed respond stimulatory pmhc less than minute at least cytotoxic t cells stable contact interface not required pmhc detection
serial binding/kinetic proofreading models do not predict specificity short time scales part because signals generated high concentrations weakly binding self pmhc found comparable signals generated low concentrations high affinity agonist pmhc
moreover early t cell response unlikely determined equilibrium parameter formula quite unlikely t cell-apc interface attains equilibrium at short times
more likely formula important determinant efficiency t cell activation during sustained phase signaling well after initial decision respond
paper investigate putative mechanism antigen discrimination during early phase tcr signaling
specifically examine role tcr/pmhc rebinding allowing t cells make rapid reliable decisions respond
explicitly accounting tcr/pmhc rebinding within existing formulations diffusion-limited membrane reactions find rebinding very little effect canonical proofreading models
simple modification accounts signal persistence at tcr allows individual tcr integrate duration multiple rebinding events
consequence scheme discrimination sum-of-binding model now sensitive both association dissociation rate constants tcr-pmhc bond
enhanced sensitivity leads finding t cell discriminate between wider spectrum antigens than would predicted traditional serial binding/kinetic proofreading model
further show coreceptors but not tcr clustering important achieve rapid rebinding events
addition show signal persistence at tcr does not allow high concentrations endogenous pmhc generate spurious signals
finally show our general conclusions unchanged when our cartoon kinetic proofreading model replaced detailed model tcr-proximal signaling
propose t cells discriminate antigen based formula formula via threshold sum-of-binding allows rapid reliable t cell responses specific pmhc
