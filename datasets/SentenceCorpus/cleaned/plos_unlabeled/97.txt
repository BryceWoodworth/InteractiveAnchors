they also suggest side chain side chain interaction across neighbouring strands key determinant amyloid fibril formation their self-propagating ability
 introduction 
increasing number human pathologies associated conversion peptides proteins their soluble functional forms into well-defined fibrillar aggregates
diseases broadly grouped into neurodegenerative conditions fibrillar aggregation occurs brain nonneuropathic localised amyloidoses aggregation occurs single type tissue other than brain nonneuropathic systemic amyloidoses aggregation occurs multiple tissues
fibrillar deposits associated human pathologies generally described amyloid fibrils when they accumulate extracellularly whereas term intracellular inclusions been suggested more appropriate when fibrils morphologically structurally related extracellular amyloid form inside cell 
amyloid formation not restricted however those polypeptide chains recognised links protein deposition diseases
several other proteins no link been found form fibrillar aggregates vitro morphological structural tinctorial properties allow them classified amyloid-like fibrils
finding led idea ability form amyloid structure inherent property polypeptide chains encoded main backbone chain interactions
theoretical perspective was also recently shown simple considerations geometry symmetry sufficient explain within same sequence-independent framework emergence limited menu native-like conformations single chain aggregate structures multiple chains 
generic ability form amyloid structure apparently been exploited living systems specific purposes some organisms been found convert during their normal physiological life cycle one more their endogenous proteins into amyloid-like fibrils functional properties rather than deleterious effects
perhaps most surprising functions ability amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates serve nonchromosomal genetic element
proteins ure2p sup35p het-s adopt fibrillar conformation addition giving rise specific phenotypes appears self-propagating transmissible infectious 
their soluble states proteins able form fibrillar aggregates do not share any obvious sequence identity structural homology each other
spite differences precursor proteins morphological inspection reveals common properties resulting fibrils
images obtained transmission electron microscopy atomic force microscopy reveal fibrils usually consist 2 6 protofilaments each about 2 5 nm diameter
protofilaments generally twist together form fibrils typically 7 13 nm wide associate laterally form long ribbons 2 5 nm high up 30 nm wide
x-ray fibre diffraction data shown protein peptide molecules arranged so polypeptide chain forms strands run perpendicular long axis fibril 
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance x-ray micro nano-crystallography other techniques systematic protein engineering coupled site-directed spin-labelling fluorescence-labelling transformed our ability gain insight into structures fibrillar aggregates residue-specific detail
advances allowed us go beyond generic notions fibrillar appearance presence cross structure
studies indeed allowed identification regions sequence form stabilise cross core fibrils opposed those stretches flexible exposed solvent
many cases arrangement various molecules fibrils also been determined clarifying nature intermolecular contacts structural stacking molecules along fibril axis
one frequent characteristic emerging studies particularly fibrils formed long sequences parallel in-register arrangements strands fibril core but antiparallel arrangements also possible especially shorter strands 
at same time mutational studies amyloid aggregation kinetics revealed simple correlations between physico chemical properties aggregation propensities
allowed development different methods successfully predict aggregation-prone regions amino-acid sequence full-length protein
all approaches focus predicting intrinsic aggregation propensity sequence stretch using only amino-acid sequence input
possible parallel/antiparallel arrangement sequence stretch itself was also taken into account
molecular dynamics simulations sequence fragments mounted idealized strand templates either parallel antiparallel were used identify most amyloidogenic fragments specific case
template amyloid structure based pira also employed very recent method identifying fibril-forming segments
yet-unanswered question why pira found most frequent arrangement strands fibril core
here introduce computational approach editing pairwise energy function based propensities two residues found within sheet facing one another neighbouring strands determined dataset globular proteins known native structures
extract two different propensity sets depending orientation neighbouring strands
our method associates energy scores specific pairings two sequence stretches same length further assumes distinct protein molecules involved fibril formation will adopt minimum-energy pairings order better stabilise cross core
novel feature our method ability predict registry intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between amyloidogenic sequence stretches
way rationalise observed tendency proteins assemble into parallel sheets individual strands in-register contributing form stackings same residue type along fibril axis
our algorithm also able correctly discriminate orientation between intermolecular strands either parallel antiparallel
further demonstration robustness approach will illustrate ability our algorithm predict portions sequence forming cross core fibrils set proteins excellent agreement experimentally determined amyloid structures similar previously proposed methods 
our approach based key assumption universal mechanism responsible sheet formation both globular proteins fibrillar aggregates
successful predictions obtained work suggest validity above hypothesis agreement unified framework presented previously
