 
five independent groups reported microarray studies identify dozens rhythmically expressed genes fruit fly drosophila melanogaster
limited overlap among lists discovered genes makes difficult determine if any exhibit truly rhythmic patterns expression
reanalyzed data all five reports found two sources observed discrepancies use different expression pattern detection algorithms underlying variation among datasets
improve upon methods originally employed developed new analysis involves compilation all existing data application identical transformation standardization procedures followed anova-based statistical prescreening three separate classes post hoc analysis: cross-correlation various cycling waveforms autocorrelation previously described fast fourier transform based technique
permutation-based statistical tests were used derive significance measures all post hoc tests
find application our method most significantly anova prescreening procedure significantly reduces false discovery rate relative observed among results original five reports while maintaining desirable statistical power
identify set 81 cycling transcripts previously found one more original reports well novel set 133 transcripts not found any original studies
introduce novel analysis method compensates variability observed among original five drosophila circadian array reports
based statistical fidelity our meta-analysis results results our initial validation experiments predict many our newly found genes bona fide cyclers suggest they may lead new insights into pathways through clock mechanisms regulate behavioral rhythms
 introduction 
most organisms exhibit rhythms behavior physiology occur circadian daily periods
rhythms driven endogenous biological clocks regulated via rhythmic expression core set pacemaker genes
salient feature many circadian genes conserved across wide span evolutionary divergence cyclic expression their mrnas
several studies exploited characteristic identify novel clock-related genes
five reports based model organism drosophila melanogaster utilize microarray technology discover clock-related genes exhibit cyclic mrna expression fly heads
cumulatively identify hundreds rhythmic transcripts; yet there striking lack overlap among lists identified genes
raises doubts fidelity reported expression patterns
given importance rhythmic transcription circadian clock function revisited studies attempting identify root causes existing incongruities find transcripts exhibit truly cyclic expression
our analyses suggest compilation statistical prescreening all available data lead substantial reductions false discovery rate
addition find data quality algorithm choice play essential roles determining transcripts ultimately detected any particular analysis
introduce novel procedure well improvements previously published techniques identify core set rhythmically expressed transcripts high statistical fidelity
intriguingly our list includes 133 transcripts not found original reports
