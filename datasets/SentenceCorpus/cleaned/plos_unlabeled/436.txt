 introduction 
past work both human animal subjects focused neural correlates attention
attention raises firing rate input output gain orientation-selective neurons visual cortex shifts response curves so physiologically relevant stimuli fall high-gain region
also when attended stimuli overlap recorded receptive field gamma-band frequency components local field potentials single-unit spike responses increase
gamma oscillations field potential likely reflect correlated network activity supported simulations spiking neurons inhibitory recurrent excitatory inhibitory coupling
attention thought influence cholingergic neuromodulation presumably affects synchrony interneuron networks involved gamma oscillations
well-known correlated network discharge effectively drives postsynaptic cells making gamma-band activity signature efficient signal propagation
would allow attended objects increase downstream responses compared nonattended objects
contrast assess role gamma oscillations signal coding neural populations participating gamma oscillatory dynamics
tasks where attention improves performance typically involve discrimination between different signals visual cues different colors shapes orientations
although there large number studies exploring how gamma rhythms generated networks spiking neurons mechanisms gamma oscillations modify signal discrimination elusive three aspects
first relation between gain modulation gamma oscillations both attention-dependent unclear
second temporal relation between network gamma rhythm time course driving signal often unclear
third gamma-induced synchronous firing may deleterious coding due increased variability population activity 
popular framework neural coding number spikes produced single neuron population neurons carries information about driving signal
however vivo spike trains often show spike count fano factor close even exceeds unity
trial-to-trial variability deleterious code performance degrades putative spike-count based signal-discrimination schemes
certain situations fano factors much less than 1 observed visual cortex auditory cortex salamander retina
extreme case if neuron fires high probability response relevant input signal rarely fires otherwise then signal estimated spike count small error
addition spike-timing reliability neuron robustly emits just single spike during steep upstroke input seldom fires elsewhere also supportive binary spiking
study model essence gamma frequency modulation simple rhythmic forcing population uncoupled spiking neurons
show gamma oscillations endow population spike counts binomial-like statistics improve signal discrimination over range stimuli through reduced spike-count variability
way propose connection between gamma oscillations enhanced task performance found behavioral experiments
our results both distinct complementary previously described influences rhythmic network behavior temporal coding schemes improving spike precision providing clock phase-based code
