 introduction 
fluorescent proteins been widely used genetically encodable fusion tags monitor protein localizations dynamics live cells
recently new class green fluorescent protein like proteins been discovered reversibly photoswitched between fluorescent non-fluorescent state
reversible photoswitching photochromic organic molecules fulgides diarylethenes usually not accompanied fluorescence switching reversibility very remarkable unique feature may allow fundamentally new applications
example reversible photoswitching also known kindling may provide nanoscale resolution far field fluorescence optical microscopy much below diffraction limit
likewise reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins will enable repeated tracking protein location movement single cells
since fluorescence sensitively read out bulky crystal prospect erasable three-dimensional data storage equally intriguing 
gfp-like protein asfp595 isolated sea anemone anemonia sulcata prototype reversibly switchable fluorescent protein
protein switched its non-fluorescent off state fluorescent state green light 568 nm wavelength
so-called kindled state same green light elicits red fluorescence emission at 595 nm
upon kindling intensity absorption maximum at 568 nm diminishes absorption peak at 445 nm appears
kindled state promptly switched back initial off state blue light 445 nm
alternatively off state repopulated through thermal relaxation within seconds
addition if irradiated intense green light over long period time asfp595 also irreversibly converted into fluorescent state cannot quenched light any more
nature state hitherto unknown
switching cycle asfp595 reversible repeated many times without significant photobleaching
properties render asfp595 promising fluorescence marker high-resolution optical far-field microscopy recently demonstrated hofmann coworkers
currently however its low fluorescence quantum yield rather slow switching kinetics photochromic properties asfp595 need improved
systematically exploit potential switchable proteins enable rational improvements properties asfp595 detailed molecular understanding photoswitching mechanism mandatory
aim study obtain detailed mechanistic picture photoswitching mechanism asfp595 at atomic level i.e understand dynamics both activation process de-activation process 
high-resolution crystal structures wild-type asfp595 its off state ser158val mutant its state ala143ser mutant its off states were recently determined
similar gfp asfp595 adopts barrel fold enclosing chromophore 2-acetyl-5-imidazolinone
chromophore post-translationally formed autocatalytic cyclization-oxidation reaction met63-tyr64-gly65 triad
compared gfp chromophore system myg elongated additional carbonyl group 
reversible photoswitching asfp595 was possible even within protein crystals x-ray analysis showed off-on switching fluorescence accompanied conformational trans-cis isomerization chromophore
recent study shown isomerization induces changes protonation pattern chromophore some surrounding amino acids changes account observed shifts absorption spectrum upon kindling
based comparison between measured calculated absorption spectra major protonation states ground state been assigned zwitterion anion trans conformer whereas neutral chromophore dominant cis conformation 
here study photochemical behavior each previously identified protonation states
addressed following questions: how does light absorption induce isomerization chromophore within protein matrix how do different protonation states affect internal conversion mechanism
fluorescent species how fluorescence quantum yield increased
address questions carried out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations using hybrid quantum-classical qm/mm approach
approach includes diabatic surface hopping between excited state ground state
forces acting chromophore were calculated using casscf multi-reference method although not always yielding highly accurate excitation fluorescence energies shown reliable method mechanistic studies photochemical reactions involving conical intersections 
number approaches modeling nonadiabatic dynamics been described literature tully's fewest switches surface hopping multiple spawning
recent reviews see
context qm/mm simulations surface hopping approach photobiological problems been pioneered warshel coworkers
diabatic surface hopping approach used work differs other approaches two main respects
first our approach binary decision made at each integration time step trajectory based only current wavefunctions ground excited states
second hopping only allowed at conical intersection seam where hopping probability approaches unity
could principle underestimate crossing probabilty because do not allow transitions regions strong coupling but no real crossing
however ultra-fast photochemical reactions large polyatomic systems decay predominantly takes place at ci seam also shown others
thus most surface hops essentially diabatic justifying our approach
addition both energy momentum conserved upon transition trajectory never leaves diabatic energy surface
theoretical background algorithmic implementation diabatic surface hopping detailed supporting information 
several theoretical studies photochemistry gfp chromophore been conducted applying both static ab initio dft calculations dynamics simulations based semi-empirical hamiltonian
addition vertical excitation energies asfp595 model chromophores gas phase continuum dielectric were calculated dft ab initio methods well minimal protein environment means dft casscf calculations within qm/mm approach 
identifying key residues cavity asfp595 chromophore our nonadiabatic qm/mm molecular dynamics simulations elucidate how protein surrounding governs photoreactivity photoswitchable protein
based simulations provide new mechanism qualitatively explains measured decay times quantum yields predicts structures protonation states photochemical intermediates irreversibly fluorescent state
also suggest excited state proton transfer play important mechanistic role
however detailed study espt processes beyond scope paper
our predictions probed e.g time-resolved fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x-ray crystallography
