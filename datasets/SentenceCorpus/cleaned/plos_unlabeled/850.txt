 
predicting protein function structure remains active area interest particularly structural genomics initiatives where substantial number structures initially solved little no functional characterisation
although global structure comparison methods used transfer functional annotations relationship between fold function complex particularly functionally diverse superfamilies evolved through different secondary structure embellishments common structural core
majority prediction algorithms employ local templates built known predicted functional residues
here present novel method automatically generates structural motifs associated different functional sub-families within functionally diverse domain superfamilies
templates created purely basis their specificity given fsg method makes no prior prediction functional sites nor assumes specific physico-chemical properties residues
flora able accurately discriminate between homologous domains different functions substantially outperforms popular structure comparison methods leading function prediction method
benchmark flora large data set enzyme superfamilies all three major protein classes demonstrate functional relevance motifs identifies
also provide novel predictions enzymatic activity large number structures solved protein structure initiative
overall show flora able effectively detect functionally similar protein domain structures purely using patterns structural conservation all residues
 introduction 
prediction protein function structure become increasing interest significant proportion structures solved structural genomics initiatives lack functional annotation
furthermore structure-based approaches particular interest predicting binding sites and/or catalytic sites purposes protein engineering pharmaceutical development
many current methods focus encoding template functional residues then aligning template whole structures
problems taking approach deciding what qualifies functional residue creating biologically-accurate templates ever increasing number available protein structures being deposited pdb
resources catalytic site atlas carefully curated hand restricted residues directly involved catalysis whereas msdsite pdbsite generate templates based active site residues defined pdb file authors
although resources undoubtedly extremely valuable questionable whether sufficient coverage pdb maintained when manual intervention required
address problem generating templates all protein structures there number methods aim do automatically
example reverse template method decomposes query structure into tri-peptide fragments then matched against non-redundant set pdb structures using search algorithm jess
hits evaluated according sequence similarity local environment template
gasp method uses genetic algorithm construct templates based their ability discriminate between different protein families against background representatives scop database
similarly drespat implements graph theoretical approach discover structural patterns associated given family proteins locate ligand binding motifs
multiprot provide template structures through multiple structure alignment
recent extension evolutionary trace method binding site prediction was used create structural templates based predicted functional residues
siteengines produces templates matching geometry physico-chemical properties residues binding site clefts
well atom residue-level templates other non-template-based approaches seek compare electrostatic properties binding sites surface accessible clefts often co-locate active sites 
one inherent complexity using pdb structures transfer annotations between enzymes binding state protein crystallised example structures crystallised non-cognate ligands substrate analogs transition states apo-enzymes
consequence precise geometric matching active site region problematic due conformational changes occur ligand binding
address issue methods mentioned above use variety approaches graph matching geometric hashing various tolerance levels
soippa method takes alternative approach using geometric potential characterise shape formed given set c atoms account both local global relationships between residues across protein structure
recent ligand-binding site comparison analysis soippa was able detect distant similarities between very different protein folds binding range adenine-containing ligands 
despite many template methods present literature very few publicly available general user
hence first step assigning function structure often use global structure comparison methods detect distant evolutionary relationships even where sequence similarity weak
methods been specifically applied function prediction assign confidence values when inheriting go terms between related structures
however detecting very distant relatives remains challenge structure comparison methods generally give absolute measure structural distance rmsd applying cut-off at one deduce two proteins perform related functions results many missed relationships
analyses cath shown although function structure well conserved majority superfamilies there significant number highly diverse superfamilies where not case
moreover latter superfamilies disproportionately represented both pdb genomes tend exhibit wide range core biological functions across large range species
analysis reeves et al showed relatives within superfamilies tend share common evolutionary core but core embellished different insertions secondary structure elements often correlate changes function
however although structural embellishments might change some facet function others found relatives still retain other aspects common
therefore calculating global measure structural similarity distance between two proteins less informative than focussing structural motifs relevant given aspect function
flora algorithm presented here was designed derive structural templates functional sub-groups within diverse cath superfamilies
flora first performs global structure alignment across superfamily recognise distinctive structural patterns associated each fsg builds templates based patterns
new functional homologues then detected using global structural alignments relatives each fsg again but only scoring similarity over positions identified flora motif
approach performs very well discriminating between different enzymatic functions compared global methods another motif-based approach
although benchmark here enzyme superfamilies method applicable superfamilies containing non-enzymatic relatives
test flora automatically generated large data set domains 29 diverse superfamilies
our data set allows us look at variation flora results between superfamilies stress importance using large test data set benchmarking methods
benchmarked flora against ce cathedral reverse templates give indication how performs comparison other standard methods function prediction
also present some examples structural motifs identified flora explain their functional relevance
finally use flora make novel predictions function proteins solved protein structure initiative
