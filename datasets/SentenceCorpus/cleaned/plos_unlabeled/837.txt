 introduction 
microarray comparative genomic hybridisation provides estimate relative abundance genomic dna taken comparator reference organisms hybridisation microarray containing probes represent sequences reference organism
method been used number biological applications including detection human chromosomal aberrations ; comparisons bacterial human pathogens ; bacterial plant pathogens ; industrially-important bacteria ; comparative transcriptomics xenopus laevis 
numerous algorithms software packages been applied analysis acgh data prokaryotes
majority partition reference organism sequences into two mutually exclusive classes: sequences present sequences absent divergent comparator organism
observed hybridisation data each case assumed reliable proxies classes
manuscript describe apply improved method analysis acgh data bacterial genome comparisons
method incorporates spatial information about cds location reference genome hidden markov model
spatial information expected capture pertinent biological evolutionary information operon structure regions lateral gene transfer
our approach differs previously proposed widely-used methods applied bacterial acgh gack mpp consider hybridisation intensities each reference probe measurements independent their genomic location thus more similar methods arraylearna incorporates predicted operon structure into interpretations microarray expression data restricted set organisms
compare relative performance our method commonly used bacterial acgh analysis algorithms software
demonstrate several assumptions common bacterial acgh analysis methods concerning relationship between observed hybridisation scores ratios presence absence reference cds comparator organism do not always hold strongly particularly case more distantly-related organisms
our data particular do not support distinction between present absent divergent classes sequence but rather between those sequences reference organism do those do not putative orthologues comparator genome
find hmm better predictor reference sequences do not putative orthologue comparator organism than other methods tested
spatial organisation sequences reference genome previously been incorporated into methods applied acgh analyses copy number variation human genomes
been represented using hmm segmentation methods
simple smoothing methods also been used identify breakpoints data
however problem domain human copy number acgh differs problem domain bacterial comparative genomic acgh
best our knowledge study describes first application method incorporating spatial information acgh comparative genomics unsequenced bacteria first demonstration applicability technique whole across bacterial genera
pectobacterium atrosepticum pectobacterium carotovorum dickeya spp
plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria share common ancestor
despite their many similarities commercially significant pathogens differ their host range geographical distribution aetiology environmental persistence
molecular origins differences not well understood but ecological flexibility likely indicative dynamic plastic genome core accessory components
there currently two publicly available annotated genomes organisms: pba strain scri1043 dickeya dadantii strain 3937
availability sequences rapidly advanced our understanding organisms but broader comparisons expected deliver greater insight into evolution function sre
major common virulence factors sre plant cell wall degrading enzymes degrade plant cell wall release nutrients so-called brute force attack
other virulence factors include virulence-associated secretion systems siderophores cell-surface polysaccharides agglutinins 
contrast bacterial plant pathogens pseudomonas spp
associated biotrophic stealth interaction host
stealth pathogens employ mechanisms type iii secretion system translocate effectors into host cells
effectors modulate host plant's biochemical responses implementing wide array strategies circumvent host immunity
however pba1043 dda3937 other sres also encode functioning t3ss other gene products associated stealth interaction indicating more complex relationship their hosts than simple brute-force necrotrophy
key factors confirmed role virulence include type iv type vi secretion systems phytotoxin coronafacic acid synthesised cfa gene cluster
other factors associated persistence adaptation wider environment been identified genes associated opine uptake biofilm formation antibiotic production nitrogen fixation 
many bacteria genes associated pathogenicity other phenotypically-distinguishing characters frequently associated islands horizontal gene transfer
gene complement often variable between strains species sometimes termed accessory genome order distinguish core genome provides functionality presumed essential all related organisms
expect observed differences between gene complements sre will reflect differences their phenotypes adaptations their distinct environments differences will preferentially located islands genes their genomes
use acgh apply our analysis method identify genomic islands pba1043 do not putative orthologues unsequenced pba strain scri1039 pcc strain scri193 sequenced dda3937
study coding sequences pba1043 predicted acgh absent divergent pba1039 pcc193 dda3937 interest because they may potentially contribute pba1043-specific phenotypes including host interactions
pairwise comparisons between pba1043 three organisms span range evolutionary distances since their most recent common ancestor pba1043 represent variation at strain species genus levels
our results sre support hypothesis genomes sre continue modified acquisition genomic islands model accessory genome niche-specific functionality composed at least part horizontally-acquired genomic islands
identify major differences cds carried within accessory genomes sre while recapitulate previous observations major genomic islands made using alternative approaches also find number unexpected differences provide insight into may play direct role determining variation amongst sre terms their environmental survival host range aetiology
