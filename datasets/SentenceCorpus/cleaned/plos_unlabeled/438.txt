 
micrornas important post-transcriptional regulators but extent regulation uncertain both regard number mirna genes their targets
using algorithm based intragenomic matching potential mirnas their targets coupled support vector machine classification mirna precursors explore potential regulation mirnas three plant genomes: arabidopsis thaliana populus trichocarpa oryza sativa
find intragenomic matching conjunction supervised learning approach contains enough information allow reliable computational prediction mirna candidates without requiring conservation across species
using method identify 1,200 2,500 2,100 mirna candidate genes capable extensive base-pairing potential target mrnas thaliana p trichocarpa o sativa respectively
more than five times number currently annotated mirnas plants
many candidates derived repeat regions yet they seem contain features necessary correct processing mirna machinery
conservation analysis indicates only few candidates conserved between species
conclude there large potential mirna-mediated regulatory interactions encoded genomes investigated plants
hypothesize some interactions may realized under special environmental conditions while others readily recruited when organisms diverge adapt new niches
 introduction 
small rnas now accepted major players control eukaryotic gene expression
most well known micrornas small interfering rnas both derived processing dsrna molecules members drosha/dicer family endonucleases
plants sirna mirna distinguished mainly their biogenesis not their mechanism action
mirnas arise stem-loop precursors encoded genome their major mechanism action plants thought post-transcriptional regulation through near-complementary base-pairing target mrnas leading specific endonucleolytic cleavage degradation target 
most initially discovered mirnas were so highly conserved evolution defining characteristic mirna was had conserved
attribute those mirnas discovered early been used successfully number groups computationally predict new mirna genes
basically methods scan genome inverted repeats potential form mirna precursors
scans typically find order hundreds thousands millions hairpins depending genome size search parameters
high number then reduced only keeping hairpins conserved other species
another approach search only transcribed sequences form expressed sequence tags
method works nonsequenced genomes efficiently reduces search space probably leading lower number false positives but method also misses candidates not covered expressed sequence tag libraries
mirbase version 8.2 arabidopsis thaliana 118 mirna genes listed most conserved down monocot oryza sativa
however studies noncoding rna shown lack conservation does not necessarily mean lack function
potentially all takes evolve mirna one many inverted repeats genome transcribed necessary structure sequence features recognized processed drosha/dicer
indeed large numbers more narrowly conserved mirnas also exist
recent bioinformatic study human identified patterns associated mirna precursors suggested number mirna precursors larger than 25,000
plants similar situation could exist
deep sequencing effort arabidopsis using massively parallel signature sequence technique revealed 75,000 distinct small rna species mapping large variety genomic contexts including exons introns repetitive dna intergenic regions
perhaps not surprising considering other studies finding unexpectedly large fractions eukaryotic genomes transcribed also outside antisense annotated protein-coding genes 
necessary feature any functional mirna must target at least one mrna
plants means mirna must almost complementary some part spliced mrna transcript
set rules allowing mismatches only certain positions been suggested based experimental observations
requirement target previously been used predict plant mirnas : instead relying phylogenetic conservation methods successfully used intragenomic matches potential target mrnas find hairpins potentially capable producing mirnas regulate target
intragenomic matches will inherently arise structure dynamics genome: retrotransposons formation pseudogenes other duplicative events provide sequences almost ready regulate originally copied gene ; likewise reverse strand one gene complementary other paralogous genes
not relying conservation between species intragenomic matching capable more fully charting potential post-transcriptional regulation mirnas
effort reduce spurious predictions earlier screens new mirnas removed candidates overlapping existing annotation repeats protein-coding regions
although filters probably increase signal-to-noise ratio they also introduce biases assuming repeat-derived sequences not functional each sequence segment only one function
however transposon-derived conventional mirnas been demonstrated arabidopsis recent work several groups show repeat-associated mirnas quite common mammals
borchert et al point 50 human mirnas associated alu repeats polymerase iii transcription
piriyapongsa et al link 55 experimentally characterized human mirnas different types transposable elements
18 conserved other vertebrate genomes authors predict additional 85 novel transposable element derived mirnas
observations along evidence very complex widespread transcriptional patterns eukaryotes including nested transcripts antisense transcription underlines importance enumerating all possible mirna/target interactions order explore full potential mirna-mediated regulation
