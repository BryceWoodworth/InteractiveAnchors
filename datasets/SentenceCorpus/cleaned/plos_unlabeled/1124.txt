 introduction 
atherosclerosis main cause coronary heart disease stroke two major causes death developed society
though previously initiation atherosclerosis was attributed mainly lipid accumulation within arterial walls now widely accepted inflammation plays vital role initiation progression disease 
some time cardiovascular effects high dose radiotherapy been known
variety effects observed presumed result inactivation large numbers cells associated functional impairment affected tissue
among effects direct damage structures heart including marked diffuse fibrotic damage especially pericardium myocardium pericardial adhesions microvascular damage stenosis valves coronary arteries; sorts damage occur both patients receiving rt experimental animals
there emerging evidence excess risk cardiovascular disease at much lower radiation doses occurring long time after radiation exposure japanese atomic bomb survivor life span study cohort various occupationally-exposed groups although not all
assuming they causal likely mechanisms effects low dose and/or chronic radiation exposures cardiovascular disease not clear
interest elevated levels pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 crp tnf inf but also increased levels anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 been observed japanese atomic bomb survivors
there was also dose-related elevation erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels igg iga total immunoglobulins cohort all markers systemic inflammation 
paper outline mathematical formulation model cardiovascular disease largely based inflammatory hypothesis articulated ross
motivation behind mathematical modelling encompass various factors contributing inflammatory process subsequently atherosclerotic formation
atherosclerosis not only multifactorial but also multi-step disease concentrate modelling chronic inflammation primarily at early stages disease but outlining treatment later stages lead plaque rupture
model some extent based model mckay et al although there significant departures elaborations model
particular features borrowed generally rather simpler models cobbold et al ibragimov et al
stability analysis simplified version model will performed
shall particularly concerned mechanisms effects cholesterol fractionated low dose radiation exposure inflammation model outline case radiation-induced monocyte cell death candidate pathway
