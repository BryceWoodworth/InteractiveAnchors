 
even post-genomic era identification candidate genes within loci associated human genetic diseases very demanding task because critical region may typically contain hundreds positional candidates
since genes implicated similar phenotypes tend share very similar expression profiles high throughput gene expression data may represent very important resource identify best candidates sequencing
however so far gene coexpression not been used very successfully prioritize positional candidates
show possible reliably identify disease-relevant relationships among genes massive microarray datasets concentrating only genes sharing similar expression profiles both human mouse
moreover show systematically integration human-mouse conserved coexpression phenotype similarity map allows efficient identification disease genes large genomic regions
finally using approach 850 omim loci characterized unknown molecular basis propose high-probability candidates 81 genetic diseases
our results demonstrate conserved coexpression even at human-mouse phylogenetic distance represents very strong criterion predict disease-relevant relationships among human genes
 introduction 
last two decades positional cloning been remarkably successful identification genes involved human disorders
more recently our ability map genetic disease loci strikingly increased due availability entire genome sequence
nevertheless once disease locus been mapped identification mutation responsible phenotype still represents very demanding task because mapped region may typically contain hundreds candidates
accordingly many phenotypes mapped genome linkage analysis not yet associated any validated disease gene
therefore definition strategies pinpoint most likely targets sequenced patients critical importance
many different strategies been proposed prioritize genes located critical map intervals
some methods so far developed rely observation disease genes tend share common global properties deduced directly absolute comparative sequence analysis
however most available prioritization strategies based widely accepted idea genes proteins living organisms deploy their functions part sophisticated functional modules based complex series physical metabolic regulatory interactions
although principle been extensively used even pre-genome era identify critical players many different biological phenomena present availability genome-scale information gene function protein-protein interactions gene expression different experimental models allows unprecedented opportunities approaching prioritization problem greater efficiency
theory use functional gene annotations would represent most straightforward approach candidate prioritization
however although strategy may very useful selected cases at present stage clear limitations either because overlooks non-annotated genes because not evident how annotated functions candidates relate disease phenotype
therefore computational methods less biased toward already consolidated knowledge may strong advantages 
particular protein-protein interaction maps gene coexpression data microarray experiments represent extremely rich sources potentially relevant information
recently direct integration very heterogeneous human interactome text mining-based map phenotype similarity allowed prediction high confidence candidates within large disease-associated loci 
although approach highly efficient clearly not exhaustive because very close functional relationships between genes proteins possible absence direct molecular binding
addition protein-protein interaction space currently under-sampled many genuine biological interactions not yet been identified experiments
conversely high-throughput experiments known result large fraction false positives
consistently low overlap protein-protein interactions between large-scale experiments even when same proteins considered testament problems
finally many known protein-protein interactions been ascertained through low-throughput experiments thus strongly biased towards better-studied proteins 
since genes involved same functions tend show very similar expression profiles coexpression analysis could very powerful approach inferring functional relationships may correlate similar disease phenotypes
accordingly global analyses shown genes highly coexpressed across microarray experiments display very similar functional annotation
however notable exceptions so far coexpression criterion not been employed very successfully prediction genetic disease candidates been used purpose only combination other independent evidence 
noisy nature high-throughput gene expression datasets may represent one possible explanations shortcoming
moreover even when coexpression two genes reproducibly observed under high number experimental conditions does not necessarily imply genes functionally related
instance extensive meta analysis microarray data across different species revealed neighboring genes more likely coexpressed than genes encoded distant genomic regions even if they not functionally related any obvious manner 
phylogenetic conservation been previously proposed very strong criterion identify functionally relevant coexpression links among genes
indeed significant coexpression two more orthologous genes very likely due selective advantage strongly suggesting functional relation
therefore conserved coexpression could much stronger criterion than single species coexpression relate genes involved similar disease phenotypes
report show conserved coexpression phenome analysis effectively integrated produce accurate predictions human disease genes
using approach were able select small number strong candidates 81 human diseases corresponding wide spectrum different phenotypes
