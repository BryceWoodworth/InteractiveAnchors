 introduction 
recent advances imaging techniques allow measurements time-varying biophysical quantities interest at high spatial temporal resolution
example voltage-sensitive dye imaging allows observation backpropagation individual action potentials up dendritic tree
calcium imaging techniques similarly allow imaging synaptic events individual synapses
data very well-suited constrain biophysically detailed models single cells
both dimensionality parameter space noisy undersampled nature observed data renders use statistical techniques desirable
here here use sequential monte carlo methods standard machine-learning approach hidden dynamical systems estimation automatically smooth noisy data
first step will do while inferring biophysically detailed models; second step inferring non-parametric models cellular nonlinearities
given laborious nature building biophysically detailed cellular models hand there long been strong emphasis robust automatic methods
large-scale efforts added need methods yielded exciting advances
neurofitter package example provides tight integration number standard simulation tools; implements large number search methods; uses combination wide variety cost functions measure quality model's fit data
however highly complex approaches while extremely flexible arguably make optimal use neither richness structure present statistical problem nor richness new data emerging imaging techniques
past been shown us others knowledge true transmembrane voltage decouples number fundamental parameters allowing simultaneous estimation spatial distribution multiple kinetically differing conductances; intercompartmental conductances; time-varying synaptic input
importantly inference problem form constrained linear regression single global optimum all parameters given data
none approaches however at present take various noise sources recording situations explicitly into account
here extend findings applying standard inference procedures well-founded statistical descriptions recording situations hope more specifically tailored approach will provide computationally cheaper more flexible robust solutions probabilistic approach will allow noise addressed principled manner
specifically approach issue noisy observations interpolation undersampled data first model-based then model-free setting
start exploring how accurate description cell used optimal de-noising infer unobserved variables ca 2 concentration voltage
then proceed show how accurate model cell inferred noisy signals first place; relies using model-based smoothing first step standard two-step iterative machine learning algorithm known expectation-maximisation
maximisation step here turns out weighted version our previous regression-based inference method assumed exact knowledge biophysical signals

note important factor formula ensures noise variance grows linearly time formula
currents formula will consider here three types:
