used brownian dynamics simulations study viscoelasticity crosslinked actin networks
two methods were employed bulk rheology segment-tracking rheology where former measures stress response applied shear strain latter analyzes thermal fluctuations individual actin segments network
was demonstrated storage shear modulus increases more addition acps form orthogonal crosslinks than those form parallel bundles
networks orthogonal crosslinks crosslink density increases power law exponent g function oscillation frequency decreases 0.75 reflects transverse thermal motion actin filaments near zero at low frequency
under increasing prestrain network becomes more elastic three regimes behavior observed each dominated different mechanisms: bending actin filaments bending acps at highest prestrain tested stretching actin filaments acps
last case only small portion actin filaments connected via highly stressed acps support strain
thus introduce concept supportive framework subset full network responsible high elasticity
notably entropic effects due thermal fluctuations appear important only at relatively low prestrains when average crosslinking distance comparable greater than persistence length filament
taken together our results suggest viscoelasticity actin network attributable different mechanisms depending amount prestrain
 introduction 
actin most abundant intracellular protein eukaryotic cells plays important role wide range biological mechanical phenomena
monomeric actin self-assembles filamentous form f-actin crosslinked into actin cytoskeleton various actin crosslinking proteins
been known mechanical force plays crucial role physiology eukaryotic cells therefore appropriate functions living cells attributable rigorous control their rheological properties
thus investigating rheological properties actin networks indispensable elucidating mechanics cells well understanding wide variety cellular processes
experiments been conducted probe viscoelastic properties cells reconstituted actin gels using variety techniques microbead rheology magnetic bead cytometry bulk rheology
experiments discrepancies been observed among measurements using dissimilar methodologies many observed features not well understood
example viscoelastic moduli measured single-bead passive microbead rheology much smaller than those determined 2-point microrheology bulk rheology
also although distinct power law responses storage modulus often been observed vivo vitro their origin not yet clearly understood
concurrently characteristics semi-flexible polymer networks been studied theoretically computationally
two 3-dimensional computational models studying affine nonaffine deformations semi-flexible networks responding large shear strain revealed two regimes dominated bending stretching filaments respectively
recently using microstructure-based continuum mechanics approach palmer boyce reproduced many rheological properties actin networks observed experiments
viscoelastic behavior semi-flexible networks was also investigated using dissipative particle dynamics concept microbead rheology where scale-free behavior bead displacement was observed
date however most models neither explicitly take into account acp mechanics nor systematically account thermal fluctuations nor they been used explore effects finite prestress viscoelasticity all potentially important factors governing matrix viscoelasticity
objective extending previous works providing new insights into underlying mechanisms develop brownian dynamics model actin network includes features steric interaction among filaments usage explicit crosslinkers more realistic morphology consideration crosslinker stiffness
measuring stress response applied oscillatory shear strain thermal fluctuations individual segments polymeric chain investigate viscoelastic properties actin-like networks
throughout paper convenience term actin network used refer network being simulated
should noted however some properties employed our model especially acps were estimated since they not well-known experimentally
due simplifications model parameter uncertainty results should therefore viewed representative generic crosslinked network but lack quantitatively precise correspondence actin networks
nevertheless found features semi-quantitatively capture experimentally observed behaviors actin networks
storage loss moduli g g followed power laws functions oscillation frequency
prestrain increased network became increasingly elastic
bending extensional stiffnesses actin filaments acps played important role depending degree prestrain
found mechanical response network dominated percolating supportive framework while other actin filaments contribute little viscoelastic moduli
surprisingly typical physiological conditions where distance between crosslinking points along f-actin much shorter than actin persistence length found thermal fluctuation plays little role viscoelasticity so network consisting crosslinked f-actins viewed essentially deterministic overdamped system viscous medium
sum our computational model elucidates how various mechanical responses govern viscoelastic properties network under different conditions
