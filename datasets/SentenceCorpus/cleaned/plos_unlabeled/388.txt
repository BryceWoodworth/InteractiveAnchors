 
alternative splicing gene duplication both processes diversify protein repertoire
recent examples shown sequence changes introduced may comparable those introduced gd
addition two processes inversely correlated at genomic scale: large gene families depleted splice variants vice versa
all together data strongly suggest both phenomena result interchangeability between their effects
here tested extent applies respect various protein characteristics
amounts gd per gene anticorrelated even when accounting different gene functions degrees sequence divergence
contrast two processes appear independent their influence variation mrna expression
further conducted detailed comparison effect sequence changes both alternative splice variants gene duplicates protein structure particular size location types sequence substitutions insertions/deletions
find general alternative splicing affects protein sequence structure more drastic way than gene duplication subsequent divergence
our results reveal interesting paradox between anticorrelation gd at genomic level their impact at protein level shows little no equivalence terms effects protein sequence structure function
discuss possible explanations relate order appearance gd gene family selection pressure imposed environment
 introduction 
alternative splicing gene duplication two main contributors diversity protein repertoire enormous impact protein sequence structure function
interestingly several recent studies point direct equivalence between gd
there some cases where alternative splice variants one organism similar gene duplicates another organism
example eukaryotic splicing factor u2af35 at least two functional splice variants human u2af35a u2af35b differ seven amino acids rna recognition motif
fugu orthologue u2af35-a no splice variant; instead there duplicate gene u2af35-b changes identical those found human splice variant u2af35b 
further changes introduced sequence constrained need preserve stable functional three-dimensional fold
indeed structural studies shown insertions deletions between gene duplicates tend happen at sequence locations where they less damaging loops at solvent-accessible locations
restrictions will apply irrespective source changes thus may introduce certain degree similarity between sequence changes associated gd
finally recent studies shown gd inversely correlated genome-wide scale i.e small gene families tend more genes alternative splice variants than do large families
findings together i.e anecdotal examples structural constraints anticorrelation at genomic level suggest gd interchangeable sources functional diversification
genes would not need produce additional variants form duplicates vice versa
here first tested anticorrelation between gd respect sequence divergence function gene expression
second studied interchangeability hypothesis at protein structure level asked what extent gd introduce changes sequence equivalent their nature effect structure function
end conducted large-scale comparison effects gd human mouse proteins
vast majority cases two processes result different protein modifications different functional implications
finding while consistent different molecular mechanisms underlying both phenomena contradicts anticorrelation observed at genomic level
discuss some possible explanations paradox
