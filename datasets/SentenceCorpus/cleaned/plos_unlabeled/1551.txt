goal was characterize quantitatively style play elicited healthy subject their dsm-diagnosed partner
approach exploits dynamics behavior elicited healthy proposer biosensor cognitive features characterize psychopathology group at other side interaction
using large cohort subjects found statistically significant clustering proposers' behavior overlapping range dsm-iv disorders including autism spectrum disorder borderline personality disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder major depressive disorder
further validate results developed computer agent replace human subject proposer role show also detect same four dsm-defined disorders
results suggest highly developed social sensitivities humans bring two-party social exchange exploited automated detect important psychopathologies using interpersonal behavioral probe not directly related defining diagnostic criteria
 introduction 
social interactions among humans reflect execution some most important complex behavioral software humans endowed
consequently should expect computations involved human social exchange subtle perhaps even difficult expose study controlled settings
however exposing computations crucial if improve our characterization understanding normal human cognitive function dysfunction
recent years components social exchange healthy subjects been probed using interactive economic exchange games
games typically involve two subjects interacting one multiple rounds through exchange monetary gestures one another
our purposes here games require three classes computation intact functioning minds interacting subjects
they require each subject compute norms what fair each exchange detect deviations monetary gestures deviate norms choose actions predicated deviations
experimental probes been used previously area behavioral economics neuroeconomics but here show behavioral gestures elicited context economic exchange games used classify certain psychopathologies
twist our effort here use data-driven approach examining reactions healthy partner kind biosensor while playing exchange game subject possessing psychopathology
