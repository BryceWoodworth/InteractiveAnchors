 introduction 
many recent studies both experimental computational point inherent ability proteins undergo under native state conditions large-amplitude conformational changes usually linked their biological function
proteins access via equilibrium fluctuations ensemble conformers encoded their 3-dimensional structure; ligand binding essentially shifts population pre-existing conformers favour ligand-bound form
accessibility multiple structures resolved given protein different forms now possible identify principal changes structure assumed given protein upon binding different ligands observed conform those intrinsically accessible protein prior ligand binding
observations suggest dominance proteins' intrinsic dynamics defining modes interactions ligands
contrast induced-fit model where ligand induces change conformation
instead monod-wyman-changeux model allostery where selection amongst those conformers already accessible triggered upon ligand binding
yet choice between intrinsic vs induced dynamics correlations between dynamics function still established presumably depend particular systems study
nmr relaxation experiments provide evidence example existence correlations between time scales large-amplitude conformational motions catalytic turnover ; collective motions low frequency regime appear potentially limiting reaction rates
other hand other studies point different time scales events control catalysis binding events
furthermore while intrinsic dynamics unbound form observed dominant mechanism facilitates protein-protein protein-ligand complexation ligand may also promote structural rearrangements local scale at binding site
given proteins' collective dynamics thereby potential functional motions encoded structure proteins grouped families basis their fold similarities would expected share relevant dynamical features
paramount importance respect clear understanding collective motions their relationship binding catalytic activities if any toward gaining deeper insights into functional mechanisms shared members protein families
protein dynamics explored means all-atom force fields simulations coarse-grained models methods
all-atom simulations molecular dynamics describe conformational fluctuations system over broad range timescales
except small proteins main limitation md timescales computationally attainable do not allow accurate sampling slow large-amplitude motions usually biological interest
cg approaches other hand lack atomic details but provide insights into global movements
among them elastic network models found wide use conjunction normal mode analyses last decade
enms describe protein network nodes usually identified spatial positions c atoms
elastic springs uniform force constant connect nodes simplest enm referred anisotropic network model
despite oversimplified description protein conveyed enms surge studies shown predicted low-frequency modes describe well experimentally observed conformational changes provide insights into potential mechanisms function allostery accord nmas performed more detailed models force fields
additionally recent studies orozco co-workers liu et al point similarities conformational space described low-frequency modes obtained md cg nma provided md runs long enough accurately sample collective motions
present study focuses amino acid kinase family
family comprises following enzymes basis sequence identity structural similarities: n-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase carbamate kinase glutamate-5-kinase ump kinase aspartokinase fosfomycin resistance kinase
rubio co-workers exhaustively studied family proposed shared fold among members likely give rise similar mechanism substrate binding catalysis
nagk most widely studied member family taking into account large amount structural information gathered
enzyme indeed serves structural paradigm aak family studying its structure-encoded dynamics shed light mechanisms shared family members perform their function 
nagk catalyzes phosphorylation nag controlling step arginine biosynthesis
hallmark biosynthetic route bacteria proceeds through n-acetylated intermediates opposed mammals produce non-acetylated intermediates
consequently nagk activity may selectively inhibited taking into account controlling enzyme arginine biosynthesis potential target antibacterial drugs
many organisms nagk phosphorylation controlling step arginine biosynthesis
cases nagk feedback inhibited end product arginine recent studies shed light mechanism inhibition
nagk escherichia coli other hand arginine-insensitive
its mechanism phosphoryl transfer been most thoroughly characterized among enzymes catalyze synthesis acylphosphates
particular crystallographic studies rubio coworkers provided insights into its mechanisms binding catalysis
ecnagk homodimer 258 residues each monomer being folded into sandwich
n-domain each subunit/monomer makes intersubunit contacts hosts nag binding site whereas c-domain binds atp
phosphoryl transfer reaction takes place at interface between two domains within each subunit
kinetic studies show no evidence cooperativity between subunits suggesting dimeric structure provides thermodynamic stability only monomeric fold been evolutionary selected perform catalytic function
diverse crystallographic structures solved bound state enzyme indicate two types functional motions : x-ray structures ecnagk complexed either adp inert atp analogue amppnp too narrow active site let substrates bind directly; whereas unbound structure more open active site
suggests enzyme undergoes conformational closure likely triggered upon nucleotide binding since all complexes display closed structure whether nag bound not
ternary complex adp nag displays ability exchange nag sulphate ion solution without opening active site
nag lid therefore must able open close independently other structural elements
aim present study two-fold
firstly given interest acquiring deeper knowledge enzymatic mechanism ecnagk potential role slow dynamics pre-disposition enzymatic function analyze here low-frequency modes motion ecnagk
secondly using ecnagk paradigm aak family assess what extent slow modes motion shared other members aak family
