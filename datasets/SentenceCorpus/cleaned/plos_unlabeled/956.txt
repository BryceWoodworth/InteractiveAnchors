zidovudine calculated very low mtdna replication termination probability contrast its reported mitochondrial toxicity vitro clinically
therefore azt mitochondrial toxicity likely due mechanism does not involve strand termination mtdna replication
 introduction 
current guidelines highly active anti-retroviral treatment regimens hiv-positive patients recommend two drugs nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class
class currently consists of: stavudine lamivudine zidovudine zalcitabine didanosine abacavir emtricitabine tenofovir
though zalcitabine at time writing still technically approved treatment its distribution united states was discontinued roche 2006
their activated tri-phosphorylated forms each nrti acts nucleotide analog interacting hiv viral reverse transcriptase alternative substrate natural nucleotides
each analogs lacks 3 oh group necessary incorporation next nucleotide thereby terminating viral dna strand elongation
although nrtis effective drugs helped usher hiv into category controllable chronic disease they also often toxic inducing side effects lactic acidosis neuropathy nausea lypodistrophy myopathy patients
intolerance side effects common reason treatment discontinuation
any decrease patient compliance treatment regimen serious concern lead increase viral resistance ultimately treatment failure
first step ameliorating side effects preventing them future antiviral treatments understand mechanisms behind mitochondrial toxicity nrtis use today
discuss below many mechanisms mitochondrial toxicity been proposed
paper specifically consider plausibility currently most widely accepted hypothesis toxicity mechanism class drugs; interference mitochondrial dna replication activated drug
polymerase only polymerase responsible mitochondrial dna replication
while pol not believed directly regulate mtdna levels pathogenic mutations gene polg do affect stability mtdna cause mtdna depletion
polymorphisms found polg gene human population may cause natural variability activity complex enzyme may conceivably play role patient variability nrti drug toxicities
study conducted martin et al approved nrtis were shown inhibit various host dna polymerases
after hiv reverse transcriptase highest affinity nrtis was polymerase
along fact many nrti side-effects resemble symptoms mitochondrial genetic disorders implicated interaction polymerase subsequent depletion mtdna potential cause nrti toxicity giving rise polymerase hypothesis
indeed experiments demonstrated decreased mtdna amounts various tissue types nrti-treated hiv positive patients
addition mtdna depletion was observed parallel cell death mitochondrial morphological changes increased lactate production liver heart neuron skeletal muscle adipose blood cell cultures after incubation different nrtis
possible polymerase dependent toxicity mechanisms comprise polymerase hypothesis direct inhibition polymerase nrti-triphosphate without incorporation into mtdna chain termination mtdna replication following incorporation nrti triphosphate incorporation analog triphosphate into mtdna without chain-termination allowing nrti continue point mutation mtdna 
however there also exists substantial body data not consistent toxicity mechanisms resulting depletion mtdna
martin et al showed no association between inhibition polymerase nrtis mtdna depletion
mitochondrial dysfunction been observed vitro mouse muscle white adipose brain liver heart tissue hepatoma cell lines well cd4 cells after incubation nrtis although no significant decrease mtdna amount was observed
particularly incubation liver skeletal muscle cells ddc ddi d4t azt show higher rate lactate production presence azt but least amount mtdna depletion
clinical settings mtdna depletion been seen parallel normal cytochrome c oxidase activity sign correct mitochondrial function was not associated lipoatrophy
taken together findings indicate weak relationship between mtdna copy number nucleoside analog toxicity
warrants deeper look at data concerning interaction different nrtis polymerase
