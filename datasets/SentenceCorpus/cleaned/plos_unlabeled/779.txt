 introduction 
vast amounts sequence structural data being generated high-throughput technologies
functional annotations uncharacterized sequences structures significantly lagging
time cost experimental techniques required probe function all uncharacterized proteins prohibitive
therefore computational means been increasingly useful popular predicting annotating functions huge amount sequence structure data 
however protein function prediction itself difficult problem formulate since difficult define function
various functional definition schemes been developed over years addressed various aspects protein function
instead adopting existing functional definition scheme proposed probe role individual amino acid residues protein function regardless functional definition schemes used
cases protein function represented simply series quantitative values each indicates functional importance corresponding amino acid residue protein sequence structure
calculate quantitative values each residue used combined approach meta-functional signature takes into account individual scores various function prediction algorithms generates composite score each amino acid residue given protein
currently our signature generation protocol consists following four types scores four different types information: sequence conservation evolutionary conservation structural stability amino acid type
all scores generated via conceptually simple easily implementable algorithms their combined use outperforms sophisticated algorithms use only one source information
sequence conservation one most utilized methods measuring functional importance individual amino acids
amino acid residues more conservative variation patterns usually more important preservation protein function
concept often used identify functional regions proteins building multiple alignments between target sequence all its sequence homologues then analyzing degree sequence conservation among each alignment site
various measures sequence conservation been proposed over years differing complexity sophistication
simplest measures sequence conservation entropy score its variants
more complicated measures incorporate other information amino acid pairwise similarity physicochemical properties theoretical sequence profiles into scoring schemes
al2co program package incorporates nine different scoring schemes but scores tend correlate each other
recently was also shown jensen-shannon divergence measure improves predicting functionally important residues considering conservation sequentially neighboring sites further improves accuracy
previously demonstrated relative entropy measure incorporates amino acid background frequencies better predict functional sites than simple entropy measures
furthermore found incorporating amino acid frequencies estimated hidden markov models further improves performance relative entropy measure
current study use sequence conservation measure derived hmms one component our meta-functional signature generation protocol
addition sequence conservation also incorporate evolutionary conservation information meta-functional signature
many studies shown use phylogenetic relationships among group evolutionarily related sequences help accurate prediction functional sites
evolutionary trace method one first most successful methods analyzes residue variation patterns within between protein subfamilies multiple alignments maps important residues protein structure quantitatively ranks residue importance
further development evolutionary trace method allows quantitative ranking residue importance combining use evolutionary information entropy measures
similarly consurf method constructs phylogenetic relationships group similar sequences calculates conservation score bayesian maximum likelihood method maps conservation information protein surface
further study soyer et al used site-specific evolutionary models assumed different substitution matrix each site detecting protein functional sites
la et al used evolutionary relationships among sequence fragments infer protein functional sites
del sol mesa et al presented several automated methods divide given protein family into subfamilies search residues determine specificity
commonality among all methods sequence relationships analyzed based topology evolutionary tree thus providing additional level information instead relying multiple sequence alignments alone
here propose novel method called state step ratio score measuring evolutionary conservation
based given multiple alignments construct maximum parsimony tree analyze variation patterns root tree leaf tree create score each amino acid residue
ssr score simple yet effective way measuring evolutionary conservation
functional signature scores also derived biophysics-based methods using experimentally determined computationally predicted protein structures
example recent study demonstrated destabilizing regions protein structures often used provide valuable information functional inference functional site identification
given structure given position propose mutate wild-type residue 19 other amino acids calculate their structural stability scores turn used assign score each residue protein
hence scores also serve component protein function prediction
previously developed residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function compiles statistics database experimental structures score pick decoy structures more likely similar experimentally derived structures
rapdf been optimized enhanced recent years protein structure prediction
here further expanded rapdf score residue mutations per-residue basis
each residue given protein was mutated one 19 alternative amino acids producing new structures were further optimized topology maximized stability
our current mfs generation protocol used two rapdf based scoring functions measure how all mutated structures deviate each other how experimentally determined structure differs mutated structures represent potential impact stability position naturally occurring residue respectively
scores separate residues conserved structure versus function
additional component meta-functional signature information type amino acids histidine cysteine more likely located functional sites than other amino acids
however prior probability functional site not explicitly modeled incorporated most current functional site prediction algorithms
our mfs generation protocol used 19 binary variables represent amino acid identity each position given protein
also examined whether explicit use amino acid information opposed implicit use could provide additional information better performance
given complexity defining identifying protein functional sites clearly no single method will always work capture all protein functional site information
therefore several groups begun incorporate information various sources especially structure-derived information give more accurate predictions
work chelliah et al shown distinguishing structural functional constraints amino acid residues leads better prediction protein interaction sites
shown considering both structural functional constraints protein evolution better identify functional sites signatures
recently petrova et al showed integration seven selected sequence structure features into support vector machine framework improve identification catalytic sites
furthermore fischer et al integrated sequence conservation amino acid distribution predicted secondary structure relative solvent accessibility into probability density framework showed at 20 percent sensitivity integrated method leads 10 percent increase precision over non-integrated methods predicting catalytic residues catalytic site atlas pdb site records
youn et al investigated various features discriminating catalytic noncatalytic residues novel structural folds showed measure sequence conservation measure structural conservation degree uniqueness residue's structural environment solvent accessibility residue hydrophobicity best predictors catalytic sites
other similar studies also incorporated dozens hundreds features into machine-learning framework catalytic site identification
altogether previous work suggests great value using several complementary sequence structure components scoring catalytic sites
unlike approaches were largely based machine-learning algorithms current study aim combine several sources information regarding sequence structure evolution type amino acids together via simple logistic regression model function prediction including both catalytic sites binding sites
major advantage regression model each component associated biologically meaningful interpretation individual scores protein manually studied gain additional insights into different aspects protein function not available when many components thrown into sophisticated machine-learning framework
compare mfs approach several other functional site prediction algorithms propose enhancements our approach exemplify wide definition function assessed mfs discuss how different components mfs used understand biological function via four real-world examples
