 
many behavioral phenomena been found spread interpersonally through social networks manner similar infectious diseases
important difference between social contagion traditional infectious diseases however behavioral phenomena acquired non-social mechanisms well through social transmission
introduce novel theoretical framework studying phenomena adapting classic disease model include possibility automatic non-social infection
provide example use framework examining spread obesity framingham heart study network
interaction assumptions model validated using longitudinal network transmission data
find current rate becoming obese 2formula per year increases 0.5 percentage points each obese social contact
rate recovering obesity 4formula per year does not depend number non-obese contacts
model predicts long-term obesity prevalence approximately 42formula used evaluate effect different interventions steady-state obesity
model predictions quantitatively reproduce actual historical time course prevalence obesity
find since 1970s rate recovery obesity remained relatively constant while rates both spontaneous infection transmission steadily increased over time
suggests obesity epidemic may driven increasing rates becoming obese both spontaneously transmissively rather than decreasing rates losing weight
key feature sisa model its ability characterize relative importance social transmission quantitatively comparing rates spontaneous versus contagious infection
provides theoretical framework studying interpersonal spread any state may also arise spontaneously emotions behaviors health states ideas diseases reservoirs
 introduction 
social network effects great importance understanding human behavior
people interact varying number individuals some individuals more than others affects behavior fundamental ways
sociologists long studied social influence through networks networks now routinely appear investigations other fields including economics physics public health scientific publishing
extensive reviews social networks analysis including investigations their structure their effect social dynamics include mitchell wasserman watts rogers jackson smith
networks also long been known important many areas biology including ecological food webs evolution cooperation
social networks also been studied determinants health ranging determining patterns infectious disease spread propagation phenomena emotions smoking cessation obesity suicide altruism anti-social behavior online health forum participation
studies suggest top physical environment social environment also important contributor health
they lead suggestions public health interventions must designed work network structure network exploited spread health related information 
within network studies much work focused how information trends behaviors other entities spread between individuals social networks
processes generally referred contagion
suggestions contagious dynamics possible relevance network structure rigorously examined using mathematical models contagious processes
then used obtain accurate measures expected prevalences interventional efficacy optimized information flow
many previous models been proposed study influential interactions between individuals
most considered well-mixed populations although more recent work focused network-structured populations
most well studied classic epidemiological models spread microbial infectious diseases including spread network-structured populations
various related processes been used model social influence important contributions including same epidemiological models diffusion models statistical mechanics type interactions threshold models 
each models however one more properties problematic studying social contagion
many do not capture probabilistic nature contagion asymmetry inherent traditional infectious disease
others only consider well-mixed populations where everyone influenced everyone else ignoring effect network structure
most models inspired epidemiology not directly applicable social spread other phenomenon because many phenomena spread social contagion may also arise spontaneously
possible adopt trend behavior obtain information outside source without directly catching contact network
other words top probability obtaining infection each infected contact there also non-zero probability automatically obtaining infection independent local network
automatic non-social infection not included traditional infectious disease models
economic models diffusion innovations based early work bass do take into account automatic infection
individuals move susceptible infected state adopting new product idea influenced both social non-social factors
however models do not allow recovery; because innovation adoptions assumed permanent changes behavior individuals never move back susceptible state
results entire population becoming adopters at equilibrium
does not reflect dynamics many phenomena spread socially may repeatedly acquired lost
through balance infection recovery steady-state multiple states individuals coexisting reached
finally most previous models make assumptions about type interaction between individuals particulars not usually validated real data
yet long term behavior model prevention strategies suggests depend critically specifics interaction assumptions
here introduce new model study spread entities social network all important properties listed above
then analyze its characteristics show how applied different contexts
model extension classical infectious disease model combining features other models mentioned above
describes infections contracted both spontaneously through social transmission allows recovery infection
example focus spread obesity framingham heart study network
interaction assumptions model will validated using longitudinal network transmission data
show how quantitatively assess values rate adopting trend spontaneously versus contagion determine extent social transmission important
use predict prevalences intervention effectiveness
results model very different models other interaction assumptions majority rules models
will show transmissive components often small compared automatic component but may still contribute materially prevalence levels
lastly will use pair-wise approximations generate analytic results infections network-structured populations well presenting simulations using real social network
