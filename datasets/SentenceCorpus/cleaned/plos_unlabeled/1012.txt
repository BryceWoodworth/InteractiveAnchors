 introduction 
polymers more specifically proteins show complex behavior at cellular system level e.g protein-protein interaction networks also at individual level where proteins show large degree multistability: single protein fold different conformational states
complex system dynamics protein cannot understood studying its parts isolation instead system must analyzed whole
tools able represent handle information entire picture complex system thus necessary
complex network theory proved powerful tool used seemingly different biologically-related fields study metabolic reactions ecological food webs genetic regulatory systems study protein dynamics
latter context diverse studies analyzed conformational space polymers proteins making use network representations where nodes account polymer conformations
