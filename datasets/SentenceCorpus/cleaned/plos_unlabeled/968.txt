mapability maps our simulations efficiently handle inhomogeneous repeat-containing structure human genome computational complexity practical assembly algorithms
they quantitatively show how combining different read lengths more cost-effective than using one length how optimal mixed sequencing strategy reconstructing large novel svs usually also gives accurate detection snps/indels how paired-end reads improve reconstruction efficiency how adding arrays more efficient than just sequencing disentangling some complex svs
our strategy should facilitate sequencing human genomes at maximum accuracy low cost
 introduction 
human genome comprised approximately 6 billion nucleotides two pairs 23 chromosomes
variations between individuals comprised 6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms 1000 relatively large structural variants 3 kb larger many more smaller svs responsible phenotypic variation among individuals
most large svs due genomic rearrangements few others contain novel sequences not present reference genome
goal personal genomics determine all genetic differences between individuals understand how contribute phenotypic differences individuals
making personal genomics almost reality over past decade development high throughput sequencing technologies enabled sequencing individual genomes
2007 levy et al reported sequencing individual's genome based sanger whole-genome shotgun sequencing followed de novo assembly strategies
wheeler et al 2008 presented another individual's genome sequence constructed 454 sequencing reads comparative genome assembly methods
mean time other new sequencing technologies solexa/illumina sequencing become available individual genome sequencing corresponding specially-designed sequence assembly algorithm designed 
projects algorithms however mostly relied single sequencing technology perform individual re-sequencing thus did not take full advantage all existing experimental technologies
table 1 gives summary characteristics several technologies comparative individual genome sequencing
at one extreme performing long sanger sequencing very deep coverage will lead excellent results at high cost
another performing only inexpensive short illumina sequencing may generate good cost-efficient results snp detection but will not able either unambiguously locate some svs repetitive genomic regions fully reconstruct many large svs
moreover array technologies snp array cgh array at different resolutions also utilized identify svs: snp arrays detect snps directly cgh array able detect kilobase megabase sized copy number variants integrated into sequencing-based sv analysis
thus advantageous consider optimally combining all experimental techniques into individual genome re-sequencing framework design experiment protocols computational algorithms accordingly
due existence reference genome assemblies high similarity between individual's genome reference identification small svs relatively straightforward comparative re-sequencing analysis single split-reads covering small svs
meanwhile although there exist algorithms detect large svs paired-end reads complete reconstruction large sv requires integration reads spanning wide region often involving misleading reads other locations genome
if there were no repeats duplications human genome reconstruction large svs would trivially accomplished de novo assembly high coverage inexpensive short reads around regions
existence repeats duplications human genome however set longer reads will required accurately locate some svs repetitive regions hybrid re-sequencing strategy both comparative de novo approaches will necessary identify genomic rearrangement events deletions translocations also reconstruct large novel insertions individuals
steps thus much harder than others will main focus paper
here present toolbox some representative case studies how optimally combine different experimental technologies individual genome re-sequencing project especially reconstructing large svs so achieve accurate economical sequencing
optimal experimental design should intelligent combination long medium short sequencing technologies also some array technologies cgh
some previous genome sequencing projects already incorporated hybrid approaches using both long medium reads although general problem optimal experimental design not yet been systematically studied
while obvious combining technologies advantageous want quantitatively show potential savings based different integration strategies
also since technologies constantly developing will useful general flexible approach predict outcome integrating different technologies including new ones coming future
following sections will first briefly describe schematic comparative genome re-sequencing framework focusing intrinsically most challenging steps reconstructing large svs then use set semi-realistic simulations representative steps optimize integrated experimental design
since full simulations computationally intractable steps large parameter space combinations different technologies simulations carried out framework combine real genomic data analytical approximations sequencing assembly process
also simulation framework capable incorporating new technologies well adjusting parameters existing ones provide informative guidelines optimal re-sequencing strategies characteristics cost-structures technologies evolve when combining them becomes more important concern
simulation framework downloadable general toolbox guide optimal re-sequencing technology constantly advances
