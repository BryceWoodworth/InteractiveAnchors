 introduction 
genetic interactions logical relationships between genes occur when mutating two more genes combination produces unexpected phenotype
recently rapid screening genetic interactions become feasible using synthetic genetic arrays diploid synthetic lethality analysis microarray
sga pairs gene deletion interest against deletion every other gene genome
growth/no growth phenotype measured over all pairings defines genetic interaction profile gene no growth indicating synthetic-lethal genetic interaction
alternatively all combinations double deletions analyzed among functionally-related group genes
recent variant sga termed e-map made possible measure continuous rates growth varying degrees epistasis
aggravating interactions indicated if growth rate double gene deletion slower than expected while alleviating interactions opposite true 
one popular method analyze genetic interaction data been hierarchically cluster genes using distance between their genetic interaction profiles
clusters genes similar profiles manually searched identify known pathways complexes they contain well any genetic interactions between complexes
approach been applied several large-scale genetic interaction screens yeast including genes involved secretory pathway chromosome organization
segr et al extended basic hierarchical clustering concept monochromaticity genes were merged into same cluster based minimizing number interactions other clusters do not share same classification 
another set methods sought interpret genetic relationships using physical protein-protein interactions
among kelley ideker used physical interactions identify both within-module between-module explanations genetic interactions
both cases modules were detected clusters proteins physically interact each other more often than expected chance
within-module model predicts clusters directly overlap clusters genetic interactions
between-module model predicts genetic interactions run between two physical clusters functionally related
approach was improved ulitsky et al using relaxed definition physical modules
related work zhang et al screened known complexes annotated munich information center protein sequences identify pairs complexes dense genetic interactions between them
one concern above approaches works kelley ulitsky particular they make assumptions about density interactions within between modules not been justified biologically
ideally parameters should learned directly data
second between-module relationships identified separate independent searches network seeded each genetic interaction
local search strategy lead set modules highly overlapping even completely redundant one another
finally genetic interactions assumed binary growth/no growth events while e-map technology now made possible measure continuous values genetic interaction varying degrees epistasis
here present new approach integrating quantitative genetic physical interaction data addresses several shortcomings
interactions analyzed infer set modules set inter-module links module represents protein complex coherent cellular function inter-module links capture functional relationships between modules vary quantitatively strength sign
our approach supervised appropriate pattern physical genetic interactions not predetermined but learned examples known complexes
rather than identify each module independent searches all modules identified simultaneously within single unified map modules inter-module functional relationships
show method outperforms number alternative approaches when applied analyze recent emap study yeast chromosome function identifies numerous new protein complexes protein functional relationships
