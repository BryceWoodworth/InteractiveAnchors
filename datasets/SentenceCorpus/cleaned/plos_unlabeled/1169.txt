equally prevalent event frequently overlooked lineage commitment models upregulation lineage-specific receptors often through lineage-specific transcription factors
here use minimal model combines cell-extrinsic cell-intrinsic elements regulation order understand how both instructive stochastic events inform cell commitment decisions hematopoiesis
our results suggest cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback induce switch-like response external stimuli during multilineage differentiation providing robustness both bipotent committed states while protecting progenitors noise-induced differentiation decommitment
our model provides support both instructive stochastic theories commitment: cell fates ultimately driven lineage-specific transcription factors but cytokine signaling strongly bias lineage commitment regulating inherently noisy cell-fate decisions complex pertinent behaviors ligand-mediated ultrasensitivity robust multistability
simulations further suggest kinetics differentiation mature cell state depend starting progenitor state well route commitment chosen
lastly our model shows good agreement lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics microarray experiments provides computational framework integrate both classical alternative commitment paths hematopoiesis been observed experimentally
 introduction 
multipotent stem cells ability both self-renew differentiate thus sustaining stem cell pool giving rise mature specialized cells respectively
hematopoietic stem cell located adult bone marrow well characterized served popular model system understanding self-renewal lineage commitment differentiation
hscs responsible producing entire repertoire blood cells through process hematopoiesis
during hematopoiesis hscs lose capacity self-renew differentiate into common myeloid progenitors common lymphoid progenitors
multipotent progenitors undergo further lineage-restricted differentiation give rise mature cells via bipotent progenitors
addition classical commitment paradigm hematopoiesis alternative pathways emerging
example also been observed hscs multipotent progenitors bypass canonical intermediate states during commitment
exact molecular events direct lineage commitment at stem cell stage at multipotent progenitor level remain elusive but well appreciated lineage-specific transcription factors cytokine receptors play critical roles
lineage-specific transcription factors been identified master regulators commitment differentiation
they drive expression pertinent lineage-specific genes thereby initiating phenotypic change progenitor cell down specific differentiation path
developmental potency multipotent progenitor reflected co-expression multiple lineage-specific transcription factors at low levels phenomenon known transcriptional priming
promiscuous gene expression pattern progenitor cell necessitates during cell differentiation specific transcription factor upregulated chiefly positive autoregulation other lineage transcription factors downregulated primarily through cross-antagonism 
addition lineage-specific transcription factors cell differentiation also believed tightly regulated cytokines
cytokines signal via their cognate receptors whose cytoplasmic domains activate various pathways involved survival proliferation differentiation
been extensively debated whether cell fate during differentiation stochastic instructive process
stochastic theory claims differential expression lineage-specific transcription factors due intrinsic noise progenitor cells dictates commitment decision whereas instructive theory argues absolute dependence lineage-specific cytokine receptor signals during differentiation shows cell-fate decisions regulated extrinsic growth factor cues
underlying question evoked both theories whether cytokines provide instructive cues select lineage-committed progenitors providing permissive survival proliferation signals
instructive model does not account occurrence certain mature cell types even when their lineage-specific receptors knocked out
predetermined distribution heterogeneous progenitor population into mature cells suggested stochastic model fails explain how specific cell types enriched during stress how homeostasis restored after infections therapy
recent landmark study utilizing bioimaging techniques at single-cell level suggests there validity both theories
authors showed lineage-specific cytokines strongly instruct lineage choice although differentiation was still possible absence lineage-specific cytokines
more comprehensive understanding lineage commitment may emerge analyzing biochemical associations coordinate cell-extrinsic cell-intrinsic events
promiscuous gene expression pattern during differentiation observed not only lineage-specific transcription factors but also lineage-specific receptors
critical commitment signal during differentiation upregulation transcription factor aids expressing lineage-specific genes; however need upregulate lineage-specific receptor event also integral commitment still unclear
particularly confounding since low number lineage-specific receptors present progenitor cell sufficient providing permissive survival cues
during lineage commitment expression cytokine receptor mirrors expression transcription factor often due presence transcription factor binding domains promoter region receptor gene
advantage regulating lineage-specific receptor expression through lineage-specific transcription factor not apparent
recent biochemical evidence also suggests cytokines provide signals functionally activate lineage-specific transcription factors through post-translational modifications also regulate expression transcription factors during cell differentiation 
cell differentiation believed all-or-none switch-like event rather than gradual transition precursor cell stable mature cell
mathematical modeling analysis been successfully used provide insights into biological networks give rise switch-like behaviors
typically networks involved lineage specification seem engender cellular memory through nonintuitive behaviors bistable response profiles
components generate bistability toggling system between two stable steady states include nonlinear feedback loops external noise multi-site covalent modifications
previous lineage commitment models suggested transcriptionally primed multipotent progenitors capable exhibiting bistability purely via cell intrinsic events autoregulation cross-antagonism but models assumed existence cooperative positive feedback loops achieve bistability do not consider role extracellular cues
while cooperativity widely recognized biological mechanism may play important role lineage commitment alternative mechanisms generate similar switch-like behavior networks where cooperativity not been observed
example previously shown cytokine-regulated positive feedback receptor generate robust bistability stimulus without cooperativity deterministic model unilineage commitment
furthermore even networks cooperativity receptor-mediated feedback may provide additional robustness system behavior perhaps more importantly offer external mode regulation cell-fates
here present minimal model integrates bidirectional regulation between lineage-specific cytokines transcription factors previously explored autofeedback loops cross-antagonism understand interplay between cell-extrinsic cell-intrinsic factors fate decisions hematopoietic progenitors
our model shows strength cross-antagonism critical determinant achieving multistability
analyzed network exhibits bilayer memory respect external stimuli provide robustness both bipotent committed states
model suggests noise network enable stochastic switching between stable states; however distribution uncommitted population among various states during differentiation still strongly biased external cues
furthermore modeling framework captures both classical alternative modes lineage commitment seen hematopoiesis
although discrete cell fates likely represent high-dimensional attractors our minimal model may provide initial step towards understanding how extrinsic factors integrate intrinsic factors may elucidate new mechanisms underlie cell-fate decisions
