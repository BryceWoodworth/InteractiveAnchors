 introduction 
pseudomonas putida one best studied species metabolically versatile ubiquitous genus pseudomonads

constraint-based modeling currently only approach enables modeling organism's metabolic transport network at genome-scale
genome-wide constraint-based model consists stoichiometric reconstruction all reactions known act metabolism organism along accompanying set constraints fluxes each reaction system
major advantage approach model does not require knowledge kinetics reactions
models define organism's global metabolic space network structural properties flux distribution potential provide framework navigate through metabolic wiring cell 
through various analysis techniques constraint-based models help predict cellular phenotypes given particular environmental conditions
flux balance analysis one technique relies optimization objective flux while enforcing mass balance all modeled reactions achieve set fluxes consistent maximal output objective function
when biomass sink chosen objective fba output correlated growth model fluxes become predictive growth phenotypes
constraint-based analysis techniques including fba been instrumental elucidating metabolic features variety organisms few cases thus far they been used concrete biotechnology endeavors 
however all previous applications constraint-based approach was used design production biochemical studies addressed only production compounds directly coupled objective function used underlying fba problem
major reason fba-based methods predict zero-valued flux any reaction not directly contributing chosen objective
since production pathways most high-added value bulk compounds operate parallel growth-related metabolism straightforward application fba biocatalytic processes fails useful predictor output
other constraint-based analysis methods extreme pathways elementary modes analysis capable analyzing non-growth related pathways metabolism but due combinatorial explosion inherent numerical resolution methods they could not used so far predict fluxes phenotypes at genome-scale guiding biocatalysis efforts
