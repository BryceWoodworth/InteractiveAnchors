 introduction 
understand brain function essential study collective electrical activity neural circuits
activity typically exhibits intriguing spatiotemporally organized patterns: they commonly observed multi-unit electrophysiological recording eeg local field potential recording meg optical imaging fmri imaging both spontaneous activity evoked responses
space patterns often take form localized patches clusters activity
recordings over large populations neurons shown several localized patterns occur simultaneously across cortical regions
over time patterns often do not remain at specific locations
self-sustained entities they propagate move about space
doing so they interact each other resulting dynamical collective behavior
here will consider what kind functional role behavior may
propagating coherent patterns been registered experimental literature spreading drifting activity traveling waves
simultaneous presence several patterns been observed spontaneous activity cat visual cortex evoked response patterns turtle olfactory bulb visual cortex various species well sensorimotor cortex behaving mice
when several localized moving patterns occur together they likely interact
indeed interactions been shown occur rat somatosensory cortex

despite ubiquity patterns their interactions their fundamental functional role remained unknown
although some authors speculated role propagating waves functional implications other aspects simultaneous presence multiple propagating patterns their interactions remained completely unclear
current theoretical frameworks describe neural activity either computational dynamical systems perspectives
conventional computational theory based manipulation representation static symbols

when dynamical systems theories applied neuroscience prevailing concept stable low-dimensional attractors
notion although provided many important insights less suitable capture functional role brain activity its actual spatiotemporal complexity
need resolve restrictions conventional computation standard dynamical systems theories order describe neural activity understand its fundamental function
study based consideration neural circuits spatially-extended pattern-forming systems containing large numbers simple neurons spatially restricted connectivity
spatially extended physical systems composed large numbers simple interacting elements reaction-diffusion systems fluidic systems localized propagating coherent patterns common feature known under different names including wave packets spots breathers soliton waves amongst others
they emergent collective property systems
using systems analogy construct simple spatially extended neural circuit model represent gross architecture within cerebral cortex
emergent collective property system circuit exhibits dynamical activity patterns reproducing some complexities observed empirical studies
particular circuit provides simultaneous propagation multiple locally coherent patterns their interactions
revealing how their ongoing collective behavior naturally embody computation demonstrate what fundamental function patterns serve
propagating coherent spiking patterns support several essential aspects computational processing
self-sustained objects patterns signal information propagating across neural circuits
information processing computation occurs when they interact specifically collide each other
collectively patterns perform distributed parallel cascaded computational operations thereby enabling neural systems work efficient flexible way
