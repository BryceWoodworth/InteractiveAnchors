 introduction 
electroreceptive fish detect nearby objects processing information contained pattern electric currents through skin
weakly electric fish currents result self-generated field produced electric organ discharge
local transepidermal voltage current density effective stimulus electroreceptors
distribution voltage current sensory surface fish's skin electric image surrounding environment
image brain constructs representation external world
therefore understand electrolocation necessary know image-generation strategy used electrolocating animals
theoretical analysis image generation yielded realistic models predict acceptable accuracy electrosensory stimulus
one general conclusion previous reports skin conductance conductivity difference between internal tissues fish water main factors shaping electric image: seminal paper lissmann machin started long-lasting controversy about roles factors
lissmann machin argued if fish approximately same conductivity water does not appreciably distort perturbing field potential distribution around fish due perturbing field calculated
however several reports indicated internal conductivity freshwater fish high respect surrounding water high conductance internal tissues critical enhancing local eod field well generating centre-surround opposition pattern characterizes electric images coded primary afferents 
experimental studies pulse gymnotids confirmed theoretical predictions showing high conductivity fish body funnels self-generated current perioral region where electrosensory fovea been described basis electroreceptor density variety central representation
funnelling effect enhances stimulus at foveal region
addition two different types skin been described some electric fish family mormyridae: low-conductance mormyromast epithelium where electroreceptors present high-conductance non-mormyromast epithelium where electroreceptors absent
mormyromast epithelium found head front gills well along dorsum back along ventral surface trunk
non-mormyromast epithelium found along sides trunk
heterogeneity skin conductance introduces another factor shaping physical electric images
article describes realistic modelling study effect internal skin conductance electric image generation g petersii
calculated electric image metal object simulated fish having different magnitudes conductances internal tissues skin
while high conductivity fish body enhances electric image combination mechanisms skin conductance appears optimize transcutaneous voltage modulation nearby objects
contrast transcutaneous current increases monotonically skin conductivity
results suggest transcutaneous voltage critical proximal stimulus electroreceptors
