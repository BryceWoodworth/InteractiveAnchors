microarrays typically measure expression across genomic space creating massive matrix co-expression must mined extract only most relevant gene interactions
describe graph theoretical approach extracting co-expressed sets genes based computation cliques
unlike results traditional clustering algorithms cliques not disjoint allow genes assigned multiple sets interacting partners consistent biological reality
graph created thresholding correlation matrix include only correlations most likely signify functional relationships
cliques computed graph correspond sets genes significant edges present between all members set representing potential members common interacting pathways
clique membership used infer function about poorly annotated genes based known functions better-annotated genes they share clique membership
illustrate our method applying microarray data collected spleens mice exposed low-dose ionizing radiation
differential analysis used identify sets genes whose interactions impacted radiation exposure
correlation graph also queried independently clique extract edges impacted radiation
present several examples multiple gene interactions altered radiation exposure thus represent potential molecular pathways mediate radiation response
 introduction 
guilt-by-association assumption genes similar expression patterns participate common cellular functions drives growing body effort extract cellular pathways microarray data
general tenet genes encoding proteins participating common pathway will display correlated expression levels when analyzed at sufficient scale identities known functions genes used highlight existing assimilate new functional pathways
number recent studies validate concept guilt-by-association demonstrating genes co-expressed across multiple conditions more likely represent common functions than would expected chance alone
date computational methods extract patterns lag far behind general agreement about their utility
majority methods extract pathways co-regulation microarray data begin measure similarity e.g euclidean distance pearson's correlation coefficient describes degree expression levels between pairs genes correlated across multiple conditions
matrix correlations across microarray typically representing pairwise similarity expression patterns thousands genes starting point organize genes into clusters
clustering includes wide variety algorithms organizing multivariate data into groups approximately similar expression patterns wealth clustering approaches been proposed
however there several important limitations vast majority clustering algorithms contrast reality biology
first they disjoint requiring gene assigned only one cluster
while simplifies amount data evaluated places artificial limitation biology under study many genes play important roles multiple but distinct pathways
other main problem most measures similarity used clustering algorithms do not permit recognition negative correlations also common equally meaningful
alternative assigning genes clusters correlation matrix thresholded create graph comprised only edges whose weights exceed predefined value
allocco colleagues originally described graphs relevance networks
relevance network both positive negative correlations exceeding specified threshold retained displayed graphically allowing visual recognition highly connected subsets genes
recent studies mined relevance networks extract co-expressed genes cancer cells myopathic muscle biopsies
while those efforts provided gene subsets biological relevance respective conditions they were limited pairwise relationships could extracted manually graphs
relevance networks contain many dense sub-graphs tightly interconnected gene sets intuitively represent greatest potential identifying members common pathways
without systematic means extract aggregate relationships between multiple genes however many most interesting relationships remain embedded within web correlations
developed computational approach exploits graph theoretical algorithms identify comprehensively tightly connected subsets genes present relevance networks
most extreme case sub-graph contains all possible edges between vertices sub-graph structure called clique
terms gene expression clique represents most trusted potential identifying set interacting genes
solving clique however nondeterministic polynomial-complete problem classic graph-theoretic problem its own right
previously developed novel graph algorithms employ vertex cover allow clique solved polynomial time
recently applied algorithms identify cliques co-expressed genes part effort annotate quantitative trait loci associated neural function
here extend algorithms identify differential gene relationships i.e gene-gene interactions induced repressed specific treatment
illustrate our approach using set microarray data was generated spleen mice exposed vivo low-dose ionizing radiation
radiation well known agent dna damage at relatively high but sub-lethal doses
response lower doses however those received medical imaging radiotherapy occupational exposures poorly defined largely dependent upon genetic background
data used herein were derived study explored role genetic susceptibility response ir
