 introduction 
senescence usually treated synonymous aging refers deterioration physiological condition age manifest increase mortality decline fertility
since phenomenon detrimental reproductive success natural selection might expected cause its postponement elimination life history organisms
its apparent ubiquity natural world therefore been treated challenge evolutionary theory
there general acceptance challenge principle been met modern understanding widespread occurrence senescence nature been hailed one great triumphs evolutionary thinking 
discussions evolution senescence broadly follow one two paradigms based either classical population genetics physiological ecology
first emphasizes accumulation late-acting deleterious mutations hypothesized genes age-specific expression
more generally paradigm hypothesizes antagonistic pleiotropy age-specific genes mutations confer fitness benefit early life at cost some deleterious effect later
key insight perspective force selection additive component genetic variance necessarily declines age so early-age cost more strongly selected against than equivalent late-age cost fortiori early-age benefit more than compensates late-age cost
hamilton concludes: organisms reproduce repeatedly senescence expected inevitable consequence working natural selection 
population genetic analysis been challenged recently both theoretically empirically
first declining force selection only guaranteed mutations additive effects been suggested mutations proportional effects force selection need not decline age may more relevant
second hamilton himself concedes: what extent exactly what way life schedules will moulded natural selection depends what sort genetical variation available
thus more genes there more evolutionary pressure there will toward compressed life histories
however despite much empirical work over several decades evidence availability genes necessary age-specific effects appears thin 
contrast classical population genetic approach disposable soma theory based firmly within physiological ecology
thus claimed birth death schedules result action integrated physiological processes concerned optimal partitioning available resources between reproduction somatic maintenance growth
particular there inherent cost reproduction early-age reproductive benefit incurs late-age cost decreased survival possibly form latent damage only unmasked later life
relevant genetic mutations must effects manifest at physiological level
potentially much more constraining paradigm though apparently more strongly supported current evidence
nevertheless given tradeoff between early fecundity longevity again generally been concluded senescence inevitable
particular immortality long been considered theoretically impossible because inevitability senescent aging 
yet understanding evolution senescence fails account organisms showing negligible even negative senescence
species freshwater hydra vulgaris period survival remains constant increases adult age
they include some organisms apparently indefinite lifespans great basin bristlecone pine pinus longaeva continues producing viable cones at well over 4,000 y old quaking aspen populus tremuloides creosote bush larrea tridentata both clonal clusters at least 10,000 y old
other examples recently led reversal traditional perspective problem was explain evolution senescence nonsenescence
contrary given ubiquity senescence nature abundance explanations its presence seems very unlikely majority today's organisms descended nonsenescent ancestors
rather important issue now provide evolutionary account those organisms appear exhibit little no senescence but almost certainly evolved ancestors did exhibit senescence
rising challenge theoretical analysis costs senescent aging shown although senescence often favored high sustained early vitality nonsenescing strategies locally optimal if vitality loss presence senescence would otherwise sufficiently fast
similarly optimization model shown how negative senescence evolve species grow body size throughout their lives if growth carries proportionate benefits increasing reproductive output decreasing mortality
both analyses concerned optimal tradeoff between fecundity mortality so lie within disposable soma paradigm
analyses not modeled density dependence except implicitly limiting case population growth set zero
paper construct explicit models within disposable soma paradigm very general class organisms including those without indefinite somatic growth
reveal density dependence recruitment sufficient driver evolution nonsenescent life histories senescent ancestors
density-limited recruitment sets up balance opposing selective forces underpins direction evolution toward either compressed spread reproductive life
thus one hand future reproduction worth less than present reproduction individual's fitness given future extrinsic mortality risk
other hand future reproduction individual's mature offspring may worth more its inclusive fitness than its own present reproduction if otherwise viable offspring face extrinsic mortality risk before recruitment
crucial advance make prefigured abrams who showed faster senescence favored positive zero density-independent growth also density-dependent adult mortality whereas slower senescence requires density-dependent fecundity
our advance his analysis show how slower senescence take form runaway selection negligible senescence even intrinsic immortality
indeed density-dependent recruitment reflects widely prevailing ecological condition bottom-up regulation crowded habitats
show unwise either ignore represent only implicitly zero population growth because its ubiquity nature its significant consequences evolution senescence
here perform optimization analysis vitality evolution fitness tradeoff between compression into earlier life spread into later life context density-dependent recruitment accords abundant evidence reproduction intrinsically costly survival
populations at recruitment-regulated equilibrium demonstrate generic conditions under natural selection itself increases extrinsic recruitment losses successive genomic invasions increasing level crowding within population
stronger density dependence means fewer recruitment opportunities into adult population therefore natural selection weighted toward maximizing generation length over early-age vitality
positive feedback leads novel result density regulation trigger selection ever-reducing senescence
develop model shows potential runaway selection reduced senescence arise across wide range age-specific vitality profiles including accelerating loss early late onset constant aging
find natural selection favor evolution nonsenescence even immortality senescence presence exogenous mortality without requirement special life-history characteristics increasing intrinsic fecundity age
