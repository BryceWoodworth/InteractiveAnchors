 introduction 
proline trans/cis isomerization takes part several fundamental biological processes including protein folding immune response ion channel gating cellular signalling
process also associated development variety diseases including hiv-1 infection carcinogenesis alzheimer's catalyzed prolyl isomerase enzymes 
best characterized isomerization vivo vitro occurs uncoating recruitment human hiv-1 capsid protein virions catalyzed cyclophilin isomerase
at structural level cypa features helices flanking beta-barrel while ca made several helices connected loops
x-ray structure complex targeted proline-containing backbone unit accommodated hydrophobic pocket cypa
although backbone unit trans conformation x-ray structure nmr studies shown 45 percent conformers cis ca-cypa r55a aqueous solution
rather significant population cis conformers could arise not only replacement r55 ala but also crystal packing forces different temperature conditions along different hydration ionic strength two experiments
free energy calculations further support hypothesis cypa promotes significant population cis conformation
thus cis population likely increase substantially water where 10 percent complex aqueous solution
vitro kinetic measurements show cypa decreases isomerization free energy barrier modified substrate fragments solution 7 kcal/mol
free energy calculations based either classical quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanics 6 aminoacids long substrate fragment point similar trend
addition they suggest h-bonding between backbone unit targeted glycine-proline peptidyl bond n102@cypa well van der waals interactions between substrate cypa hydrophobic pocket stabilize transition state
hypotheses consistent decrease k cat/k m associated polymorphism cyclophilins 102 position f60a f113a h126q cypa mutants
nmr studies along computations further suggested motions several cypa residues linked enzymatic activity
free energy calculations characterized network protein vibrations cypa associated its isomerase activity: flexible loops surface connected active site network hydrogen bonds 
spite great progress describing catalytic process key mechanistic issues need addressed
kinetic studies suggested overall process involves trans cis forms solution complex protein
however studies so far consider mostly ts stabilization
most importantly current proposed mechanism cannot explain plethora molecular biology data
studies show residues not involved ts stabilization proposed mechanisms important function their mutations cause decrease k cat/k m indeed k cat/k m passes 1.6 10 7 m 1 s 1 wild type 1.6 10 4 m 1 s 1 mutating fully conserved r55 residue ala
although mutation was proposed originally destroy h-bond stabilizing uniquely ts h-bond was subsequently ruled out computational works so far no functional role been ascribed r55
addition h54q mutation along i57v polymorphism causes decrease k cat/k m although residues not involved ts stabilization 
here use molecular simulations address issues
calculate free energy associated isomerisation 6 aminoacids long substrate fragment water complex cypa
free energy calculated function two reaction coordinates been suggested describe best energetics process well other pairs different coordinates cross-check our results
use here metadynamics already been employed predict energetics protein/peptide interactions
potential used effective one
choice allows very efficient sampling because its relatively small computational cost
spite its limitations force field expected relatively accurate describe equilibrium conformations key aspect our problem
accuracy force field minima transition states assessed comparing our results first principle quantum chemistry calculations
based comparison find force-field biases energetics minima negligible whereas their influence barriers more significant
therefore here free energy differences between minima used predict relative populations equilibrium conformations whilst calculated barriers only compared at qualitative level discriminate most likely cis/trans isomerisation path
enzyme turns out dramatically stabilize populations one specific cis conformer relative trans ones instead far most stable aqueous solution
addition lowers free energy barrier specific one way isomerization trans cis
findings allow us propose mechanistic hypothesis isomerization process consistent all available experimental data
