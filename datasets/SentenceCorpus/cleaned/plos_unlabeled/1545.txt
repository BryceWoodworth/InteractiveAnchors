 
intrinsically disordered regions serve molecular recognition elements play important role control many cellular processes signaling pathways
useful able predict positions disordered regions protein chains
statistical analysis disordered residues was done considering 34,464 unique protein chains taken pdb database
database 4.95 percent residues disordered
statistics were obtained separately n c-termini well central part protein chain
been shown frequencies occurrence disordered residues 20 types at termini protein chains differ ones middle part protein chain
our systematic analysis disordered regions pdb revealed 109 disordered patterns different lengths
each them disordered occurrences at least five protein chains identity less than 20 percent
vast majority all occurrences each disordered pattern disordered
allows one use library disordered patterns predicting status residue given protein ordered disordered
analyzed occurrence selected patterns three eukaryotic three bacterial proteomes
 introduction 
prediction protein structure function one general directions structural genomics
special interest prediction so-called disordered regions protein chain
disordered regions often play important functional role
should emphasized one type disordered regions structured only when they bind other molecules  under changing conditions biochemical medium but other kinds disordered regions always disordered never become structured
disordered regions protein chains often cause complications upon expression purification crystallization proteins
at present more than 500 proteins disordered regions described disprot database
proteins domains either entirely unstructured native state lengthy disordered regions
at functionally important protein regions proteins outside globular domains i.e just disordered regions 
since disordered regions protein chain play important role protein functioning much attention being paid their examination prediction
indeed been shown disordered proteins certain properties distinguish them proteins well-defined structures
abundance intrinsic disorder pdb was discussed recent study
typically disordered regions low aromatic content high net charge well low sequence complexity high flexibility 
prediction methods aim identify disordered regions through analysis amino acid sequences using mainly physico-chemical properties amino acids evolutionary conservation 
suggested if one same pattern corresponds disordered regions protein structures then highly probable pattern will disordered other proteins
search disordered patterns important task prediction disordered regions search functioning considered motifs
identification essential features within protein domains greatly facilitate their functional characterization
there well established databases protein motif domain information prosite interpro pfam 
creation library disordered patterns one primary tasks respect
there no information about library
until now known pest motif most cases degradation motif rgd motif found extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin fibrinogen prothrombin tenascin thrombospondin vitronectin etc
exposed rgd motif constitutes major recognition site integrin binding 
work been interested stretches disordered residues
rule stretches short loops inside globular domains present only one type disorder because disordered proteins range molten globules chains having no structural preferences whatsoever 2 3 residues several hundreds even thousands residues
analyzed disordered regions created library disordered motifs their positions protein chains entire protein databank
taking into account consideration library disordered patterns will help improving accuracies predictions residues structured unstructured inside given region
moreover our new statistics occurrence unstructured residues will useful those who dealing prediction status residues ordered disordered
combining motif discovery disorder protein segment identification pdb new promising approach further studying understanding functional role obtained patterns different proteomes
question about specificity patterns more important biological functioning
analyzed occurrence obtained patterns some eukaryotic proteomes some bacterial proteomes
