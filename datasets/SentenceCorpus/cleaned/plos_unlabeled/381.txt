several major challenges sequence motif discovery still require consideration: need principled approach partitioning data into target background sets; lack rigorous models exact p-value measuring motif enrichment; need appropriate framework accounting motif multiplicity; tendency many existing methods report presumably significant motifs even when applied randomly generated data

 introduction 
paper examines problem discovering interesting sequence motifs biological sequence data
widely accepted more formal definition task is: given target set background set sequences identify sequence motifs enriched target set compared background set
purpose paper extend formulation make more flexible so enable determination target background set data driven manner
discovery sequences attributes enriched target set compared background set become increasingly useful wide range applications molecular biology research
example discovery dna sequence motifs overabundant set promoter regions co-expressed genes suggest explanation co-expression
another example discovery dna sequences enriched set promoter regions certain transcription factor binds strongly inferred chromatin immuno-precipitation microarray measurements
same principle may extended many other applications discovery genomic elements enriched set highly methylated cpg island sequences 
due its importance task discovering enriched dna subsequences capturing their corresponding motif profile gained much attention literature
any approach motif discovery must address several fundamental issues
first issue way motifs represented
there several strategies motif representation: using k-mer iupac symbols where each represents fixed set possible nucleotides at single position using position weight matrix specifies probability observing each nucleotide at each motif position
both representations assume base position independence
alternatively higher order representations capture positional dependencies been proposed
while representations circumvent position independence assumption they more vulnerable overfitting lack data determining model parameters
method described paper uses k-mer model symbols above iupac
second issue devising motif scoring scheme
many strategies scoring motifs been suggested literature
one simple yet powerful approach uses hypergeometric distribution identifying enriched motif kernels set sequences then expanding motifs using em algorithm
framework described paper natural extension approach
ymf exhaustive search algorithm associates each motif z-score
alignace uses gibbs sampling algorithm finding global sequence alignments produces map score
score internal metric used determine significance alignment
meme uses expectation maximization strategy outputs log-likelihood relative entropy associated each motif
once scoring scheme devised defined motif search space scanned motifs significantly high scores identified
determine statistical significance obtained scores many methods resort simulations ad hoc thresholds
several excellent reviews narrate different strategies motif detection use quantitative benchmarking compare their performance
