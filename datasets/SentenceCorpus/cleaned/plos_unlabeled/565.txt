 
dendrite morphology neuron's anatomical fingerprint neuroscientist's asset unveiling organizational principles brain
however genetic program encoding morphological identity single dendrite remains mystery
order obtain formal understanding dendritic branching studied distributions morphological parameters group four individually identifiable neurons fly visual system
found parameters relating branching topology were similar throughout all cells
only parameters relating area covered dendrite were cell type specific
areas artificial dendrites were grown based optimization principles minimizing amount wiring maximizing synaptic democracy
although same branching rule was used all cells yielded dendritic structures virtually indistinguishable their real counterparts
principles derived fully-automated model-based neuron reconstruction procedure validating artificial branching rule
conclusion suggest genetic program implementing neuronal branching could constant all cells whereas one responsible dendrite spanning field should cell specific
 introduction 
dendrite morphology most prominent feature nerve cells typically used neuroanatomists discriminate classify them
tree-like ramifications represent input region neurons fulfil role complex computational unit
typically dendritic arborizations analyzed descriptive way e.g enumerating local global branching parameters
very little known about general rule leading their distinct appearance partly due wide variety among different neurons
insects same neurons across individuals rather invariant their anatomy constant their function
lobula plate tangential cells fly visual system uniquely identifiable therefore ideal subjects investigating basic rule constraining dendrite formation
they integrate local motion information over array retinotopically arranged columnar elements
accordingly their planar dendritic trees cover area corresponding their distinct primary receptive fields
paper isolate potential fundamental principles may lead morphological identity individual lptcs
