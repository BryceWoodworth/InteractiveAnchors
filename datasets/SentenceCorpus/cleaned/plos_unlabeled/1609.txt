 introduction 
periplasmic binding proteins major components bacterial cell envelope involved nutrient uptake chemotaxis
gram-negative bacteria use pbps transport ligands into cytosol association membrane-bound atp-binding cassette transporter
gram-positive bacteria differ they employ slightly different design pbps motif directly attached membrane-anchored receptor
addition several mammalian receptors contain extracellular ligand binding domains homologous pbps
include glutamate/glycine-gated ion channels nmda receptor; g protein-coupled receptors including metabotropic glutamate gaba-b calcium sensing pheromone receptors; atrial natriuretic peptide-guanylate cyclase receptors
many receptors promising drug targets
structures pbps been called gold mine studying general mechanisms protein-ligand recognition pbps been identified transport large variety substrates including: carbohydrates amino acids vitamins peptides metal ions
affinity pbps diverse substrates also make them ideal templates design diverse vitro vivo biosensors tailored properties 
maltose binding protein part maltose/maltodextrin system escherichia coli responsible uptake efficient catabolism maltodextrins
mbp prototypical member pbp superfamily
been subject extensive study due its importance various biological pathways its utility affinity tag protein expression purification
protein folds into two domains roughly equal size: c terminal domain n terminal domain
two domains connected via short helix two-stranded sheet form interdomain hinge region
like other pbps binding site mbp located interdomain cleft between domains
x-ray structures mbp solved presence absence ligand indicate protein undergoes important conformational change open closed state presence ligand effect better stabilize ligand reducing size cleft
conformational change been dubbed venus fly-trap mechanism due its resemblance traps carnivorous plant closes only when stimulated prey
induced-fit mechanism often invoked describe ligand recognition process
scenario ligand participates remodeling binding site interacting directly protein
alternatively also possible apo protein already exists mixture open closed conformations
case ligand would play more passive role shifting equilibrium toward closed state mechanism traditionally described conformational selection population shift
computer simulations nmr studies often needed distinguish between two scenarios x-ray structures typically do not provide detailed information about ensemble conformations available ligand-free protein 
until recently bulk our understanding mechanism substrate recognition mbp came crystallographic studies indicated only two possible conformations ligand-free open ligand bound closed structure
2007 tang et al reported first nmr paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements apo mbp
attaching spin label ntd ctd apo protein domain hinge-bending motions could studied
measurements indicated existence dynamic equilibrium between major open state minor partially closed state
because experimental pre rates mbp could not explained either x-ray crystal structure apo-state nor ligand-bound closed-state was possible postulate partially closed structure exists
transition between open partially closed state was determined involve rotation around hinge region
best agreement between computed experimental pre residual dipolar coupling data was obtained considering substrate-free mbp exists equilibrium between major open state minor semi-closed state populated 5 percent time corresponds very small energy difference between two states
time-scale exchange between states was estimated between 20 ns 20 s 
theoretical point view understood pre-existing equilibrium between different pbp conformations could play important role facilitating ligand recognition
however remains considerable challenge access using fully atomistic md simulations detailed statistical analysis slow conformational dynamics proteins mediated hinge-bending motions
past decade development increasingly efficient simulation algorithms led large number theoretical studies using molecular dynamics simulations probe intrinsic dynamics pbps
2003 pang et al studied glutamine binding protein using 5 ns md simulations
they observed large vibrations apo protein direction closed structure found open apo structure was more flexible than closed structure
subsequently pang et al confirmed general result performing comparative study different pbps also showed different pbps could display slightly different dynamical properties
authors also observed opening closure rate presence substrate could fast even though they also noted obtaining converged sampling opening closure events was challenging nanosecond time-scale
2006 kandt et al performed longer md simulations btuf protein involved vitamin b 12 uptake
using 12 simulations 30 50 ns each they were able observe initiation opening closing motions both apo holo simulations larger motions apo simulations
behavior protein was interpreted compatible venus fly-trap model
observation enhanced molecular flexibility open state was confirmed other groups similar pbps iron binding proteins fhud fite heme binding proteins shut phut
2009 loeffler kitao studied glnbp open liganded form reported closing events occurring during simulations
taken together md studies pbps helped characterize intrinsic flexibility ligand-free pbps nanosecond time-scale
consensus opinion calculations ligand recognition proceeds through venus flytrap mechanism apo pbps structure very flexible tendency oscillate along modes lead open closed structure
2005 simulation study mbp protein was carried out stockner et al
using 4 md simulations 30 ns started both open closed states without substrate authors could show ligand-free mbp structure naturally evolves toward closed state presence substrate
similarly closed state was found evolve toward open state when substrate was removed
rapid time-scale conformational change was consistent experimental rate constant sugar binding 1 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 suggests rate closure around 30 50 ns
however time-scale simulations was too short observe any pre-existing equilibrium apo mbp between open partially closed conformer
explained presumed slow exchange rate between two conformations apo mbp
paper used accelerated molecular dynamics simulations mbp show apo protein exists dynamical equilibrium between open semi-closed conformation
number methods been developed enhance sampling slow conformational changes proteins including targeted md conformational flooding
however within framework study key advantage amd allows us study conformational behavior dynamics protein without using pre-defined reaction coordinate
previous studies amd been successfully employed study slow time-scale dynamics proteins hiv-protease ubiquitin ikba h-ras
enhanced conformational space sampled amd also been shown significantly improve theoretical prediction experimental nmr observables residual dipolar couplings scalar j-couplings chemical shifts sensitive dynamic averaging micro millisecond time-scale
paper show amd simulations successfully allow study transition open state apo mbp hidden semi-closed conformation
provides first atomistic view transition between open partially closed states pbp
nmr parameters computed simulations agree well experiments
free energy calculations continuum electrostatics calculations used provide new insights into mechanism energetics exchange between open semi-closed states apo mbp
