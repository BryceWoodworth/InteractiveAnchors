 
position determination biological systems often achieved through protein concentration gradients
measuring local concentration protein spatially varying distribution allows measurement position within system
systems work effectively position determination must robust noise
here calculate fundamental limits precision position determination concentration gradients due unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing gradients
focus gradient proteins first-order reaction kinetics
systems type been experimentally characterised both developmental cell biology settings
single gradient show through time-averaging great precision potentially achieved even very low protein copy numbers
second example investigate ability system oppositely directed gradients find its centre
mechanism positional precision close centre improves more slowly increasing averaging time so longer averaging times higher copy numbers required high precision
both single double gradients demonstrate existence optimal length scales gradients precision maximized well analyze how precision depends size concentration-measuring apparatus
results provide fundamental constraints positional precision supplied concentration gradients various contexts including both developmental biology also within single cell
 introduction 
determine position biological system some component within system must nonuniform spatial distribution
often achieved through formation gradients protein concentration
typically gradient forms when protein manufactured/injected within small region subsequently spreads decays
measuring local concentration position relative source determined
developmental biology where gradients used control patterns gene expression gradient proteins called morphogens
however intracellular concentration gradients also thought important organisation inside single cells
gradient mechanism biologically viable position determination must precise therefore robust noise
variability one copy system another will certainly compromise positional precision
production degradation rates vary
physical size system will also vary may affect proper positioning
most previous analyses morphogen gradients focused robustness changes extrinsic factors between different copies system
however there will also intrinsic noise affecting gradient within single copy system example due unavoidably noisy nature biochemical reactions involved
dissection fluctuations into extrinsic intrinsic components mirrors introduced into analysis stochastic gene expression
however here intrinsic noise alters not only overall protein copy numbers but also crucially spatiotemporal protein distribution
even if all extrinsic variation could eliminated intrinsic biochemical noise would still lead fundamental limit precision position determination similar way limits precision protein concentration measurement
paper therefore address question how precisely concentration gradient specify positional information calculate limits positional precision simple but biologically relevant gradient formation mechanism first-order reaction kinetics
quantitative measurements example bicoid hunchback system drosophila shown remarkable positional precision sometimes obtained
reason understanding fundamental limits precision concentration gradients clearly important issue developmental biology
our results will equally relevant gradients form within single cells where protein copy numbers few thousand will lead large density fluctuations
properties intracellular protein gradients been studied brown kholodenko
recently number gradients been observed experimentally both prokaryotic eukaryotic systems
bacterial virulence factor icsa forms polar gradient cell membrane shigella flexneri
mipz caulobacter crescentus forms polar gradients aid division site selection
bacillus subtilis mincd complex also forms polar gradients order direct division site selection mid-plane cell
escherichia coli oscillatory dynamics min proteins creates time-averaged gradient directs cell division placement
using mechanisms sort division site placement bacteria achieve impressive precision 1 percent cell length
cell division eukaryotic cells also believed regulated concentration gradients
example fission yeast protein pom1p forms cortical concentration gradient emanating cell tip thereby restricting cell division protein mid1p cell centre
eukaryotic cells gradients ran hurp proteins aid formation mitotic spindle biasing microtubule growth toward chromosomes
gradients may also play role localization cdc42 activation thereby permitting coupling between cell shape protein activation 
suppose biological system needs identify particular position along its length mid-plane ensure symmetrical cell division
concrete examples mipz mincd complex act displacing essential cell division protein ftsz cell membrane
since concentrations mipz/mincd higher near cell poles ftsz accumulates near cell centre
below some critical threshold mincd mipz concentration enough ftsz will presumably accumulate form division apparatus
locations where concentration gradient crosses thresholds mark positions within cell
our analysis simply postulate existence well-defined critical thresholds where gradient sharply switches downstream signal off
clearly any real gradient cannot act sharp switch reality certain amount smearing inevitable
furthermore there will additional noise process actually measuring concentration due both binding gradient proteins receptor molecules also downstream reactions process incoming signal
general noise output signal processing network written sum contribution noise input signal plus contribution reactions constitute processing network
assume here detector processing network ideal do not add any noise gradient input signal
result our calculated variation constitutes lower bound; any real gradient-signalling system will inevitably lower precision
first considered system single planar morphogen source linear degradation thereby producing exponentially decaying average concentration profile
while model very simple remains biologically relevant both developmental intracellular contexts
gradients bicoid drosophila icsa shigella been quantitatively measured shown fit exponential decay profile average high accuracy
then calculated expected distribution positions where noisy gradient crosses concentration threshold
typical cellular copy numbers few thousand proteins system would unable identify correct threshold position single measurement
achieve reliable position determination concentration must averaged over time
show averaging measurements biological system able achieve precision position determination few percent system size even hundreds protein copies result verified computer simulations
furthermore find precision position determination maximised when particular choice gradient decay length made
also show how precision depends detector size
2-d gradient precision possible after certain averaging time depends only very weakly detector size
relate all results experimental measurements gradients shigella fission yeast
also considered ability gradients two poles identify centre system mipz pom1p gradients discussed above
related designs also been proposed control hunchback positioning drosophila
before find precision system optimised particular choice decay length
however if threshold position set at system centre time-averaging improves precision more slowly than single-source model
subcellular gradients find few thousand copies gradient proteins may therefore required high precision
our results strongly constrain possible concentrations gradient proteins two gradient systems
