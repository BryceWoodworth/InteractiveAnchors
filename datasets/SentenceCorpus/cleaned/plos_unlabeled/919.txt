 introduction 
toll-like receptors group conserved pattern recognition receptors activate processes innate adaptive immunity
recent activity focused characterization tlr network its involvement apoptotic inflammatory innate immune responses
tlr signaling primary contributor inflammatory responses been implicated several diseases including cardiovascular disease
indeed even cases desired inflammatory response excessive activation signaling pathways lead septic shock other serious conditions 
there much interest development methods attenuate modulate tlr signaling targeted fashion
example one approach involves inhibition specific reactions components within tlr network will dampen undesired signaling pathways while not adversely affecting other signaling components
reactions components should ideally highly specific tlr network also one transcription target
therefore available comprehensive data sets tlr network need put into more structured systematic format enables better understanding associated signaling cascades pathways connections other cellular networks
systemic approach necessary achieve ultimate goal mediating effects toll-like receptor signaling upon inflammatory immune apoptotic responses
need particularly important given amount experimental data about tlr signaling already too large analyzed simply viewing complex web overlapping interactions
so far relatively few attempts been made organize plethora experimental data into single unified representation
hence there clearly need investigate function capabilities network using computational model particularly yield further insights into mechanistic action tlrs their immunoadjuvant effects
constraint-based reconstruction analysis methods represent systems approach computational modeling biological networks
briefly all known biochemical transformations particular system collected various data sources listing genomic biochemical physiological data
reconstruction built existing knowledge bottom-up fashion subsequently converted into condition-specific model allowing investigation its functional properties
conversion involves translating reaction list into so-called stoichiometric matrix extracting stoichiometric coefficients substrates products each network reaction placing lower upper bounds network reactions
constraints include mass-balancing thermodynamic considerations reaction rates
additionally environmental constraints applied represent different availabilities medium components
many computational analysis tools been developed including flux balance analysis
fba formalism reconstructed network framed linear programming optimization problem specific objective function maximized minimized
cobra methods well established metabolic networks both reconstruction analysis tools widely used
furthermore methods been successfully applied other important cellular functions transcription translation transcriptional regulation signaling including jak-stat angiogenesis 
study present extended reformulated model tlr network reconstructed based publicly available tlr map cobra approach
signaling networks been analyzed using extreme pathway analysis fba
however since expa analysis becomes computationally challenging large-scale mass-balanced networks could not apply method tlr network
contrast network modularization been established method reducing large-scale networks into more manageable units
another approach reducing network complexity focus input output relationships
used fba simplify mesh network reactions into ten functionally distinct input output pathways show different patterns signal activation control
furthermore used modular representation complex tlr signaling network determine control points network specific dios pathway
control points allow modulation tlr signaling targeted fashion will induce change undesired signaling while not having adverse effect other signaling components
taken together show study how signaling network reconstruction fba used identify potential candidates drug targeting
