study interplay between stochasticity nonlinearity using responses chinese hamster ovary mammalian cells different temperature shocks
experimental data show mean value response cell population described mathematical expression valid large range heat shock conditions
nonlinear stochastic theoretical model was developed explains empirical law mean response
moreover theoretical model predicts specific biological probability distribution responses cell population
prediction was experimentally confirmed measurements at single-cell level
computational approach used study other nonlinear stochastic biological phenomena
 introduction 
complex biological systems built out huge number components
components diverse: dna sequence elements mrna transcription factors etc concentration each component changes over time
one way understand functions complex biological system construct quantitative model interactions present system
interactions usually nonlinear terms concentrations components participate interaction process
example concentration dimer proportional product concentrations molecules dimerise
besides being nonlinear interactions also stochastic
production process molecule not deterministic governed probability rate production
what follows nonlinear stochastic model response heat shocks cho mammalian cells will developed
heat stress just one example many ways molecular system perturbed
general perspective structure molecular system uncovered imposing different perturbations system under study then responses system measured
experimental collection pairs input output signals laws describe system uncovered
fundamental idea systems synthetic biology long proved successful field electronics
input signals applied through use signal generators
input signal easy manipulate heat pulse parameters change being pulse temperature its duration
members stress protein family heat shock protein 70 highly responsive temperature variations
protein molecular chaperone critical component complex genetic network enables organism respond deleterious effects stress
since hsp70 thus important regulator complex system our goal was find if possible develop mathematical model regulation its expression mammalian cells exposed heat shock
our specific objectives were determine equation representing average expression hsp70 over time cell population after initial heat shock determine how physical parameters heat shock influence parameters equation determine mathematical model describes expression hsp70 at single-cell level
first describe process inferring mathematical model experimental data
then mathematical study model will follow
