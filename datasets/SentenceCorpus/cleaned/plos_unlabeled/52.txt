recent years variety studies emerged measuring total chromosomal copy number at increasingly high resolution
similarly loss-of-heterozygosity events been finely mapped using high-throughput genotyping technologies
developed probe-level allele-specific quantitation procedure extracts both copy number allelotype information single nucleotide polymorphism array data arrive at allele-specific copy number across genome
our approach applies expectation-maximization algorithm model derived novel classification snp array probes
method first our knowledge able determine generalized genotype aberrant samples at each snp site infer copy number each parental chromosome across genome
method able determine not just where amplifications deletions occur but also haplotype region being amplified deleted
merit our model general approach demonstrated very precise genotyping normal samples our allele-specific copy number inferences validated using pcr experiments
applying our method collection lung cancer samples able conclude amplification essentially monoallelic would expected under mechanisms currently believed responsible gene amplification
suggests specific parental chromosome may targeted amplification whether because germ line somatic variation

 introduction 
genomic alterations believed major underlying cause cancer
alterations include various types mutations translocations copy number alterations
last category involves chromosomal regions either more than two copies one copy zero copies cell
genes contained amplified regions natural candidates cancer-causing oncogenes while those regions deletion potential tumor-suppressor genes
thus localization alterations cell lines tumor samples central aim cancer research
recent years variety array-based technologies been developed identify classify genomic alterations
studies using technologies typically analyze raw data produce estimates total copy number across genome
however studies ignore individual contributions copy number each chromosome
thus example if region containing heterozygous locus undergoes amplification question allele being amplified generally remains unanswered
amplified allele interest because may been selected amplification because its oncogenic effect
data array-based platforms also been employed identify loss-of-heterozygosity events
studies loh typically inferred occurred where there allelic imbalance tumor sample at same site at matched normal sample heterozygous
complicating issue imbalance may due amplification one alleles rather than deletion other thus loh may not fact present
copy number analysis loh detection both improved combining copy number measurement allelotype data
paper present probe-level allele-specific quantitation procedure infers allele-specific copy numbers 100k single nucleotide polymorphism array data
our algorithm yields highly accurate genotypes at over 100,000 snp sites
also able infer parent-specific copy numbers across genome making use fact pscn locally constant each chromosome
our results also allow distinction made between true loh apparent loh due amplification portion only one chromosomes
pscns 12 lung cancer samples initially analyzed reveal almost exclusively monoallelic amplification genomic dna result subsequently confirm 89 other lung cell lines tumors
monoallelic amplification previously been noted literature single gene level wherein mutant forms known oncogenes amplified while their wild-type counterparts left unaltered
our knowledge phenomenon not previously been described genome-wide scale though proposed mechanisms amplification unequal sister chromatid exchange would suggest monoallelic amplification expected result
addition our ascns identify snp haplotypes being amplified
haplotypes could conceivably serve markers deleterious germ line mutations via linkage disequilibrium
indeed presence monoallelic amplification makes linkage studies statistically tractable
