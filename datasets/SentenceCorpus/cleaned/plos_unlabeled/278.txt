using linear neural network models proved if skills stored distributed representations then within-lifetime learning part skill induce automatic learning remaining parts skill
more importantly shown free-lunch learning responsible accelerated evolution skills when compared networks either cannot benefit fll cannot learn
specifically shown fll accelerates appearance adaptive behaviour both its innate form fll-induced behaviour fll accelerate rate at learned behaviours become innate
 introduction 
both evolution learning may considered different types adaptation
learning occurs within lifetime whereas genetic change occurs across lifetimes
whereas genetic change ensures task executed innately learning permits even most rudimentary innate ability honed into useful skill
environment fluctuates generation generation learning permits innate ability adapted particular physical environment into each generation born
if environment ceases fluctuate then genetic assimilation transform rudimentary innate ability requires much learning into innate skill requires minimal learning
transformation more likely occur if cost learning high case computer simulations suggest learning accelerate rate genetic assimilation via baldwin effect
however if learning sufficiently inexpensive then genetic change may not occur at all
overall there appears tradeoff between learning genetic assimilation learning subsidize genetic change especially if learning inexpensive
all but most primitive organisms learn order survive organisms learn quickly at selective advantage relative those learn slowly
therefore mechanism reduces time required learn given behaviour confers selective advantage
one candidate mechanism fll 
explained below fll ensures process learning one set associations behaviours another set associations usually learned
associations could comprise either perceptual skills motor skills 
before considering how fll accelerate evolution certain types behaviours fll will described its original context spontaneous recovery memory humans neural network models
note fll not unique specific class network architectures although does assume associations learned using form supervised learning
humans fll been demonstrated using task participants learned positions letters nonstandard computer keyboard
after period forgetting participants relearned proportion letter positions
crucially was found relearning induced recovery non-relearned letter positions
more recently set theorems provided formal characterization fll linear neural network models
essence fll occurs neural network models because each association distributed amongst all connection weights between units
after partial forgetting relearning some associations forces all weights closer pre-forgetting values resulting improved performance even non-relearned associations; general proof provided
geometric demonstration fll network two connection weights given figure 1
networks multiple input output units considered without loss generality 
protocol used examine fll neural networks follows
network n input units one output unit n connection weights
network learns set m n associations where 1 2 comprises two subsets 1 2 n 1 n 2 associations respectively
after associations been learned then partially forgotten performance error subset 1 measured
finally only 2 relearned then performance error 1 remeasured
fll occurs if relearning 2 improves performance 1
been proven probability fll approaches unity number weights increases
sake brevity reflected phrases learning 2 usually improves performance 2 paper
