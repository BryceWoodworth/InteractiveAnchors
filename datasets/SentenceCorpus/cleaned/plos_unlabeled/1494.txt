simulations reveal marked asymmetry between subunits
using mutual information correlation measure find subunits substantially more strongly linked quaternary transition than subunits
addition tertiary populations subunits differ substantially subunits showing tendency towards r subunits showing tendency towards t based simulation results present transition pathway coupled quaternary tertiary transitions between r t conformations hb
 introduction 
conformational transitions allosteric proteins fundamental variety biological functions
instance quaternary transitions hemoglobin give rise cooperativity ligand binding therefore drawn extensive ongoing scientific interest over many decades
end points quaternary transition hb referred deoxy t state oxy r state hb characterized low high oxygen affinity respectively cooperativity ligand binding originates dependence quaternary population number liganded subunits
oxygen affinity hb decreases lower ph phenomenon referred alkaline bohr effect
approximately 40 percent bohr effect been attributed protonation terminal his146 residues subunits also denoted hc3 histidines 
stereochemical explanation hb cooperativity characterization transition pathway were originally based hbco deoxyhb crystal structures corresponding r t state respectively
according structures transition mainly described 12 15 rotation 1 1 dimer respect 1 2 dimer
later second quaternary structure liganded hb termed r2 was found 1.1 larger distance between centers mass two subunits compared r structure
differences between r r2 at 1 2 interface triggered still unresolved discussion whether r2 stable intermediate r-r2-t pathway
nmr experiments indicate liganded hb solution equilibrium between r r2 structures
more recently two additional liganded hb structures rr2 r3 were found using high-salt crystallization conditions perutz emphasizing consensus view liganded hb state solution far being reached
rr2 represents intermediate structure between r r2 whereas distance between coms two subunits reduced 3.1 r3 compared r structure
extensive efforts aimed identify transition pathway hb response ligand dissociation
kinetics r t transition after photodissociation co adduct hbco been studied using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques including absorption raman circular dichroism spectroscopy
picture derived experiments suggests multistep r t pathway via several metastable intermediates relaxation rates ranging tens nanoseconds tens microseconds time constant 21 s overall r t quaternary transition
experiments provide extremely valuable insights into kinetics hb but they also bear limitations
they do not directly detect global quaternary transitions but mainly measure formation hydrogen bonds aromatic residues trp37-asp94 tyr42-asp99 h-bonds must interpreted terms conformational transitions
full-atomistic picture r t transition could so far exclusively derived mollusk dimeric hemoglobin using time-resolved x-ray crystallography
experiments provide ensemble-averaged picture whereas hb may follow heterogeneous transition pathways may not fully reflected spectra
furthermore contrast well-studied r t transition little known about kinetics t r transition because transition cannot triggered photolysis
molecular dynamics simulations provide full-atomistic picture hb therefore well suited complement experimental efforts
early md efforts focused photodissociation co were restricted dynamic treatment subset hb residues
ramadas rifkind considered response hb perturbation heme several 100ps time scale mouawad coworkers enforced quaternary transitions within 200ps using technique called path exploration method
addition set md simulation up 6ns were carried out focus mechanism effectors
recently single 45-ns simulation hb was published without observing any conformational transitions
complementary md studies normal mode analysis considered collective motions intrinsic hb tetramer elastic network study suggested t-r2 transition preferential quaternary transition pathway 
so far no spontaneous quaternary tertiary transitions hb were observed during md simulations presumably since previous simulations were restricted too short time scales
here apply extensive md simulations investigate deoxy r r2 t state human
observe first time spontaneous reproducible quaternary transitions hb well tertiary transitions subunits
hence simulations allow one study transition mechanism atomistic detail
find t-r pathway primary quaternary transition pathway
analyzing repeated t-r transitions find marked asymmetry between subunits
based simulation results present schematic mechanism underlying preferential transition pathway between r t states hemoglobin
