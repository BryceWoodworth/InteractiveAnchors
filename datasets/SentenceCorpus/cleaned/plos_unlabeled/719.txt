 
advances time-lapse fluorescence microscopy enabled us directly observe dynamic cellular phenomena
although techniques themselves promoted understanding dynamic cellular functions vast number images acquired generated need automated processing tools extract statistical information
problem underlying analysis time-lapse cell images lack rigorous methods extract morphodynamic properties
here propose algorithm called edge evolution tracking quantify relationship between local morphological changes local fluorescence intensities around cell edge using time-lapse microscopy images
algorithm enables us trace local edge extension contraction defining subdivided edges their corresponding positions successive frames
thus algorithm enables investigation cross-correlations between local morphological changes local intensity fluorescent signals considering time shifts
applying eet fluorescence resonance energy transfer images rho-family gtpases rac1 cdc42 rhoa examined cross-correlation between local area difference gtpase activity
calculated correlations changed time-shifts expected but surprisingly peak correlation coefficients appeared 6 8 min time shift morphological changes preceded rac1 cdc42 activities
our method enables quantification dynamics local morphological change local protein activity statistical investigation relationship between them considering time shifts relationship
thus algorithm extends value time-lapse imaging data better understand dynamics cellular function
 introduction 
cell morphological change key process development homeostasis multicellular organisms
various types morphological change appear during migration differentiation; essential events occurring part processes usually accompany morphologically different phenotypes
therefore cell morphology been used key indicator cell state
high-throughput analyses cell morphodynamic properties been used recently discover new functions specific proteins
moreover outcomes morphological change intricate shape neuronal dendrites remind us morphogenesis itself plays role emergence cellular function 
quantitative approaches helping unveil cellular morphodynamic systems they generating new technical requirements
because cellular morphological change highly dynamic time-lapse imaging necessary understand mechanism cell morphology regulation
progress development fluorescent probes enabled direct observation cell morphological changes and/or localization activity specific proteins but time-lapse imaging highlighted difficulty extracting characteristic information immense number images
nevertheless several approaches context quantitative analysis appeared recently
series studies using quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy instance revealed power computer-assisted high-throughput analysis time-lapse microscopy images: analysis number moving blinking speckles suggested distinct regulation actin reorganization dynamics different intracellular regions 
indeed computational methods been used determine properties morphological dynamics protein activity gene expression
there two major approaches detailed analysis local morphological changes cells
one kymograph widely used method describe motion time-position map morphology time course
time course change intensity could also monitored arranging sequential images specific region interest
although there drawbacks approach restriction analyzed area narrow roi need manually define roi recent studies avoided limitations using polar coordinates explore motility dynamics entire peripheral region round cells
indeed polar coordinate-based approach showed isotropic anisotropic cell expansion examined stochastic transient extension periods periodic contractions
second approach track cellular edge boundaries tracing virtually defined markers
kass terzopoulos introduced active contour model known snakes widely used analyze moving video images applications including biomedicine
example dormann et al used snakes quantify cell motility analyze specific translocation ph domain-containing proteins into leading edge
marker-based tracking advantages quantifying highly motile cell morphology because does not require fixed axis necessary kymograph approach
recently machacek danuser developed elegant framework trace moving edge using marker tracking modified level set method elucidate morphodynamic modes various motile cells fibroblasts epithelial cells keratocytes 
although previous methodologies successfully described specific aspects cellular morphodynamics there remain challenges quantify relationship between morphodynamics signaling events
one representative problem association between regions different frames
scrutinize dynamic relationship between morphological change molecular signaling need cross-correlate them time-dependent manner
polar coordinate system does not ensure association time-shifted local domains unsuitable non-circular cell shapes
virtual marker tracking method satisfies requirement cells broadly consistent shapes but its fixed number markers causes unequal distribution when dramatic shape change persistent growth neurites neurons occurs
taking problems into account perceive need novel quantification method better understand mechanisms morphodynamic regulation molecular signaling
focused rho-family small gtpases rho gtpases signaling molecules associated cell morphodynamics
rho gtpases act binary switches cycling between inactive active states play key roles linking biochemical signaling biophysical cellular behaviors mainly through reorganization actin microtubule cytoskeleton
well known rhoa rac1 cdc42 unique abilities induce specific filamentous actin structures i.e stress fibers lamellipodia filopodia respectively
considerable evidence mainly obtained using constitutively-active dominant-negative mutants supports promotional role rac1 cdc42 inhibitory role rhoa cell protrusion
although some researchers challenged widely-accepted notion variety cell contexts our current study been motivated predominant view
objective study was uncover relationship between spatio-temporal activities rho gtpases morphological changes cells
achieve needed data analysis tool assess link between biochemical signaling biophysical phenomena
however do not focus unveiling orchestration complete signaling pathways regulate cell morphology
addition elucidated how rho gtpases regulate two-dimensional morphological changes cells rather than three-dimensional changes
findings will however meaningful because results compared earlier findings
therefore first present algorithm called edge evolution tracking quantify local morphological change
main features our method identification local morphological change based area difference between two consecutive frames; cell edge not characterized point markers but line segments defined area difference; past history future evolution each segment evaluated connecting segments between consecutive frames
therefore method enables us trace complex cell edge extension contraction while maintaining consistency roi during analysis
second applying eet fluorescence resonance energy transfer time-lapse images three rho gtpases found significant time-shifted cross-correlation between morphological change gtpase activity
our study reveals utility detailed cellular morphodynamic profiling spatio-temporal signal profiling measure time-shifted relationship between morphodynamics protein activity
