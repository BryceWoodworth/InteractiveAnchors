absence noise phasic neurons exhibit class 3 excitability lack repetitive firing steady current injections
time-varying inputs phasic neurons band-pass filters slope detectors because they do not respond inputs containing exclusively low frequencies shallow slopes
however show noisy conditions response properties phasic neuron models distinctly altered
noise enables phasic model encode low-frequency inputs outside response range associated deterministic model
interestingly seemingly stochastic-resonance like effect differs significantly classical sr behavior spiking systems both signal-to-noise ratio temporal response pattern
instead being most sensitive peak subthreshold signal typical classical sr system phasic models most sensitive signal's rising falling phases where slopes steep
finding consistent fact there not absolute input threshold terms amplitude; rather response threshold more properly defined stimulus slope/frequency
call encoding low-frequency signals noise phasic models slope-based sr because noise lower diminish slope threshold ramp stimuli
demonstrate here similar behaviors three mechanistic models class 3 excitability presence slow-varying noise suggest slope-based sr fundamental behavior associated general phasic properties rather than particular biological mechanism
 introduction 
stochastic resonance been extensively described both bi-stable excitable systems classic example noise enhanced processing
briefly sr involves noise facilitating dynamic state transitions threshold crossing while permitting phase-locked response subthreshold signal
interaction signal noise response nonlinearity maximizes signal encoding at nonzero value noise intensity
here characterize novel manner sr-like phenomena occur phasic neuron models
phasic neurons characterized absence repetitive firing steady current injection low-frequency input yet show faithful responses brief pulsatile high-frequency signals
classical sr system often exemplified non-phasic neurons signal detected without noise simply making its amplitude adequately large
contrast deterministic phasic neurons will not respond low-frequency input even if signal amplitude very large making phasic neurons ideal framework study noise-gated coding
convey our insights presenting detailed results phasic model been widely used modeling various auditory brainstem phasic neurons perform precise temporal processing respond only rapid transients coincidences
then examine other types phasic models showing our findings general
class 3 excitability commonly used define phasic responses created different cellular mechanisms recruiting low-threshold potassium current inactivating sodium current steepening activation high-threshold fast potassium current
phasic neuron model our primary focus here hodgkin-huxley type model i klt
combining same phasic neuron model whole-cell recordings medial superior olive gerbil previously shown adding noise enables phasic neurons detect low-frequency inputs alone cause no spiking response
although behavior seems consistent sr fundamentally different sr reasons listed below
classical sr system adding small amount noise subthreshold signal facilitates threshold crossing spike emission upon crossing membrane voltage threshold
when intensity noise properly chosen signal encoded eliciting more spikes around signal's peak fewer spikes around its trough
larger amplitude subthreshold signal better noise-gated encoding becomes; whereas supra-threshold signals noise will only degrade signal encoding
sense call classical sr system amplitude-based stochastic resonance
however discovered phasic mso neurons phasic neuron model responded rising falling trough phases depending spectrum noise but not signal's peak except very large noise
here report essential feature phasic neurons response threshold better defined terms slope rather than amplitude input
further show noise-gated signal encoding sensitive slope signal opposed its amplitude
reason label sr-like phenomena phasic neurons slope-based stochastic resonance 
study highlight novelty phasic neuron's slope-based sr behavior contrasting qualitatively distinct amplitude-based sr coding properties tonic neurons
end first compare dependence signal-to-noise ratio noise intensity obtained tonic model phasic model
addition analyzing snrs pay attention temporal firing patterns often overlooked when sr systems concerned
next show slope-based sr behavior phasic model reflected highly non-monotonic f-i relation compelling feature firing rate falls continuously zero increasing i f-i curves been reported phasic neurons models
finally slope threshold response ramp stimulus observed noise-free conditions reduced diminished addition noise
total report influence noise any noise-assisted coding performed phasic neurons significantly distinct tonic neurons
occurrence class 3 excitability often associated outward currents i.e i klt i kht
far less realized strong inactivation i na also create class 3 excitability
show slope-based sr behavior observed phasic models created manipulating voltage dependency either i kht i na when noise spectrum favors low frequencies
our present study complemented our previous experimental results reveals phasic neurons substantially different behaviors noisy conditions compared their behaviors non-noisy conditions
conventional views phasic neurons being band-pass filters slope detectors all acquired idealized conditions no noise present should re-evaluated noisy conditions
