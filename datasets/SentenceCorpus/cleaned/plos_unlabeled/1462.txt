 
accumulated experimental observations demonstrate protein stability often preserved upon conservative point mutation
contrast less known about effects large sequence structure changes stability particular fold
almost completely unknown degree stability different regions protein generally preserved throughout evolution
work questions addressed through thermodynamic analysis large representative sample protein fold space based remote yet accepted homology
more than 3,000 proteins were computationally analyzed using structural-thermodynamic algorithm corex/best
estimated position-specific stability its component enthalpy entropy were quantitatively compared between all proteins sample according all-vs.-all pairwise structural alignment
was discovered local stabilities homologous pairs were significantly more correlated than those non-homologous pairs indicating local stability was indeed generally conserved throughout evolution
however position-specific enthalpy entropy underlying stability were less correlated suggesting overall regional stability protein was more important than thermodynamic mechanism utilized achieve stability
finally two different types statistically exceptional evolutionary structure-thermodynamic relationships were noted
first many homologous proteins contained regions similar thermodynamics despite localized structure change suggesting thermodynamic mechanism enabling evolutionary fold change
second some homologous proteins extremely similar structures nonetheless exhibited different local stabilities phenomenon previously observed experimentally laboratory
two observations conjunction principal conclusion homologous proteins generally conserved local stability may provide guidance future thermodynamically informed classification protein homology
 introduction 
protein structure function ultimately determined thermodynamics
example anfinsen's seminal work demonstrated native state protein exists at minimum gibbs free energy stability under physiological conditions
binding catalysis also governed free energy: sign magnitude free energy change each functional reaction controls reaction's direction equilibrium extent respectively 
gibbs free energy results summed often opposing contributions enthalpy entropy : g h t s generally case proteins changes free energy small compared underlying enthalpic entropic changes
reactions dominated either enthalpy entropy but most often case sometimes delicate balance between enthalpy entropy controls protein structure function
unfortunately goal thermodynamic characterization protein folds each quantities challenging accurately predict
while enthalpy rationalized terms information derived atomic coordinates entropy harder estimate frequently requiring knowledge not apparent single structure information about conformational degeneracy protein
equally challenging task developing robust analysis reports position-specific stability within protein rather than reporting either: energetic contribution residue stability protein whole 
due part inherent difficulty accurately computing global local enthalpy entropy free energy all protein structure classification strategies aware do not incorporate thermodynamic information
our hypothesis theoretical omission limits complete understanding protein fold space
there may also practical consequences omission
example possible thermodynamic information protein observable independent sequence structure could improve computational tools sequence alignment fold recognition homology detection thereby clarifying discrepancies existing classification schemes based only sequence structure
thermodynamic information may also yield new understanding not available current schemes about evolutionary sequence structure functional relationships
one particularly important yet unanswered question degree protein stability its components conserved during fold evolution: does concept thermodynamic homology meaningfully exist beyond conservative point mutations
step towards integration thermodynamic information into existing protein classification schemes local free energy stability enthalpy entropy here computed large representative database protein domains using previously described corex/best algorithm
importantly diverse proteins studied accepted evolutionary relationships expertly curated any homologs remote
thus experimental design trivial comparisons between thermodynamics closely related proteins explicitly excluded analysis
central aim work assess degree thermodynamic conservation among remotely homologous protein domains
three findings relating thermodynamics protein sequence structure reported
first accordance previous work confirmed homologous proteins exhibit correlated thermodynamic information
second enthalpy entropy less correlated than stability suggesting homologous sequence differences result enthalpic entropic changes largely balance preserve local stability evolved protein compared ancestral one
third based manual inspection structural thermodynamic alignments homologous non-homologous pairs proteins organizational framework postulated guide future integration corex/best thermodynamic information into theories protein fold evolution
