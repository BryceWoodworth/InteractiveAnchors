cells vivo must maintain relatively stable intracellular milieu extracellular environment constantly changing potentially unpredictable

when external stressors cause molecules deviate their basal operating concentrations extended period time normal cell functions become disrupted cell cycle arrest apoptosis may ensue
homeostatic regulation vital intracellular biochemical species appears operate primarily via gene regulatory networks respond specifically particular types physical/chemical insults electrophilic chemicals heat shock hypoxia hyperosmolarity
