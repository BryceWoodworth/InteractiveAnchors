collinear edge detectors v1 instance mutually enhance each other improve perception lines against noisy background
same pre-wiring facilitates line extraction however detrimental when subjects discriminate brightness different line segments
how possible improve one task unsupervised practicing without getting worse other task
classical view perceptual learning practicing modulates feedforward input stream through synaptic modifications onto within v1
however any rewiring v1 would deteriorate other perceptual abilities different trained one
propose general neuronal model showing perceptual learning modulate top-down input v1 task-specific way while feedforward lateral pathways remain intact
consistent biological data model explains how context-dependent brightness discrimination improved top-down recruitment recurrent inhibition top-down induced increase neuronal gain within v1
both top-down modulation inhibition neuronal gain suggested universal features cortical microcircuits enable perceptual learning
 introduction 
since plato's allegory cave kant's critique pure reason often suggested our perception objects outer world never tell us what they really
if men had green glasses place their eyes they would perceive objects green never able tell whether color was intrinsic objects just our perception
contemporary neuroscientific version empiricist's position one may argue perception visual objects always distorted nonlinearities visual pathway particular intrinsic circuitry primary visual cortex
fact any visual input filtered neuronal processing v1 before reaching consciousness
instance collinear edges enhanced intrinsic v1 circuitry our brightness perception will never match physical luminance
nevertheless perceptual training without teacher feedback may still improve our brightness discrimination abilities casting certain doubts about strict empirical view
how then possible reach more veridical perceptions just pure reason i.e intrinsically adapting cortical dynamics without being told about mismatch between percept true physical quality
show model top-down modulation v1 during unsupervised perceptual learning suppress intrinsic nonlinearities v1
top-down suppression leads faithful neuronal representation sensory input
underlying neuronal mechanisms elaborated example brightness discrimination
example flanking light bar closely aligned prolongation test bar acts visual context
flanking bar biases brightness perception test bar
presence flanking bar test bar perceived brighter than actually clearly enhanced brightness perception helpful when extracting collinear line elements against some noisy background
however when task consists comparing brightness test bar displaced single reference bar then collinear flank distorts brightness comparison
brightness test bar overestimated because underlying neuronal population representing test bar within v1 recurrently excited corresponding population representing collinear flanking bar
show top-down input remove contextual bias activating recurrent inhibition within v1
recurrent inhibition cancels lateral excitation linearizes brightness representation test bar allowing faithful perception
additional top-down induced gain increase v1 further enhances sensitivity brightness differences
perceptual learning i.e change perception following sensory experiences typically explained modification either feed-forward synaptic pathway v1 recurrent connections within v1 triggered repeated practicing
because synaptic modifications would affect any input stream through v1 however perceptual learning would inevitably deteriorate information processing other situations
although negative transfer learning other tasks known appear perceptual learning typically task-specific does not deteriorate perception other tasks; see e.g reviews
while improving brightness discrimination between context-modulated test bar displaced reference bar instance edge detection capability expected not suffer
fact mutual enhancement collinear light bars advantageous extracting lines noisy scene required contour integration everyday scenes
hence models perceptual learning explain how improvement one task possible without interference others
intriguing possibility perceptual learning might based modifying task-dependent top-down input sensory areas opposed permanent change bottom-up input stream
taking up idea show how top-down signaling higher cortical area v1 could modify neuronal processing lower area consistent both electrophysiological recordings v1 psychophysical experiments perceptual learning
