 
t-cell antigen receptor repertoire generated through rearrangements v j genes encoding chains
quantification frequency every v-j combination during ontogeny development immune system remain precisely established
addressed issue building model able account v j gene rearrangements during thymus development mice
so developed numerical model whole tra/trd locus based experimental data estimate how v j genes become accessible rearrangements
progressive opening locus v-j gene recombinations modeled through windows accessibility different sizes different speeds progression
furthermore possibility successive secondary v-j rearrangements was included modelling
model points out some unbalanced v-j associations resulting preferential access gene rearrangements non-uniform partition accessibility j genes depending their location locus
model shows 3 4 successive rearrangements sufficient explain use all v j genes locus
finally model provides information both kinetics rearrangements frequencies each v-j associations
model accounts essential features observed rearrangements tra/trd locus may provide reference repertoire v-j combinatorial diversity
 introduction 
functional antigen receptors expressed t lymphocytes generated during ontogeny somatic recombination gene segments coding variable joining constant segments
recombination mechanism largely dependent both accessibility loci rag enzymatic complex
murine tra/trd locus composite encoding tr chains encompassed more than 100 functional v genes
theory each v genes may target one 49 functional j genes
use v j genes during process recombination been widely debated studies support consensus v-j combinations not random use j segments starting at 5 end proceeding 3 end
accessibility j region controlled tr enhancer located at 3 end c gene two promoters: t early located at 5 end j region ii j49 located 15 kb downstream tea
both promoters activated e
e controls all v j associations whereas two promoters required rearrangements j genes situated at 5 end j region
however analyses tea-deleted alleles those blockade tea transcription showed significant alterations j use support hypothesis tea promoter regulate both positively promoters located first 12 kb j genes negatively downstream promoters 
particularity tra locus absence allelic exclusion its ability undergo multiple cycles secondary rearrangements
process successive rearrangements stopped either positive selection downregulates recombinase expression cell death
therefore impact secondary rearrangements tr gene assembly regulation remains defined
regarding v j gene use suggested first v-j association targets secondary one into set j segments located near j segment involved primary rearrangement
rules governing use v genes not been clearly elucidated
nevertheless observations converge consensus: use v segments would progress proximal v genes located near j region towards v genes located distal region
at point time mechanism involved control accessibility v genes remains debate 
current state technology permits analysis some v-j combinations essentially those at extremities locus but still fails establish complete estimation v-j combinations
main obstacle comes fact some v genes duplicated similar copies v region central part making problematic their unambiguous identification molecular methods 
consequently numerical modelling v-j recombination process may offer valuable support overcome difficulty accessing global view tra repertoire
instance if j genes chosen sequential way model their use results unimodal whereas known experimental data tra/trd locus displays two hot spots recombination
discrepancy led us build mathematical model parameterized experimental data all v j genes including those distal proximal central positions
confrontation between data obtained experiments modelling makes possible estimation dynamical parameters accessibility rearrangements frequencies v-j associations giving more accurate estimation tra combinatorial diversity
