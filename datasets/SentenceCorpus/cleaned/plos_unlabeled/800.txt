 introduction 
many proteins assume more than one functional conformation stabilized ligand binding changes environmental conditions
typical example bacterial chaperonin groel widely studied atp-regulated molecular machine member heat shock protein hsp60 family
groel assists unfolding refolding misfolded partially folded proteins
composed two back-to-back stacked rings each containing seven subunits 60 kda
each subunit turn composed three domains equatorial intermediate apical
groel works together co-chaperonin groes
activity groel-groes complex entails series allosteric transitions structure triggered atp binding hydrolysis described figure 1: absence nucleotide binding both rings assume closed state designated t/t state two rings
cooperative binding seven atp molecules subunits one rings hereafter referred cis ring drives conformational change subunits open state thus leading r/t form cis/trans rings
r/t form exposes number hydrophobic residues at apical domains cis ring subunits
groups attract unfolded partially folded peptide encapsulated cylindrical chamber following attachment groes
atp hydrolysis provides energy needed process substrate leads state r /t process terminated upon binding seven atp molecules adjoining ring hence term negative cooperative effect induced atp binding
