 
most mammalian genes able express several splice variants phenomenon known alternative splicing
serious alterations alternative splicing occur cancer tissues leading expression multiple aberrant splice forms
most studies alternative splicing defects focused identification cancer-specific splice variants potential therapeutic targets
here examine instead bulk non-specific transcript isoforms analyze their level disorder using measure uncertainty called shannon's entropy
compare isoform expression entropy normal cancer tissues same anatomical site different classes transcript variations: alternative splicing polyadenylation transcription initiation
whereas alternative initiation polyadenylation show no significant gain loss entropy between normal cancer tissues alternative splicing shows highly significant entropy gains 13 27 cancers studied
entropy gain characterized flattening expression profile normal isoforms correlated level estimated cellular proliferation cancer tissue
interestingly genes present highest entropy gain enriched splicing factors
provide here first quantitative estimate splicing disruption cancer

postulate splicing disorders may develop part splicing alteration key splice factors turn significantly impact multiple target genes
 introduction 
majority mammalian genes produce alternative transcripts part their normal expression program
alternative transcripts include splicing polyadenylation transcription initiation variants expressed differentially different tissues providing fine tuning gene expression required cell differentiation tissue-specific functions
disruptions balance alternative transcripts especially at splicing level known affect angiogenesis cell differentiation invasion
large body evidence established connections between alternative splicing defects cancer so identification transcript isoforms now considered important avenue cancer diagnosis therapy 
disruption splicing isoform expression cancer may result very different underlying genetic events
one hand mutations cis-regulatory sequences lead abnormal expression specific isoforms observed example brca1 gene breast ovarian cancer
another class event includes alterations mrna processing machinery its signalling pathway
may affect splicing specific genes cd44 but may also cause wider perturbations isoform expression processing multiple genes simultaneously affected
evidence wider changes alternative transcription linked cancer present instance est databases where large fraction splice variant actually tumor-specific
however while most studies splicing cancer attempt isolate signature splice variants significant over-expression disease cells no published work date focused bulk splicing disruption potentially arises when splicing machinery impaired
aim present study evaluate extent modalities non-specific alternative transcript disruptions cancer
instead seeking interesting signature isoforms analyzed distribution all isoforms single gene given tissue
postulated tissue where splicing machinery impaired distribution isoforms may more disordered than control tissue
measure level disorder cdna cdna tag libraries borrowed notion entropy information theory
applied measure all three types alternative transcription comparing isoform distributions pairs disease normal tissues
our results show neither alternative polyadenylation nor alternative transcription initiation associated disordered isoform expression
however half cancers studied alternative splicing showed highly significant entropy gain relative corresponding normal tissues
analyze entropy gain discuss its possible causes
