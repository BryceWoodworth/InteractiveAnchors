 introduction 
goal biology understand structure function biochemical networks underpin cellular decision-making
one organizing principle networks inherently modular specific functions ascribed subset proteins network
yet like logic gates electronic circuits even individual proteins perform sophisticated computations integrate multiple inputs
engineering modular approach analysis system scales well size system its complexity
indeed engineers design systems hierarchically modules comprising other modules
if molecular biology similarly modular structures atomic modules larger modules constructed
signalling networks may plausibly ascribe role protein subunits domains
their function elementary modules often depends allosteric transitions: interaction at one site alters structure at distant site via conformational change
indeed allostery increases information-processing ability network because transforms proteins passive substrates dynamic computational elements
modular approach analysis design biochemical networks should therefore explicitly describe computations performed individual allosteric proteins
efforts tackle complexity biochemical networks should also exploit modularity protein structure
protein structure hierarchical given protein often domains also present other proteins repeated subunits
example many signalling proteins contain sh2 pdz domains many receptors ion channels enzymes multimers
genetic networks transcription factors also often multimers common dna-binding domain zinc finger homeobox
re-use protein domains both simplifying confounding feature: once domain been characterized characterization used again but also necessary model molecular cross-talk between signalling pathways contain proteins similar structures
vivo protein interactions generate both combinatorial regulatory complexity
combinatorial complexity explosion number possible species system number proteins interactions system increases
arises because number states module dramatically increases its proteins bind ligands well each other different residues covalently modified
example p53 so-called cellular gatekeeper 37 known modification sites so potentially 2 37 states
thus complete description system potentially requires combinatorially large number chemically distinct species reactions
contrast regulatory complexity combinatorial increase number parameters required describe regulatory interactions within system number interactions increase
complexity arises because strength protein interactions depends state module each state module potentially requires unique set parameters characterize interactions within module other modules network molecules external network
measuring number parameters vivo challenging
rule-based modelling addresses combinatorial complexity allows biologists specify regulatory logic system
examples include bionetgen kappa moleculizer stochsim
rather than explicitly enumerating each species reaction network rule-based model describes system collection biomolecules interacting according set rules
each rule template reaction specifies reactants products all relevant biochemical parameters
thus combinatorially complex systems compactly described because large number distinct reactions subsumed template encoded single rule
algorithm may automatically infer complete reaction network prior simulation if combinatorial complexity too great use alternative techniques simulate system
importantly some rules also specify contextual conditions constrain when interaction occur hence encode regulatory logic network
example rule may allow only doubly phosphorylated map kinase phosphorylate its substrate
rule-based formalisms describe complex biochemical systems but inherently offer little guidance avoiding number methodological problems
first using rules specify regulatory logic system does not address system's regulatory complexity
consider g protein-coupled receptors allosterically couple extracellular ligand-binding site intracellular g protein-binding site
gpcrs promiscuous binding multiple intracellular targets
supposing given gpcr bind one l different drugs endogenous ligands one g different g proteins then principle require lg pair-wise cooperativity parameters describe how each ligand regulates gpcr's affinity each g protein
thus number regulatory parameters scales lg number rules also scales lg because each parameter part rule distinct contextual constraints
promiscuous allosteric proteins therefore require large number rules parameters characterize their interactions
second module should well-described function easily re-used portable between systems but most rule-based formalisms not inherently modular
modellers typically treat proteins black boxes define interactions using biochemical equations
interaction-centric approaches regulation proteins encoded rules ad hoc conditions no longer apply when proteins interact different partners
ad hoc rules obfuscate mechanism underlying allosteric regulation because they do not show explicitly how intrinsic structural thermodynamic properties allosteric proteins generate their functional properties
contrast biomolecule-centric approach would encode regulatory logic proteins themselves
fewer changes rules would then required define how new set interaction partners regulates protein's activity
if model includes protein domains subunits re-use components would also simplified
finally models generated rule-based methods should thermodynamically correct
biochemical networks there often sets reversible reactions connect into closed loop forming thermodynamic cycle
many cycles no free energy consumed: example when proteins bind multiple ligands when ligands bind several conformations protein when ion channels bind multiple agonists closed open desensitized states
thermodynamics imposes mathematical relationship between equilibrium constants all reactions involved cycles: their product must unity
equilibrium constants cannot therefore assigned independently
thermodynamically correct methodology should ensure model satisfies constraint ideally construction
here present modular scalable modelling methodology alleviates regulatory well combinatorial complexity biochemical networks
first describe our modelling framework uses thermodynamically grounded treatment allostery ligands distinguish only conformational state allosteric proteins
also introduce rule-based modelling tool implements our methodology: allosteric network compiler
use anc examine how allostery make macromolecular assembly more efficacious
then show how our modelling framework describes common mechanisms allostery mapping regulatory properties protein onto conformational changes protein itself demonstrate how ease analysis multiple ligands interacting through allosteric protein
next discuss how our approach reduces regulatory complexity thereby increases model's modularity
finally use our framework develop model g protein-coupled receptors whose regulatory complexity scales instead lg consequently greater predictive power
