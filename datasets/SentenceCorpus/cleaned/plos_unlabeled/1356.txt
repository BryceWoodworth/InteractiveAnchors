 introduction 
past decade studies suggested female gender independent risk factor long-qt dependent cardiac arrhythmias
since differences qt intervals males females appear time puberty sex steroid hormone effects cardiac repolarization been implicated
clinical studies found no difference qt interval male female children but shorter qt intervals men versus women under age 50
international long qt syndrome registry 1998 reported females had higher risk first cardiac event between 15 40 years
moreover clinical findings observed more than 68 percent drug-induced torsade de pointes occur women 
known one way sex steroid hormones cause functional physiological changes via transcriptional regulation
sex hormones may bind sex hormone receptors then translocate into nucleus
nucleus ligand-bound sex hormone receptor acts transcription factor binding promoter region genes containing hormone responsive element leading regulation gene expression
example heart lipocalin-type prostaglandli d synthase been found transcriptionally upregulated estradiol estrogen receptor
genomic action requires several hours before effects observed
addition genomic pathway sex steroid hormones may induce rapid activation mitogen-activated protein kinase leading transcription factor activation well activation membrane bound endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
interestingly recent studies demonstrated sex steroid hormones may also act acutely rapidly modulate cardiac ion channel activity directly via pi3k/akt/enos pathway
testosterone induced phosphorylation ser/thr kinase akt enos leads no synthase 3 activation production nitric oxide
no leads s-nitrosylation cysteine residues channel underlying slow delayed rectifier k current
l-type ca 2 current conversely suppressed no via cgmp dependent pathway
regulation i ks i ca,l testosterone dose-dependent leads shortening action potential duration qt intervals
adult men serum testosterone level reported 10 35 nm however circulating levels testosterone begin decline men young 40
qt intervals shorter adult men than adult women until around age 50 suggesting likely role circulating testosterone
females progesterone fluctuates through menstrual cycle
reported serum progesterone level 2.5 nm follicular phase 40.6 nm luteal phase
was recently shown nakamura et al progesterone increases i ks current through no production pathways prevents camp-enhancement i ca,l 
apparent result acute effects progesterone testosterone shorten ventricular repolarization diminish incidence arrhythmias
recently experiments suggested protective effects testosterone against arrhythmia
vivo experiments show orchiectomized male rabbits treated dihydrotestosterone had shorter qt interval apd 90 compared non-dht treated rabbits
also experiments testosterone treated female animals shown dht reduces drug-induced arrhythmia dofetilide 
acute effects estradiol result suppression human ether-a-go-go-related gene underlying rapid delayed rectifier current directly binding channel altering channel kinetics reducing current
kurokawa co-workers showed 17 estradiol increases channel rate closure lessens repolarizing current
they also showed presence e2 herg more sensitive block drugs
group proposed aromatic centroid e2 may responsible increasing sensitivity herg block e4031 via interaction aromatic side chain phe 656 aromatic rings herg blocker
because concentration e2 not constant through menstrual cycle but rather fluctuates peak follicular phase serum e2 level 1 nm 0.7 nm luteal phase e2 dramatic effects sensitivity herg block within range stands reason susceptibility drug-induced arrhythmia herg block may vary through menstrual cycle
although studies shown female hormones estradiol progesterone opposite effects cardiac repolarization: e2 prolongs qt intervals progesterone reduces qt interval question whether normal hormonal fluctuations sufficient account variability qt during menstrual cycle not known
neither effects physiological concentrations hormones arrhythmia susceptibility well understood
some studies do report dynamic fluctuations qt intervals during menstrual cycle related changes susceptibility tdp risk
other studies postmenopausal women also suggest importance female hormones estrogen hormone replacement therapy prolongs qt intervals increases arrhythmia risk
other data not found marked fluctuation qt interval during specific phases menstrual cycle
burke et al found corrected qt interval does not significantly change through menstrual cycle pre-menopausal women; however qt c reduced luteal phase after autonomic blockade
study drug-induced qt prolongation during menstrual cycle observed qt c did not vary during menstrual cycle but qt c shortening was more pronounced luteal phase ibutilide application
nonetheless both clinical experimental data suggest women both longer qt intervals than men more likely develop long-qt dependent arrhythmias tdp arrhythmias
women especially susceptible increased arrhythmia risk response qt-prolongation drugs 
major challenge specifically determine relationship between sex steroid hormones arrhythmia susceptibility males females since cardiac system extraordinarily complex
order attribute risk particular parameter case physiologically relevant concentrations sex steroid hormones specific effect must studied isolation without other perturbations system
strength computational approach employ
present study focus acute effects sex steroid hormones cardiac ion channel targets
use guinea pig models incorporate effects hormones measured experimentally guinea pig then test changes specifically within complex cellular tissue milieu
importantly use model make predictions about effects physiological concentrations sex steroid hormones gender specific cardiac physiology parameters arrhythmia susceptibility
some recent experimental studies investigating functional effects sex hormones cardiac function utilized hormone concentrations micromolar range orders magnitude higher than nanomolar physiological circulating concentration e2
critical consideration because micromolar concentrations e2 apparently cardioprotective via effects l-type ca 2 current
although high hormone concentrations may relevant during phases pregnancy recent study showed e2 at 1 nm did not significant effects i ks i ca,l
our model simulations reproduce observed fluctuations qt through menstrual cycle females both cell tissue-level
simulations also predict effects testosterone progesterone ion channels hasten repolarization protect drug-induced arrhythmias
