report combine resting state functional connectivity mri graph analysis community detection spring-embedding visualization techniques analyze four separate networks defined earlier studies
previously reported find across development trend toward segregation between regions close anatomical space integration between selected regions distant space
generalization earlier trends across multiple networks suggests general developmental principle changes functional connectivity would extend large-scale graph theoretic analyses large-scale brain networks
communities children predominantly arranged anatomical proximity while communities adults predominantly reflect functional relationships defined adult fmri studies
sum over development organization multiple functional networks shifts local anatomical emphasis children more distributed architecture young adults
argue local distributed developmental characterization important implications understanding development neural systems underlying cognition
further graph metrics similar child adult graphs both showing small-world like properties while community detection modularity optimization reveals stable communities within graphs clearly different between young children young adults
observations suggest early school age children adults both relatively efficient systems may solve similar information processing problems divergent ways
 introduction 
mature human brain both structurally functionally specialized discrete areas cerebral cortex perform distinct types information processing
areas organized into functional networks flexibly interact support various cognitive functions
studies development often attempt identify organizing principles guide maturation functional networks

major portion work investigating nature functional human brain development based results functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
examining differences fmri activation profile particular brain region between children adolescents adults developmental trajectory region's involvement cognitive task outlined
experiments been crucial our current understanding typical atypical brain development
addition fmri activation studies relatively new increasingly utilized method resting state functional connectivity mri allows complementary examination functional relationships between regions across development
resting state fcmri based discovery spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations sometimes distant but functionally-related grey matter regions show strong correlations at rest
low frequency bold fluctuations appear relate spontaneous neural activity
effect rs-fcmri evaluates regional interactions occur when subject not performing explicit task
date rs-fcmri been used several domains examine systems-level organization motor memory attention task control systems 
addition because rs-fcmri does not require active engagement behavioral task unburdens experimental design subject compliance training demands
thus rs-fcmri becoming frequently used tool examining changes network structure disease aging across development 
previous work regarding task-level control adults applied rs-fcmri set regions derived fmri meta-analysis included studies control-demanding tasks
analysis revealed brain regions exhibiting different combinations control signals across many tasks grouped into distinct fronto-parietal cingulo-opercular functional networks
based functional activation profiles regions characterized previous fmri study fronto-parietal network appears act shorter timescale initiating adjusting top-down control
contrast cingulo-opercular network operates longer timescale providing set-initiation stable set-maintenance duration task blocks 
along two task control networks set cerebellar regions showing error-related activity across tasks formed separate cerebellar network
adults cerebellar network functionally connected both fronto-parietal cingulo-opercular networks
functional connections may represent pathways involved task level control provide feedback information both control networks 
another functional network one most prominent sets regions examined rs-fcmri default mode network
default mode network was first characterized consistent decrease activity during goal-directed tasks compared baseline
resting-state fcmri analyses repeatedly shown regions along associated medial temporal regions correlated at rest adults
while distinct function default mode network often linked internally directed mental activity notion continues debated
