 
halobacterium salinarum bioenergetically flexible halophilic microorganism generate energy respiration photosynthesis fermentation arginine
previous study using genome-scale metabolic model shown archaeon unexpectedly degrades essential amino acids under aerobic conditions behavior lead termination growth earlier than necessary
here further integratively investigate energy generation nutrient utilization biomass production using extended methodology accounts dynamically changing transport patterns including those arise interactions among supplied metabolites
moreover widen scope our analysis include phototrophic conditions explore interplay between different bioenergetic modes
surprisingly found cells also degrade essential amino acids even during phototropy when energy should already abundant
also found under both conditions considerable amounts nutrients were taken up were neither incorporated into biomass nor used respiratory substrates implying considerable production accumulation several metabolites medium
some likely products forms overflow metabolism
addition our results also show arginine fermentation contrary what typically assumed occurs simultaneously respiration photosynthesis contribute energy levels comparable primary bioenergetic modes if not more
findings portray picture organism takes approach toward growth favors here now even at cost longer-term concerns
believe seemingly greedy behavior exhibited actually consists adaptations organism its natural environments where nutrients not only irregularly available but may altogether absent extended periods may span several years
setting probably predisposed cells grow much possible when conditions become favorable
 introduction 
halobacterium salinarum halophilic archaeon thrives extremely saline environments salt concentrations reaching 4 m higher
organism perhaps most well known its retinal-protein bacteriorhodopsin light-driven proton pump
br only known nonchlorophyll structure allows photosynthesis
currently being developed applications optical security optical data storage holography
accordingly h salinarum's photosynthetic capabilities its most well-studied aspects
example 3d structure br been resolved its complete catalytic cycle elucidated at molecular level
however despite focus br photosynthesis not only means h salinarum generate energy
respiration well fermentation arginine other mechanisms utilized organism
bioenergetic flexibility makes archaeon good model system investigating interplay between different energy production modes
h salinarum also one few reported organisms use potassium gradients long term energy storage battery-like manner 
metabolic network organism reconstructed genomic biochemical physiological data
network consists known hypothesized reactions take place within organism considered genome-scale when most all genes known metabolic function included
previous study reconstructed proposed network halobacterium salinarum
addition immediate information gained metabolic reconstructions networks analyzed gain insights emergent system properties through use appropriate computational methods
respect constraints-based framework emerged important convenient tool modeling systems because does not require detailed information typically required full kinetic models
rather constraints-based models require only generally available physicochemical information stoichiometry reversibility energy balance when available reaction velocities 
one methods available under constraints-based framework flux balance analysis
essentially fba uses linear optimization find flux distribution maximizes particular objective function e.g growth rate atp production
been shown optimality principles within limits under defined conditions describe operation metabolic networks including prediction internal fluxes
extensions fba include hybrid models introduce some degree dynamics through integration time-variant input rates static model 
our aim study two-fold
first set out investigate interplay between energy generation nutrient utilization biomass production under different bioenergetic modes
second also analyzed relationships between different energy producing mechanisms respiration photosynthesis fermentation themselves typically examined individually
achieve used genome-scale metabolic network connects different aspects
our results include several findings contrary assumptions typically made; particularly respect utilization nutrients how bioenergetic modes operate
more methodological perspective also sought out extend existing framework hybrid genome-scale metabolic models handle biological systems where nutrient utilization growth rates vary time
changes nutrient consumption example result differences between growth phases arise interactions between supplied metabolites
demonstrate extended methodology not only accounts dynamics but several instances actually led identification underlying causes
