 introduction 
origin ability generate novelty one main mysteries evolution
pioneers evolutionary theory including baldwin simpson waddington suggested how useful novelty might enhanced physiological adaptations robustness developmental process
early theories were limited lack knowledge molecular mechanisms development
recent decades saw breakthroughs depth understanding molecular developmental biology
many findings were unified theory facilitated variation presented kirschner gerhart addresses following question: how small random genetic changes converted into complex useful innovations
order understand novelty evolution kirschner gerhart integrated observations molecular mechanisms show how current design organism helps determine nature degree future variation
key observation organism its intrinsic construction biases both type amount its phenotypic variation response random genetic mutation
other words organism seems built way small genetic mutations high chance yielding large phenotypic payoff
understand fv important compare related concept evolvability
biological system evolvable if readily acquire novel functions through genetic changes help organism survive reproduce future environments
evolvability composed two aspects: variability: capacity generate new phenotypes fitness: fitness new phenotypes future environments
most studies evolvability focused first aspect variability
studies measured range diversity phenotypic variation generated given mutation usually without discerning between potentially useful phenotypes non-useful ones
fv theory adds previous considerations focusing nature generated variation specifically organism's ability generate novel phenotypes potentially useful
facilitated variation made possible certain features biological design
one existence weak regulatory linkage where general non-instructive signals trigger large pre-prepared responses
example changes growth hormone concentration at localized position trigger large useful changes shape limb driven conserved mechanisms growth bones muscles blood vessels nerves
good example ease changing beak shapes any many possible mutations affect concentration single morphogenic factor
weak regulatory linkage information about output pre-built into regulated system without instruction regulator only selects between states
regulatory organization reduces constraints evolving new regulations generating complex potentially useful phenotypes
additional feature important fv modular design seen example highly conserved body-plan embryo compartmental organization gene regulation signaling networks
modularity helps relieve concern mutation might interfere many different parts organism
properly designed modularity variation within each module generated without harming other modules 
facilitated variation principle studied experimentally example generating mutants scanning types phenotypes generated
example study mutants lac regulatory region indicated shape gene input function channeled directions and-like or-like functions rather than other possibilities 
open question how does fv spontaneously evolve
not clear how selection present environment lead designs increase probability useful changes future environments
how does evolutionary theory account emergence special designs make easy generate novel useful variation
key point our study observation environments nature do not vary randomly but rather seem common rules regularities
specifically environmental goals faced organisms molecules may thought composed combination subgoals
when environments change organisms encounter new goal still made same similar subgoals
example level organism same subgoals digesting food avoiding predation reproducing must fulfilled each new environment but different nuances combinations
level cells same subgoals adhesion signaling must fulfilled each tissue type but different input output signals
level proteins same subgoals enzymatic activity binding other proteins regulatory input domains etc shared many proteins but different combinations each case
one may thus propose many cases different possible environments share language modularity sense they all made certain combinations set subgoals
thus test possibility under patterned varying environments organism learn over many generations language common environments encountered its past
ask whether fv arises systematically varying environments measuring ability simple model systems adapt new previously unseen goals same language past goals
employ two well-studied model systems: combinatorial logic circuits rna secondary structure
find standard experiment setting goal remains constant over time leads highly optimized systems show little fv
contrast fv readily generated under modularly varying goals goals change over time but share same subgoals
find mvg evolution enhances ability generate novel phenotypes long novelty modular: phenotypes novel modules novel combinations modules
show organisms under mvg store information about past goals their genomes evolve weak linkage allows small genetic changes unleash large phenotypic responses do not ruin modular structure organism
our study thus suggests environments change systematic fashion promote evolution facilitated variation leave imprint evolvability properties organisms allowing them generalize new conditions same language past conditions
