 
previous modeling studies identified vaccination coverage level necessary preventing influenza epidemics but not shown whether critical coverage reached
here use computational modeling determine first time whether critical coverage influenza achieved voluntary vaccination
construct novel individual-level model human cognition behavior; individuals characterized two biological attributes they use when making vaccination decisions
couple model population-level model influenza includes vaccination dynamics
coupled models allow individual-level decisions influence influenza epidemiology conversely influenza epidemiology influence individual-level decisions
including effects adaptive decision-making within epidemic model reproduce two essential characteristics influenza epidemiology: annual variation epidemic severity sporadic occurrence severe epidemics
suggest individual-level adaptive decision-making may important causal factor driving influenza epidemiology
find severe epidemics cannot prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives
frequency severe epidemics could reduced if programs provide incentive vaccinated several years free vaccines individuals who pay one year vaccination
magnitude epidemic amelioration will determined number years free vaccination individuals' adaptability decision-making their memory
type incentive program could control epidemics if individuals very adaptable long-term memories
however incentive-based programs provide free vaccination families could increase frequency severe epidemics
conclude incentive-based vaccination programs necessary control influenza but some may detrimental
surprisingly find individuals' memories flexibility adaptive decision-making extremely important factors determining success influenza vaccination programs
finally discuss implication our results controlling pandemics
 introduction 
previously both complex simple models influenza transmission dynamics been analyzed determine what proportion population would need vaccinated prevent influenza epidemics pandemics
however none modeling studies shown whether critical coverage actually reached
here investigate modeling vaccination decisions made individuals whether critical coverage achieved through voluntary vaccination
construct individual-level model human cognition behavior link epidemic model influenza includes vaccination dynamics
assume decision each individual based upon self-interest s/he wishes avoid catching influenza preferably without having vaccinated
since protective immunity against influenza lasts less than one year individuals must decide every year whether not participate voluntary vaccination program
individuals who get vaccinated protect themselves infection but if they do not get vaccinated they may still avoid infection if sufficient numbers their peers get vaccinated
poses yearly dilemma self-interested individual whether vaccination necessary
model each individual's strategy making yearly vaccination decisions adaptive process trial error
track both individual-level decisions population-level variables
use our model address following question: influenza epidemics prevented voluntary vaccination
our individual-level adaptive decision-making model inspired minority game methodology
minority game models how noncommunicating selfish individuals reach collective behavior respect common dilemma under adaptation each one's expectations
past decade minority games been used model inductive reasoning systems financial markets
our constructed model consists population n individuals acting their own self-interest who do not communicate their vaccination decisions each other
every year individuals independently decide whether not get vaccinated against influenza using risk-free highly effective vaccine
assumed vaccine presents no real risk individuals do not perceive any risk vaccination
individuals model characterized two biological attributes they use when making vaccination decisions
individuals adapt their vaccination behavior current season basis their memories consequences their past vaccination decisions: i.e they use cognition make decisions
couple our individual-level model adaptive decision-making model influenza vaccination dynamics
our coupled models show effect individual-level vaccination decisions influenza epidemiology conversely effect influenza epidemiology individual-level vaccination decisions
first use our model assess whether vaccination programs without incentives could achieve critical coverage levels necessary control influenza epidemics
then assess potential epidemiological impact two public heath programs use incentives encourage vaccination
there two major classes incentive-based public health programs investigated our coupled models
first class uses incentives correlate vaccination decisions same individual over many influenza seasons
second class uses incentives correlate vaccination decisions amongst individuals population one influenza season
many additional incentive-based vaccination programs formulated combining defining characteristics two classes
first public health program investigate example first class incentive-based programs
program offers free vaccination y number years individual who pays vaccination first year
assume individual gets vaccinated each year during y years free vaccination but s/he also evaluates necessity vaccination every year
at end y years each individual program then uses their evaluations decide whether not re-enroll program
if they choose re-enroll they pay vaccination season receive free vaccinations further y years
second public health program analyze example second class incentive-based programs
program vaccinates family free if head family pays her/his own vaccination
assume head family decides every year whether re-enroll program depending upon how many her/his family members were infected previous season
