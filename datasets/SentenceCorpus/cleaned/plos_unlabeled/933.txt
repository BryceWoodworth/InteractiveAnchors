 introduction 
development function prediction capabilities major challenge genomics
structural genomics projects determining 3d structures expressed proteins high throughput basis
however determination function 3d structure proved challenging task; functions most structural genomics proteins remain unknown
computationally based predictive methods help guide accelerate functional annotation
first step toward prediction function protein its 3d structure determine its local site interaction where catalysis and/or ligand recognition occurs
capabilities many important practical implications biology medicine
reported thematics theoretical microscopic titration curves technique prediction local interaction sites protein its three-dimensional structure alone
application thematics one begins 3d structure query protein solves poisson-boltzmann equations using well-established methods then performs hybrid procedure compute proton occupations ionizable sites functions ph
residues involved catalysis and/or recognition different chemical properties ordinary residues
particular functionally important residues anomalous theoretical proton occupation curves
thematics exploits difference utilizes information shapes theoretical titration curves ionizable residues calculated approximately computed electrical potential function
thematics utilizes only 3d structure query protein input; neither sequence alignments nor structural comparisons used
recently was shown among methods based 3d structure query protein only thematics achieves far best performance measured sensitivity precision annotated catalytic residues
purpose present paper five-fold: present monotonicity-constrained maximum likelihood approach called partial order optimum likelihood improve performance expand capabilities active site prediction
then shown pool thematics input data alone outperforms previous statistical support vector machine implementations thematics when applied test set annotated protein structures
then demonstrated inclusion one additional 3d-structure-based feature representing ordinal size surface cleft each residue belongs result some improved performance demonstrated roc curves validated wilcoxon signed-rank tests
introduction environment features pool then use thematics data predict both ionizable non-ionizable residues
all-residues extension thematics together cleft size rank feature results simple 3d-structure-based functional site predictor performs better than other 3d structure based methods nearly well very best current methods utilize both 3d structure sequence homology
finally pool approach able take advantage sequence alignment-based conservation scores when available addition structure-based features
when additional information included resulting classifier shown outperform all other currently available methods using any combination structure sequence information
prior implementations thematics identification active-site residues 3d structure query protein titration curve shapes were described moments their first derivative functions
first derivative functions essentially probability density functions give unity when integrated over all space
ko et al third fourth central moments 3 4 probability functions were used
moments measure asymmetry roughly area under tails relative area near mean respectively
tong et al first moment second central moment were also used
each approaches moments measure deviations normal curve shape analyses identify outliers residues deviate most normal proton occupation behavior
prior approaches all use spatial clustering so outlier residues reported positive method if only if they sufficiently close spatial proximity at least one other outlier
thus previous thematics identifications involve two stages where first stage makes binary decision each residue second stage finds spatial clusters outliers
new approach reported here every residue assigned probability active-site residue
here alternative clustering approach introduce features describe residue's neighbors; call environment features
given scalar feature x define value environment feature x env given residue r be:formulawhere r ionizable residue whose distance d residue r less than 9 weight w given 1/d 2
study use same features 3 4 used ko approach along additional features 3 env 4 env
thus every ionizable residue any protein structure assigned 4-dimensional feature vector
present approach number advantages
specifically active residues may selected one step they rank-ordered according probability involvement active site
furthermore while thematics previously been applied ionizable residues only present approach opens door direct prediction non-ionizable active site residues because environment features 3 env 4 env well defined all residues including non-ionizable ones
finally additional geometric features obtainable 3d structure only may readily combined four thematics features order enhance performance
geometric features relative sizes clefts surface protein structure been shown correlate active site location
instance majority single-chain proteins catalytic residues largest cleft
however geometric features alone do not perform comparatively well active residue prediction particularly because they not very selective
shown here cleft size information combined thematics electrostatic features yields high performance purely 3d structure based functional site predictions
