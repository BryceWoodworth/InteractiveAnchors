 
whole-genome transporter analyses been conducted 141 organisms whose complete genome sequences available
each organism complete set membrane transport systems was identified predicted functions classified into protein families based transporter classification system
organisms larger genome sizes generally possessed relatively greater number transport systems
prokaryotes unicellular eukaryotes significant factor increase transporter content genome size was greater diversity transporter types
contrast multicellular eukaryotes greater number paralogs specific transporter families was more important factor increase transporter content genome size
both eukaryotic prokaryotic intracellular pathogens endosymbionts exhibited markedly limited transport capabilities
hierarchical clustering phylogenetic profiles transporter families derived presence absence certain transporter family showed clustering patterns organisms were correlated both their evolutionary history their overall physiology lifestyles
 introduction 
membrane transport systems play essential roles cellular metabolism activities
transporters function acquisition organic nutrients maintenance ion homeostasis extrusion toxic waste compounds environmental sensing cell communication other important cellular functions
various transport systems differ their putative membrane topology energy coupling mechanisms substrate specificities
among prevailing energy sources adenosine triphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate chemiosmotic energy form sodium ion proton electrochemical gradients
transporter classification system represents systematic approach classify transport systems according their mode transport energy coupling mechanism molecular phylogeny substrate specificity
transport mode energy coupling mechanism serve primary basis classification because their relatively stable characteristics
there four major classes solute transporters transporter classification system: channels primary transporters secondary transporters group translocators
transporters unknown mechanism function included distinct class
channels energy-independent transporters transport water specific types ions hydrophilic small molecules down concentration electrical gradient; they higher rates transport lower stereospecificity than other transporter classes
primary active transporters couple transport process primary source energy
secondary transporters utilize ion solute electrochemical gradient e.g proton/sodium motive force drive transport process
e coli lacy lactose permease probably one best characterized secondary transporters
group translocators modify their substrates during transport process
example e coli mtla mannitol pts transporter phosphorylates exogenous mannitol using phosphoenolpyruvate phosphoryl donor energy source releases phosphate ester mannitol-1-p into cell cytoplasm
each transporter class further classified into individual families subfamilies according their function phylogeny and/or substrate specificity 
since advent genomic sequencing technologies complete sequences over 200 prokaryotic eukaryotic genomes been published date representing wide range species archaea human
there also more than 1,100 additional genome sequencing projects currently underway around world
convenient effective computational methods required handle analyze immense amount data generated whole-genome sequencing projects
in-depth look at transport proteins vital understanding metabolic capability sequenced organisms
however often problematic annotate transport proteins current primary annotation methods because occurrence large complex transporter gene families atp-binding cassette superfamily major facilitator superfamily presence multiple transporter gene paralogs many organisms
been working systematic genome-wide analysis cellular membrane transport systems
previously reported comprehensive analysis transport systems 18 prokaryotic organisms yeast
here expand our analyses 141 species compare fundamental differences membrane transport systems prokaryotes eukaryotes
