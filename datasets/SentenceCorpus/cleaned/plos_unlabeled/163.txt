 
developed software program weights integrates specific properties genes pathogen so they may ranked drug targets
applied software produce three prioritized drug target lists mycobacterium tuberculosis causative agent tuberculosis disease new drug desperately needed
each list based individual criterion
first list prioritizes metabolic drug targets uniqueness their roles m tuberculosis metabolome their similarity known druggable protein classes
second list prioritizes targets would specifically impair m tuberculosis weighting heavily those closely conserved within actinobacteria class but lack close homology host gut flora
m tuberculosis survive asymptomatically its host many years adapting dormant state referred persistence
final list aims prioritize potential targets involved maintaining persistence m tuberculosis
rankings current candidate proposed drug targets highlighted respect lists
some features were found more accurate than others prioritizing studied targets
also shown targets prioritized using evolutionary programming optimize weights each desired property
demonstrate approach prioritizing persistence targets
 introduction 
cost research development pharmaceutical industry been rising steeply steadily last decade but amount time required bring new product market remains around ten fifteen years
problem been labeled innovation gap necessitates investment inexpensive technologies shorten length time spent drug discovery
target identification stage first step drug discovery process provide foundation years dedicated research pharmaceutical industry
all other steps drug discovery stage complicated fact identified drug target must satisfy variety criteria permit progression next stage
important factors context include homology between target host ; activity target diseased state ; essentiality target pathogen's growth survival 
values some selection criteria found easily querying publicly available bioinformatics resources including metabolic pathway databases kegg protein classification sets cogs databases druggable proteins 
traditional prioritization approaches literature searches mental integration multiple criteria quickly become overwhelming researcher
more effective alternative computational integration over different criteria create ranking function
article describe application assessdrugtarget ranks genes genome according given set weighted criteria
