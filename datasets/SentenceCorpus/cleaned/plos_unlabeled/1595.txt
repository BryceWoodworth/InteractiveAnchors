physiological interpretation model suggests considerable fraction vsd signal may due inhibitory activity supporting notion balanced intra-layer cortical interactions between inhibitory excitatory populations play major role shaping dynamic stimulus representations early visual cortex
 introduction 
visual cortical activity does not exclusively mirror visual input but rather reflects contribution additional recurrent processes involving lateral local feedback couplings
understanding cortical processing requires theoretical understanding underlying activity dynamics attained modeling at various levels abstraction
naturally chosen level should match level at neuronal recordings made
activity patterns observed using voltage-sensitive dye imaging reflect population activity at mesoscopic level
suggests application mean-field models large numbers neurons averaged
moreover interested relation neuronal dynamics spatial dimensions cortical sheet
neural field models efficacy synaptic coupling depends notion distance between neurons ensembles neurons therefore our preferred choice
here show minimalistic multiple-layer nf models simulate mean vsd data space time high accuracy
model functional description vsd-recorded dynamics
thus first place phenomenological
however its interpretation biological terms allows link its structure parameters neuronal functional architecture
imaging data model showed: two stationary stimuli presented rapid succession produce pattern signals propagation activity across bar's retinotopic representation early visual cortex
ii obtained pattern was different activity when bar was flashed alone did not match simple superposition activities evoked individually-presented square bar stimuli
iii rather observed propagation wave front activity was also found when square stimulus moved physically visual space 
based vsd imaging data hypothesized two-layer neural field model account findings i iii
if so would imply feedback higher brain areas not principal requirement produce motion patterns across primary visual cortex upon presentation square bar flashed rapid succession 
voltage sensitive dye imaging measures relative fluorescence changes linearly correlated changes membrane potentials
technique currently allows recording vivo cortical activity at sub well suprathreshold level at least 10 ms temporal resolution spatial resolution 50 formulam across several millimeters cortex
hence well suited capture real-time dynamics millions neurons at once
however signal does not distinguish between excitatory inhibitory contributions overall activity
therefore our model explicitly assumes vsd signal reflects mixture activity excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations thus contrasts studies interpret vsd data mainly reflecting excitatory activity
expect gain insights about relative contributions excitatory inhibitory activities vsd signal because model allows separate inspection its inhibitory excitatory layers
following first describe underlying data its preprocessing our model structure our parameter identification procedure
then present results including model fit comparison further simplified models model prediction regarding similar yet novel stimuli results standard linear stability analysis homogeneous solution model
then follow discussion findings relation alternative modeling approaches physiological interpretation our model role excitation inhibition model
finally consider our results context hypotheses concerning cortical representation motion origin line-motion illusion
