technique particularly useful detecting copy-neutral rearrangements inversions translocations common cancer produce novel fusion genes
address question how much sequencing required detect rearrangement breakpoints localize them precisely using both theoretical models simulation
derive formula probability fusion gene exists cancer genome given collection paired-end sequences genome
use formula compute fusion gene probabilities several breast cancer samples find able accurately predict fusion genes samples relatively small number fragments large size
further demonstrate how ability detect fusion genes depends distribution gene lengths evaluate how different parameters sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection breakpoint localization fusion gene detection even presence errors suggest false rearrangements
results will useful calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts particularly large-scale studies many cancer genomes enabled next-generation sequencing technologies
 introduction 
cancer disease driven selection somatic mutations
mutations range single nucleotide changes large-scale chromosomal aberrations deletion duplications inversions translocations
while many mutations been cataloged cancer cells via cytogenetics gene resequencing array-based techniques there now great interest using genome sequencing provide comprehensive understanding mutations cancer genomes
cancer genome atlas one sequencing initiative focuses sequencing efforts pilot phase point mutations coding regions
approach largely ignores copy neutral genome rearrangements including translocations inversions
rearrangements create novel fusion genes observed leukemias lymphomas sarcomas
canonical example fusion gene bcr-abl results characteristic translocation many patients chronic myelogenous leukemia
advent gleevec drug targeted bcr-abl fusion gene proven successful treatment cml patients invigorating search other fusion genes might provide tumor-specific biomarkers drug targets
until recently was generally believed recurrent translocations their resulting fusion genes occurred only hematological disorders sarcomas few suggesting recurrent events were prevalent across all tumor types including solid tumors
view been challenged discovery fusion between tmprss2 gene several members erg protein family prostate cancer eml4-alk fusion lung cancer 
studies raise question what other recurrent rearrangements remain discovered
one strategy genome-wide high-resolution identification fusion genes other large scale rearrangements paired-end sequencing clones other fragments genomic dna tumor samples
resulting end-sequence pairs paired reads mapped back reference human genome sequence
if mapped locations ends clone invalid then genomic rearrangement suggested
strategy was initially described end sequence profiling approach later used assess genetic structural variation
innovative approach utilizing sage-like sequencing concatenated short paired-end tags successfully identified fusion transcripts cdna libraries
present forthcoming next-generation dna sequencers hold promise extremely high-throughput sequencing paired-end reads
example illumina genome analyzer will soon able produce millions paired reads approximately 30 bp fragments length 500 1000 bp while solid system applied biosystems promises 25 bp reads each end size selected dna fragments many sizes
similar strategies coupling generation paired-end tags 454 sequencing also been described 
whole genome paired-end sequencing approaches allow genome-wide survey all potential fusion genes other rearrangements tumor
approach holds several advantages over transcript protein profiling cancer studies
first discovery fusion genes using mrna expression cdna sequencing mass spectrometry depends fusion genes being transcribed under specific cellular conditions present sample at time assay
conditions might different than those experienced cells during tumor development
second measurement fusions at dna sequence level focuses gene fusions due genomic rearrangements thus less impeded splicing artifacts trans splicing
finally genome sequencing identify more subtle regulatory fusions result when promoter one gene fused coding region another gene case c-myc oncogene fusion immunoglobin gene promoter burkitt's lymphoma 
paper address number theoretical practical considerations assessing cancer genome organization using paired-end sequencing approaches
largely concerned detecting rearrangement breakpoint where pair non-adjacent coordinates reference genome adjacent cancer genome
particular extend idea breakpoint examine ability detect fusion genes
specifically if clone end sequences mapping distant locations identifies rearrangement cancer genome does rearrangement lead formation fusion gene
obviously sequencing clone will answer question but requires additional effort/cost may problematic; e.g most next-generation sequencing technologies do not archive genome clone library later analysis
derive formula probability fusion between pair genomic regions given set all mapped clones empirical distribution clone lengths
probabilities useful prioritizing follow-up experiments validate fusion genes
test experiment mcf7 breast cancer cell-line 3,201 pairs genes were found near clones aberrantly mapping end-sequences
however our analysis revealed only 18 pairs genes high probability fusion six were tested five experimentally confirmed 
advent high throughput sequencing strategies raises important experimental design questions using technologies understand cancer genome organization
obviously sequencing more clones improves probability detecting fusion genes breakpoints
however even latest sequencing technologies would neither practical nor cost effective shotgun sequence assemble genomes thousands tumor samples
thus important maximize probability detecting fusion genes least amount sequencing
probability depends multiple factors including number length end-sequenced clones length genes fused possible errors breakpoint localization
here derive several formulae elucidate trade-offs experimental design both current next-generation sequencing technologies
our probability calculations simulations demonstrate even current paired-end technology obtain extremely high probability breakpoint detection very low number reads
example more than 90 percent all breakpoints detected paired-end sequencing less than 100,000 clones
additionally next-generation sequencers potentially detect rearrangements greater than 99 percent probability localize breakpoints rearrangements intervals less than 300 bp single run machine
