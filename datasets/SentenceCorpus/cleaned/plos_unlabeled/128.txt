 introduction 
one interesting lessons learned analysis human genome may possess fewer than 25,000 genes
one mechanism dramatically increase complexity human proteome lower-than-expected number genes allow some genes encode multiple proteins
process accomplished alternative precursor messenger rna splicing
studies use expressed sequence tag alignments identify alternatively spliced genes led researchers predict up 60 percent human genes alternatively spliced
alternative splicing events regulated tissue-specific developmental hormone-responsive manners providing additional mechanisms regulation gene expression
understanding alternative splicing its regulation key component understanding metazoan genomes
current models alternative splicing regulation based interactions intronic exonic rna sequences known cis elements splicing regulatory proteins known trans-acting splicing factors
binding splicing factors pre-mrna regulates ability spliceosomal machinery recognize promote alternative splicing
role intronic elements regulating splicing well established been shown work combinatorial fashion based trans-acting factors present
example inclusion 18-nucleotide-long neural-specific n1 exon human c-src gene regulated downstream control sequence found intron downstream n1 exon
sequence serves recruitment site both constitutive neuronal cell-specific splicing factors nptb fox-1 fox-2
vertebrate rna-binding protein fox-1 also regulate muscle-specific alternative splicing through interactions rna sequence gcaug repeats sequence been shown important alternative splicing regulation fibronectin exon eiiib rat calcitonin/cgrp exon 4
many other examples complex combinatorial regulation alternative splicing through intronic cis elements been demonstrated combinatorial interactions between proteins nova-1 polypyrimidine tract binding protein etr-3 specific cis sequences important alternative splicing regulation 
intronic sequences non-coding therefore they should less evolutionary selective pressure maintain their sequence
exception should intronic sequences regulate alternative splicing

alignment two genomes revealed exonic sequences highly conserved between species but intronic intergenic sequences rarely conserved
found rare high homology sequences introns more likely occur introns flanking alternatively spliced exons than total introns
hypothesized conserved intronic regions were cis-acting regulatory elements alternative splicing
nematode alignment relatively limited regions high homology provides possibility more specific pinpointing intronic splicing regulatory elements than much longer 100-nucleotide-long conserved regions flanking alternative exons mouse/human alignments
