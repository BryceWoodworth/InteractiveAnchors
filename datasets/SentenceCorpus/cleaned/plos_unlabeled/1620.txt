 introduction 
gene duplicability defines propensity retain multiple copies gene varies among species gene categories
yeast singleton genes i.e single copy genes whose duplication selected against preferentially encode members protein complexes highly connected essential proteins
similar relationships maintained also multicellular species worm fly where singleton genes encode highly connected essential proteins
strict retention one single copy particular gene categories consequence fragility towards dosage modifications
their duplication deleterious because interferes essential cellular functions fine-tuned equilibrium between formation disruption protein-protein interactions 
recent studies showed duplicability mammalian hubs essential proteins different other species
human hubs mouse essential proteins involved development preferentially encoded duplicated genes while other categories essential mouse genes both singletons duplicated
differences between human mouse other species suggest gene duplicability underwent modifications during evolution likely related extensive acquisition novel genes vertebrates
through massive gene duplication followed diversification paralogs vertebrates accommodated expansion gene families involved regulation signal transduction protein transport protein modification
context been proposed higher connectivity may favor functional diversification paralogs example through tissue specialization
however thorough analysis types genes undergo modification their duplicability during evolution how influences network properties encoded proteins still missing
comparison gene network properties between species most straightforward approach verify whether modification gene duplicability indeed related expansion vertebrate gene repertoire
despite fact current representations protein interactomes still incomplete may include high fraction false positives recent completion interaction screenings several species finally allows comparative network analyses
example comparison human fly worm yeast networks showed they maintain similar structure despite difference size
addition regardless their connectivity proteins occupy central positions interactomes saccharomyces cerevisiae drosophila melanogaster caenorhabditis elegans also essential slow-evolving
studies demonstrate comparison protein gene properties different species used infer general evolutionary trends
unravel when differences between duplicability network properties arose during evolution undertake comparative analysis genes networks four species escherichia coli yeast fly human
species display different levels complexity defined number genes cells cell types also high quality genomic interaction data
compare connectivity centrality all proteins origin conservation duplicability corresponding genes
identify core singleton hubs whose properties maintained constant prokaryotes human another group duplicated hubs emerged during evolution vertebrates
our analysis provides evidence how hubs properties modified during evolution helps interpreting occurrence somatic genetic diseases typical multicellularity cancer terms network perturbations
particular find cancer genes representatives two groups human hubs: one originated early evolution composed singleton genes other appeared later enriched duplicated genes
functionally two groups correspond caretakers gatekeepers suggesting two different ways initiate tumorigenesis emerged at different times during evolution
