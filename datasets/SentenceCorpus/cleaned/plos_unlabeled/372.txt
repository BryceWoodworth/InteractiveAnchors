based common properties developed conceptual models mass conserved reaction diffusion system diffusion driven instability
conceptual models retained similar behaviors cell polarity rho gtpase model
using models numerically analytically found multiple polarized peaks unstable resulting single stable peak sensitivity toward changes signal gradient specifically restricted at polarized peak

 introduction 
eukaryotic cells neutrophils dictyostelium cells respond temporal spatial gradients extracellular signals directional movements
process known chemotaxis fundamental cellular process
migrating cell specific molecular events take place at front back edges
spatially distinctive molecular accumulation inside cells known cell polarity
front back polarity usually one axis uniqueness important property because migrating cell two fronts could not move effectively
another behavior front back polarity higher sensitivity front gradient extracellular signals
would also important because direction movement should controlled at front edge
many molecules involved chemotaxis mammalian cells been identified
some molecules including phosphoinositide 3-kinase phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate cdc42 rac f-actin specifically localized at front whereas others including phosphatase tensin homologue deleted chromosome 10 rhoa at back migrating cells
rho family small gtpases particular play central role chemotaxis establishing cell polarity
however mechanism generating spatial accumulation rho gtpases cell polarity yet clarified
many mathematical models account gradient sensing signal amplification cell polarity been proposed
local excitation global inhibition model been proposed explain spatial gradient sensing
some models involve positive feedback loops amplified accumulation signaling molecules
reaction diffusion model includes local self-enhancement long-range antagonistic effects been proposed directional sensitivity
most reported models cell polarity involve detailed parameters concentrations rate constants been constructed many parameters equations
although detailed models at least partially successful reproducing experimental observations cell polarity theoretical essence underlying cell polarity not been explicitly demonstrated; thus simple conceptual model used analytical study needed extract common principles cell polarity
although reported models consist distinct molecular species networks should especially emphasized many them able exhibit similar behaviors cell polarity regardless their different frameworks
fact indicates common principle should underlie models conceptual model suitable extracting common principles cell polarity
because rho small gtpases key regulators cell polarity first developed reaction diffusion model rho gtpases basis earlier model examine spatial properties rho gtpases
found interaction rho gtpases per se generate specific spatial accumulation rho gtpases our model shows important behaviors cell polarity
also found our model exhibits behaviors similar model narang subramanian based molecular networks different ours
suggests common principles should underlie both models
found mass conservation components diffusion-driven instability commonly conserved narang subramanian models our model
based common properties established conceptual models mass conserved reaction diffusion system found properties account critical behaviors cell polarity
results strongly suggest mass conservation components diffusion-driven instability one fundamental principles cell polarity
