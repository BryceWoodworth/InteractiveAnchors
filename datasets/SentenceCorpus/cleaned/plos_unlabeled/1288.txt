 
computational methods attempting identify instances cis-regulatory modules genome face challenging problem searching potentially interacting transcription factor binding sites while knowledge specific interactions involved remains limited
without comprehensive comparison their performance reliability accuracy tools remains unclear
faced large number different tools address problem summarized categorized them based search strategy input data requirements
twelve representative methods were chosen applied predict crms drosophila crm database redfly across human encode regions
our results show optimal choice method varies depending species composition sequences question
when discriminating crms non-coding regions those methods considering evolutionary conservation stronger predictive power than methods designed run single genome
different crm representations search strategies rely different crm properties different methods complement one another
example some favour homotypical clusters binding sites while others perform best short crms
furthermore most methods appear sensitive composition structure genome they applied
analyze principal features distinguish methods performed well identify weaknesses leading poor performance provide guide users
also propose key considerations development evaluation future crm-prediction methods
 introduction 
cis-acting transcriptional regulation involves sequence-specific binding transcription factors dna
most cases multiple transcription factors control transcription single transcription start site cooperatively
limited repertoire transcription factors performs complex regulatory step through various spatial temporal interactions between themselves their binding sites
genome-wide scale transcription factor binding interactions clustered distinct modules rather than distributed evenly
modules called cis-regulatory modules
dna sequences promoters enhancers silencers others examples modules
appropriate transcription factors compete bind elements act activators repressors
generally crm ranges few hundred basepairs long few thousand basepairs long; several transcription factors bind each transcription factors multiple binding sites 
berman et al demonstrated feasibility identifying crms sequence analysis
they scanned drosophila genome clusters potential binding sites five gap gene transcription factors known together regulate early drosophila embryo
they found more than third dense clusters binding sites correspond crms regulating early embryo gene expressions characteristic genes regulated maternal gap transcription factors
similarly exploiting property many crms contain clusters similar transcription factor binding sites schroeder et al computationally predicted crms over genomic regions genes interest gap mixed maternal-gap transcription factors identified both known novel crms within segmentation gene network
recent study confirmed importance crm functions revealed how subtle changes original arrangement module elements affect its function
gompel et al found modifications cis-regulatory elements pigmentation gene yellow cause wing pigmentation spot appear drosophila biarmipes similar seen drosophila melanogaster thus showing mutations crms generate novelty between species
later study they showed creation destruction distinct regulatory elements same gene lead same morphological change
williams et al investigated genetic switch whereby hox protein abd-b controls bab expression sexually dimorphic trait drosophila
they discovered functional difference case lies not only creation destruction binding sites but also their orientations spacings
there also evidence showing disruption cooperations within specific crm lead malformation disease
one example given kleinjan et al
deletion any distal regulatory elements pax6 changes its expression level causes congenital eye malformation aniridia brain defects human
