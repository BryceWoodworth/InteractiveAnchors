 
evolution shaping world around us
at core every evolutionary process population reproducing individuals
outcome evolutionary process depends population structure
here provide general formula calculating evolutionary dynamics wide class structured populations
class includes recently introduced games phenotype space evolutionary set theory
there local interactions determining relative fitness individuals but require global updating means all individuals compete uniformly reproduction
study competition two strategies context evolutionary game determine strategy favored limit weak selection
derive intuitive formula structure coefficient provide method efficient numerical calculation
 introduction 
constant selection implies fitness individuals does not depend composition population
general however success individuals affected what others doing
then realm game theory evolutionary game theory
latter study frequency dependent selection; fitness individuals typically assumed linear function frequencies strategies population
population trying adapt dynamic fitness landscape; changes fitness landscape caused population moves over
there also close relationship between evolutionary game theory ecology : success species ecosystem depends its own abundance abundance other species
classical approach evolutionary game dynamics based deterministic differential equations describing infinitely large well-mixed populations
well-mixed population any two individuals interact equally likely
some recent approaches consider stochastic evolutionary dynamics populations finite size
evolutionary game dynamics also affected population structure
example well-mixed population typically opposes evolution cooperation while structured population promote
there also long standing tradition studying spatial models ecology population genetics inclusive fitness theory 
evolutionary graph theory extension spatial games normally studied regular lattices general graphs
graph determines who meets whom reflects physical structure social networks
payoff individuals derived local interactions their neighbors graph
moreover individuals compete locally their neighbors reproduction
two processes also described separate graphs 
games phenotype space represent another type spatial model evolutionary dynamics motivated idea tag based cooperation
addition behavioral strategies individuals express other phenotypic features serve markers identification
one version model individuals interact only those who carry same phenotypic marker
approach lead clustering phenotype space promote evolution cooperation 
evolutionary set theory represents another type spatial model
each individual belong several sets
at particular time some sets many members while others empty
individuals interact others same set thereby derive payoff
individuals update their set memberships strategies global comparison others
successful strategies spawn imitators successful sets attract more members
therefore population structure described ever changing dynamical graph
evolutionary dynamics set structured populations favor cooperators over defectors
all three frameworks evolutionary graph theory games phenotype space evolutionary set theory fitness individuals consequence local interactions
evolutionary graph theory there also local update rule: individuals learn their neighbors graph compete nearby individuals placing offspring
evolutionary set theory however assumes global updating: individuals learn all others population adopt their strategies set memberships
global updating also feature model games phenotype space
approach presented paper requires global updating
therefore our result holds evolutionary set theory games phenotype space but does not apply evolutionary graph theory
