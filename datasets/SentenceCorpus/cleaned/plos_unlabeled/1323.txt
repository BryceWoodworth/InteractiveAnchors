our focus was elucidate underlying biologic processes
although initially found little overlap between changed metabolites preconceived definitions metabolic pathways use unbiased network approaches identified significant concerted changes
specifically derived metabolic network edges drawn between reactant product nodes individual reactions between all substrates individual enzymes transporters
searched active modules regions metabolic network enriched changes metabolite levels
active modules identified relationships among changed metabolites highlighted importance specific solute carriers metabolite profiles

 introduction 
disease heterogeneity challenged practice medicine
individuals same apparent disease at our current diagnostic resolution often show remarkable variation prognosis treatment responsiveness presumably because superficially similar disease state arise diverse combinations genetic environmental factors
efforts resolve heterogeneity focused collecting increasing amounts quantitative patient information including genotypic mrna protein expression data hope establishing better clinical classifiers based aberrant activities specific targetable biological pathways
using tumor biopsy samples oncologists now exploring incorporation genomewide expression profiling into therapy
however complex human diseases span multiple organ systems metabolomics analysis broad array metabolite levels biologic fluid samples blood urine represents minimally-invasive way obtain quantitative biologic information patients uncover disease pathophysiology aid diagnostic prognostic classification 
metabolomics data analysis may facilitated techniques applied other high-throughput omic data types
microarray data integration network information protein-protein interaction data predefined biologic pathways greatly assisted elucidation underlying processes led development increasingly robust accurate gene-based classifiers disease
hypothesize characterization human disease metabolomic profiling should similarly benefit interpreting metabolite changes context known metabolic reactions

next applied unbiased pathway analysis mapping metabolite changes recent reconstruction human metabolic network use recently developed variant previous approaches derived mrna expression analysis find active metabolic modules connected subnetworks highly changed metabolites
while biased approach yielded little resulting unbiased pathway models highlight interconnectedness between changed metabolites propose role solute carriers ogtt metabolite profiles
hierarchical clustering principal component analysis confirmed importance specific transporters demonstrating metabolites cluster naturally according activities system l amino acid slc6a12 osmolyte transporters
