 introduction 
proto-oncogene protein myc transcription factor regulates numerous signaling pathways involved cell-fate decisions
sufficient accumulation myc leads activation cyclin d cyclin dependent kinases subsequently phosphorylate rb release e2f
results initiation dna replication cell cycle entry
excessive accumulation myc however induces apoptosis when cells under stress deprived growth factors
finally myc also drives cell growth activating genes encode cellular metabolic activities including translational factors ribosomal proteins rnas 
given its importance myc activity must properly controlled response different environmental cues
past studies suggested myc regulated at multiple levels including auto-regulation myc transcription post-transcriptional regulation
more recent discoveries indicate myc also dynamically regulated at protein level ras effector pathways
discoveries suggest myc protein undergoes series modifications sequential irreversible
more specifically when myc newly synthesized highly unstable quickly undergoes ubiquitination degradation
substantially stabilized when phosphorylated at serine 62 ras-activated erk activity
subsequent phosphorylation myc at threonine 58 gsk3 however initiates destabilization process sequential manner
achieved dephosphorylation mechanism prolyl isomerase pin1 protein phosphatase pp2a
once myc phosphorylated at thr58 pin1 induces undergo conformation changes required pp2a dephosphorylate ser62 residue
date only dephosphorylation mechanism identified myc stabilization processes
destabilization myc gsk3 blocked ras-activated pi3k pathway 
unique control myc dynamics sequential phosphorylation allows myc integrate upstream signals erk pi3k play critical roles controlling diverse cell fates
erk often exhibits early transient peak activation upon growth stimulation
peak followed varying residual activities depend cell lines growth factors
residual erk critical downstream signal encoding
example pc12 cells small residual erk activity result epidermal growth factor stimulation leads proliferation
contrast high residual erk activity result nerve growth factor stimulation same cell line leads differentiation
residual erk level also been observed critical regulating c-fos level fibroblasts 
pi3k activation pattern depends cell lines stimulants detailed table s2
bimodal various cell lines including wi38 nih 3t3 hepg2 when stimulated platelet-derived growth factors fetal bovine serum
contrast pi3k appears only early transient single peak u-2os pvsm cell lines stimulated other growth stimulants
bimodal activation pi3k been shown important cell cycle regulation
particular second peak been found sufficient critical drive g1/s transition during cell cycle 
temporal pattern myc activation closely correlates those erk pi3k
myc protein reaches its peak at 2 hours after growth stimulation decreases remains at intermediate value hump over 6 hours before reducing its basal level
peak hump myc coincide erk peak 2 nd pi3k pulse respectively
observations suggest myc may sense integrate signals its two regulators 
gain insight into control mechanism constructed mathematical model analyze dynamics myc accumulation controlled sequential phosphorylation
