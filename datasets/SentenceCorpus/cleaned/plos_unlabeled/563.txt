 introduction 
problem combination therapy medical algorithmic aspects
medically still not able provide effective cures most chronic complex diseases main causes death disability nor able address progressive age-related decline human functional capacity
algorithmically when biological dysfunction involves complex biological networks therapeutic interventions multiple targets likely required
because effect drugs depends dose several doses need studied number possible combinations rises quickly
example many cancer chemotherapy regimens composed 6 more drugs pool more than 100 clinically used anticancer drugs exploring even larger combinations might justified
if were study all combinations 6 out 100 compounds at 3 different doses would 8.9 10 11 possibilities
example shows problem requires qualitatively new approach rather than simply more efficient screening technology
combined drug interventions common therapeutic strategy complex diseases hypertension cancer
pointed out recently cancer therapy most therapies were initially developed effective single agents only later combined clinically
possible approach exploration new therapeutic activities not present individual drugs based exhaustive study all possible combinations pairs compounds
brute force approach detected many interesting novel pairs compounds but resulting exponential expansion number possibilities precludes comprehensive exploration larger combinations
several authors recently argued future combination therapy lies development accurate quantitative network models capture mechanistic interactions cellular organism physiology
fitzgerald et al acknowledge do not yet know what models will look like systems biology research still data-limited purpose
indeed their recent review does not report any successful application approach combination therapies
here suggest novel solution problem combination drug therapy making use search algorithms originally developed digital communication
when modified several key aspects search strategies used find more effective combined therapeutic interventions without need fully factorial experimental design
algorithms may also provide framework upon information system-wide molecular data mechanistic computational networks models superimposed
understand motivation our work important consider even if simulations might play role intended use algorithms not entirely silico but partially vivo vitro using high-throughput biological measurements organisms isolated cells respectively
approach becomes increasingly relevant because high-throughput measurement technology initially developed drug companies screening large libraries compounds multi-well plate formats now more more available scientific community
useful regard information processing our experimental systems parallel biological computations since algorithms using indeed derived algorithms were implemented silico other scientific fields
parallel measurements suitable multi-well high-throughput technology
there requirements regarding computational complexity algorithms limit choice suitable approaches
requirements discussed more detail results
both number operations computational costs unique vivo/in vitro algorithms should considered
algorithm design requires application appropriate structure data
although there many options represent space possible drug combinations used tree representation drug combinations nodes linking all possible additions one drug next level
individual drugs form base tree combinations maximum size at top
when exploring drug combination tree going smaller larger combinations algorithms suggest giving more weight lower-order drug interactions
consistent data available adverse drug interactions reported mostly two-drug combinations
estimating optimal size combination different problem examined detail discussion
beneficial effect combination also due additive components multiple higher-order effects
search algorithms suggest derived sequential decoding algorithms
were chosen part because similarities among data trees searched biological decoding applications
sequential decoding algorithms used convolutional codes nearby nodes data tree related similarly different but partially overlapping combinations drugs
another feature sequential algorithms fit our purposes use list-based memory path taken reach each node
provide discussion detailed argument suggesting suitable algorithm should able integrate all available information state system obtained iterative measurements
integration should take place at every iteration within algorithm rather than being weighted average different methods applied separately
presence updated list guide each iteration provides our algorithms natural mean information integration
both fully factorial dataset show figure 1 complex structure biological networks being reconstructed systems biology supports expectation frequent non-linearities phenotype measurements along data tree
therefore interested algorithms search within solution space presenting substantial non-linearities
if relation among drugs combination were linear best algorithm would simply determine best dose single drug measurements use obtain best combination
if contrary non-linearities were extreme use stochastic algorithms might preferable
stochastic algorithms cope multiple local minima solution space but they do so incorporating random element
requires price terms computational cost performance stochastic algorithms therefore often not good more tailored algorithms
algorithms suggest cope moderate variable non-linearities going back previous nodes tree
starting stack sequential algorithm was developed search optimal decoding field digital communications describe test algorithms used search optimal combination sizeable number drugs testing only small subset all possible combinations
algorithms useful large combinations where collecting fully factorial datasets not feasible
present results obtained simulations computational model cell death experiments using two models complementary biological properties: restoring decline age heart function exercise capacity drosophila melanogaster;and selective killing human cancer cells
first vivo experimental model advantage including complexity whole organism interventions while second vitro model potential markedly higher throughput testing
models also representative two different general types multi-drug interventions: one type aims at improving function while other based induction cell death selective disruption network function
results suggest optimal near-optimal combinations compounds found systems only small fraction number tests fully factorial design significantly higher efficacy than random searching
summary contributions work are:
constructing novel problem statement search drug combinations using novel approach systems biology 
collecting exhaustive experimental measurements sufficient solve problem conclusively
constructing computational method solve problem approximately fewer experimental measurements
suggested algorithms modeled algorithms already used other fields while our main original contribution their novel application
providing additional experiments support generality approach
