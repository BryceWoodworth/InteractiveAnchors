 
our investigation knotted structures protein data bank reveals most complicated knot discovered date
suggest occurrence knot human ubiquitin hydrolase might related role enzyme protein degradation
while knots usually preserved among homologues also identify exception transcarbamylase
allows us exemplify function knots proteins suggest how they may been created
 introduction 
although knots abundant complex globular homopolymers they rare simple proteins
sixteen methyltransferases bacteria viruses combined into / knot superfamily several isozymes carbonic anhydrase known knotted
apart two folds only few insular knots been reported some were derived incomplete structures
most part knotted proteins contain simple trefoil knots represented three essential crossings projection onto plane
only three proteins were identified four projected crossings 
report provide first comprehensive review knots proteins considers all entries protein data bank not just subset
allows us examine knots homologous proteins
our analysis reveals several new knots all enzymes
particular discovered most complicated knot found date human ubiquitin hydrolase suggest its entangled topology protects against being pulled into proteasome
also noticed knots usually preserved among structural homologues
sequence similarity appears strong indicator preservation topology although differences between knotted unknotted structures sometimes subtle
interestingly also identified novel knot transcarbamylase not present homologues known structure
show presence knot alters functionality protein suggest how knot may been created first place
mathematically knots rigorously defined closed loops
fortunately both n c-termini open proteins typically accessible surface connected unambiguously: reduce protein its c  backbone draw two lines outward starting at termini direction connection line between center mass backbone respective ends
lines joined big loop structure topologically classified determination its alexander polynomial
applying method protein data bank version january 3 2006 found 273 knotted structures 32,853 entries contain proteins
knots formed disulfide hydrogen bonds were not included study
