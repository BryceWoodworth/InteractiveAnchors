accuracy process limited stochastic fluctuations concentration external signal internal signaling components
here use information theory determine optimal scheme detect location external chemoattractant source presence noise
compute minimum amount mutual information needed between chemoattractant gradient internal signal achieve prespecified chemotactic accuracy
show more accurate chemotaxis requires greater mutual information
also demonstrate priori information improve chemotaxis efficiency
compare optimal signaling schemes existing experimental measurements models eukaryotic gradient sensing
remarkably there good quantitative agreement between optimal response when no priori assumption made about location existing source observed experimental response unpolarized dictyostelium discoideum cells
contrast measured response polarized d discoideum cells matches closely optimal scheme assuming prior knowledge external gradient example through prolonged chemotaxis given direction
our results demonstrate different observed classes responses cells optimal under varying information assumptions
 introduction 
recently there been considerable research demonstrating critical role played random fluctuations cellular signaling systems
stochastic variations found external signaling molecules well intracellular components
they arise because small number molecules involved signaling play significant roles gene regulatory networks well prokaryotic eukaryotic signal transduction pathways 
proper functioning cellular signaling networks requires mechanisms tolerate effects noise
however questions remain how evaluate performance efficiency cellular decision-making systems
how well does signaling network cell make decisions based signaling cues available
improvements made altering parameters structure network
how efficiently resources used
here argue rate distortion theory branch information theory used evaluate effectiveness systems
application information theory study biology been under way some time received considerable attention fields neuroscience genetics
however full breadth utility biological signaling systems general not been realized primarily because difficulty defining information general biological systems
here use rate distortion theory tool study performance cost tradeoffs general spatial gradient sensing mechanisms similar those found many eukaryotic cells including neutrophils amoebae
rate distortion theory provides bounds rate at information must transmitted through system achieve given performance criterion
our results demonstrate depending prior knowledge cell about its chemoattractant environment different optimal chemotaxis strategies exist
furthermore show differences observed behaviors unpolarized polarized chemotactic cells correspond various optimally efficient decision-making processes
