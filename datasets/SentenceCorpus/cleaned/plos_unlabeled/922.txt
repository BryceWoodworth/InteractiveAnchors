mechanistic understanding protein motions intrigued structural biologists bio-informaticians physicists explore molecular motions last five decades
two seminal breakthroughs 1960 structures haemoglobin myoglobin were solved consequently first time mechanistic structural insights into motion protein were deduced its snap-shot image
finding paved way by-now classical model cooperativity binding allosteric proteins
nowadays hundreds proteins known multiple conformations together their suggested molecular motion recorded databases molmovdb
number increases influx solved structures protein data bank
inherent flexibility characteristic fundamental protein functions catalysis signal transduction allosteric regulation
elucidating motion protein structures essential understanding their function particular understanding control mechanisms prevent allow protein motions
understanding relation between protein sequence protein motion allow de-novo design dynamic proteins enhance our knowledge about transition states provide putative conformations targeting drugs
accurate prediction protein motion also help address other computational challenges
instance normal mode analysis motion predictions used efficient introduction localized flexibility into docking procedures 
experimental knowledge macro-molecular motions been discouragingly limited day fact high-resolution structures solved x-ray crystallography merely outmost stable conformations proteins sense snap shot dynamic entity
