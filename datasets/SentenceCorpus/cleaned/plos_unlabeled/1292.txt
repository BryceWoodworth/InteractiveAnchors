 
computational efforts identify functional elements within genomes leverage comparative sequence information looking regions exhibit evidence selective constraint
one way detecting constrained elements follow bottom-up approach computing constraint scores individual positions multiple alignment then defining constrained elements segments contiguous highly scoring nucleotide positions
here present gerp new tool uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation position-specific scoring contrast previous bottom-up methods novel dynamic programming approach subsequently define constrained elements
gerp evaluates richer set candidate element breakpoints ranks them based statistical significance eliminating need biased heuristic extension techniques
using gerp identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7 percent human genome
predict higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due annotation longer constrained elements improves one one correspondence between predicted elements known functional sequences
gerp efficient effective tool provide both nucleotide element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments
 introduction 
identification annotation all functional elements human genome one main goals contemporary genetics general encode project particular
comparative sequence analysis enabled multiple sequence alignments human genome dozens mammalian species become powerful tool pursuit goal sequence conservation due negative selection often strong signal biological function
after constructing multiple sequence alignment one quantify evolutionary rates at level individual positions identify segments alignment show significantly elevated levels conservation
several computational methods constrained element detection been developed most falling into one two broad categories: generative model-based approaches attempt explicitly model quantity distribution constraint within alignment bottom-up approaches first estimate constraint at individual positions then look clusters highly constrained positions
widely used generative approach phastcons uses phylo-hidden markov model find most likely parse alignment into constrained neutral hidden states
while hmms widely used modeling biological sequences they known drawbacks: transition probabilities imply specific geometric state duration distribution context phastcons means predicted constrained neutral segment length
may bias resulting estimates element length total genomic fraction under constraint
one leading bottom-up approaches gerp quantifies position-specific constraint terms rejected substitutions difference between neutral rate substitution observed rate estimated maximum likelihood heuristically extends contiguous segments constrained positions blast-like manner
however gerp computationally slow because its maximum likelihood computation uses expectation maximization algorithm estimate new set branch lengths each position alignment; step also undesirable methodologically because involves estimating k real-valued parameters k nucleotides data
furthermore extension heuristic used gerp may induce biases length predicted ces
work present gerp novel bottom-up method constrained element detection like gerp uses rejected substitutions metric constraint
gerp uses significantly faster more statistically robust maximum likelihood estimation procedure compute expected rates evolution results more than 100-fold reduction computation time
addition introduce novel criterion grouping constrained positions into constrained elements using statistical significance guide assigning p-values our predictions
apply dynamic programming approach globally predict set constrained elements ranked their p-values concomitant false positive rate estimate
using gerp analyzed alignment human genome 33 other mammalian species identifying over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7 percent human genome high confidence
compared previous methods predict larger fraction human genome contained constrained elements due annotation many fewer but longer elements very low false positive rate
