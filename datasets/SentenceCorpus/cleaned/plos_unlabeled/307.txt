instead being fluid homogeneous recent studies suggest membranes characterized transient domains varying fluidity
particular number experimental studies revealed existence highly ordered lateral domains rich sphingomyelin cholesterol
domains called functional lipid rafts been suggested take part variety dynamic cellular processes membrane trafficking signal transduction regulation activity membrane proteins
however despite proposed importance domains their properties even precise nature lipid phases remained open issues mainly because associated short time length scales posed major challenge experiments

studies provide evidence presence psm chol raft-like membranes leads strongly packed rigid bilayers
also find simulated raft bilayers characterized nanoscale lateral heterogeneity though slow lateral diffusion renders interpretation observed lateral heterogeneity more difficult
findings reveal aspects role favored lipid lipid interactions within rafts clarify prominent role chol altering properties membrane locally its neighborhood
also show presence psm chol rafts leads intriguing lateral pressure profiles distinctly different corresponding profiles nonraft-like membranes

 introduction 
understanding lipid membrane structures their role cellular functions developed significantly since introduction classical fluid-mosaic model singer nicolson
fluid-mosaic model predicted cellular membranes fluid characterized random distribution molecular components membrane resulting lateral rotational freedom
more recent picture considerably more elaborate however
large number experimental results converge toward idea lateral domains enriched sphingomyelin cholesterol exist biological membranes
nanosized domains called functional lipid rafts been suggested take part various dynamic cellular processes membrane trafficking signal transduction regulation activity membrane proteins
existence stable lipid rafts biological membranes under intense scrutiny their existence actually under debate since lipid rafts if they do exist probably too small resolved techniques fluorescence microscopy
direct evidence rafts vivo mainly based monitoring motions membrane proteins differential partitioning fluorescent probes membrane environments
however difficult perform experiments using living cells complicates measurements physical quantities rafts exact lipid composition characteristic size lifetime
model membranes coexistence domains liquid ordered liquid disordered phase widely accepted
example l d phase may formed unsaturated phosphatidylcholine while formation l o phase promoted mixture sm chol
rafts current understanding lipid rafts biological membranes suggests granular structure nanometer-scale domains various compositions rather than large-scale phase separation
exact nature underlying interactions lead lipid immiscibilities membranes under debate
chol particularly important been shown increase conformational order acyl chains reduce bilayer area hence significantly increasing packing density lipids
chol particularly effective reducing void space within acyl chain region lipids related suppressed area compressibility increased bending rigidity membrane increasing chol concentrations
however lateral diffusion rates not expected slow down more than factor 2 3 when l d phase compared chol-induced l o phase
also chol recently been reported significantly alter lateral pressure profile membranes
important changes lateral pressure profiles been suggested related changes membrane protein structure activity 
considering smallest estimates sizes rafts fall range nanometers they make accessible subject computational studies
though spite considerable importance rafts somewhat surprising only few atom-scale simulations dealt ternary mixtures chol sm pc concentrating mainly small-scale structural properties local interactions between lipids
particular there no previous atom-level computational studies rafts aiming characterize nature their structural dynamical features
example nanometer scale structure within raft domains its interplay chol-induced effects not understood
further resulting large-scale properties membrane elasticity ternary raft-like lipid mixtures not understood either
finally perhaps most importantly lateral pressure profiles associated rafts completely unknown
concept lateral pressure profile across lipid membrane exceptionally significant since describes pressure exerted molecules embedded membrane
cantor proposed incorporation molecules into membrane changes lipid content would alter lateral pressure profile across membrane hence changes pressure profile would induce changes membrane protein structure
experimental studies issue remarkably difficult however: currently there only one study employed fluorescent probes gauge overall shape lateral pressure profile
evidently detailed atomistic simulations called
state-of-the-art extent simulations conducted work 15 20 nm lateral dimensions 100 ns time enables reliable quantitative analysis properties raft-like membranes not accomplished before
employ large-scale atom level simulations three mixtures palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine psm chol
molar fractions popc:psm:chol 1:1:1 2:1:1 62:1:1 systems call s s b s c respectively
based recent experimental phase diagram mixtures expected display coexistent l o l d phase domains single l d phase
here illustrate distinct nature raft-like domains three parts
first consider elastic thermodynamic dynamic properties rafts turn out very different those nonraft-like membranes
second provide evidence presence psm chol raft-like membranes leads strongly packed rigid bilayers characterized significant nanoscale lateral heterogeneity within raft domains
findings express prominent role favored lipid lipid interactions within rafts highlight significant role chol promoting formation rafts
third provide compelling evidence lateral pressure profiles altered change lipid content
particular show how presence psm chol leads intriguing lateral pressure profiles distinctly different corresponding lateral pressure profiles nonraft-like membranes proposing lipid membranes may regulate functioning certain classes membrane proteins mechanosensitive channels through changes lipid composition hence lateral pressure profile
