 
arabidopsis tandemly arrayed genes comprise 10 percent genes genome
duplicated genes represent rich template genetic innovation but little known evolutionary forces governing their generation maintenance
here compare organization evolution tags between arabidopsis rice two plant genomes diverged 150 million years ago
tags two genomes similar number respects including proportion genes tandemly arrayed number genes within array number tandem arrays dearth tags relative single copy genes centromeric regions
analysis recombination rates along rice chromosomes confirms positive correlation between occurrence tags recombination rate found arabidopsis
tags also biased functionally relative duplicated nontandemly arrayed genes
both genomes tags enriched genes encode membrane proteins function abiotic biotic stress but underrepresented genes involved transcription dna rna binding functions
speculate observations reflect evolutionary trend successful tandem duplication involves genes either at end biochemical pathways flexible steps pathway fluctuation copy number unlikely affect downstream genes
despite differences age distribution tandem arrays striking similarities between rice arabidopsis indicate similar mechanisms tag generation maintenance
 introduction 
genomes arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa contain substantial proportions duplicated chromosomal segments presumably reflecting ancient polyploidy events
arabidopsis example there been at least three paleopolyploid events most recent occurring 25 million years ago
duplicated chromosomal regions retain 25 percent their genes duplicates remaining duplicate pairs having lost one copy deletion pseudogenization
surprisingly process gene loss nonrandom respect function because genes retained duplicates enriched functions related transcription signal transduction development
like arabidopsis rice also history extensive duplication up 60 percent genome apparently duplicated paleopolyploid events up 50 percent genes retained duplicates duplicated chromosomal segments 
although there been numerous studies identify genes duplicated via paleopolyploidy one important source duplication plant genomes not been studied great detail: tandemly arrayed genes
tags gene family members tightly clustered chromosome they frequent plant genomes
thaliana tags comprise almost many genes those duplicated paleopolyploid events
they also represent broad functional component genome ranging genes encode secondary metabolites disease resistance genes regulatory genes 
evolution organization tags been studied arabidopsis
tags underrepresented centromeric regions relative non-tag genes their prevalence relative non-tag genes positively correlated recombination rates along chromosomes
evolutionary processes contributing correlation unclear
correlation could reflect generation tags via recombination-mediated processes unequal crossing-over could produced indirectly interplay among selection recombination gene gain gene loss
also unclear whether tag organization arabidopsis representative other plant genomes
tags also likely differ dispersed gene families their process divergence
close physical proximity tags facilitates gene conversion recently demonstrated both yeast arabidopsis
one practical ramification synonymous distance between tags cannot easily used proxy time duplication event gave rise two genes
instead ks provides insight into either age duplication event age homogenizing gene conversion events
nonetheless careful study ks values among clustered genes could uncover clues tag maintenance diversification
completion rice genome sequence provides first opportunity compare structure evolution tags between two plant genomes arabidopsis rice
two species diverged 150 million years ago but similar they relatively small genomes reproduce predominantly selfing
genomic analyses rice sequence already revealed some properties tags i.e tags compose between 16 percent 29 percent rice genes preponderance tandemly duplicated genes differentiated relatively low ks values
nonetheless tags rice not been studied comparative context nor context genomic features chromosomal location recombination
paper address several basic questions about organization evolution function tags
first does number distribution tags differ substantially between rice arabidopsis
second tags more frequent high recombination regions rice they arabidopsis
third do two species exhibit clear similarities differences distribution ks among tags
fourth do genes tags represent functional biases relative non-tag genes
finally infer any general mechanisms contribute similarities differences between distribution tags arabidopsis rice genomes
