 introduction 
g protein coupled receptors probably represent largest gene family making up 3 percent mammalian genome
proteins made up several subfamilies including class rhodopsin-like class b secretin-like class c metabotropic glutamate/pheromone-like other nonmammalian receptors
within each class there very large number smaller subclassifications family receptors peptide hormones within rhodopsin-like receptors
there approximately 1,000 gpcrs vast majority olfactory receptors more than 650 gpcrs rhodopsin family alone
large number receptors been identified only computational methods while others been cloned transfected into cells; however cognate neurotransmitter receptor functions many gpcrs currently unknown
any receptor native neurotransmitter unknown considered orphan receptor
all orphan receptors remain some percentage represents receptors peptide hormones
large family proteins important not only basic science perspective but because their extracellular sites action importance first messengers cellular signaling gpcrs become primary target drug development
fact over 30 percent all pharmaceuticals act either agonists antagonists gpcrs
many pharmaceutical companies identifying cloning patenting new orphan gpcrs hope orphan receptors will ultimately lead new drug development new pharmaceutical agents
although identification putative gpcrs accomplished relatively easily discovery endogenous ligands activate receptors far more difficult
ligands exist small molecules lipids peptides proteins
many atp may important functions other than activating gpcr
even within class hormones there seldom obvious clues identify new candidate
particularly true within family peptide hormones they processed larger species known preprohormones 
peptide hormones neuropeptides string amino acids ranging approximately 3 50 residues
they found within larger protein production actual hormone usually follows specific rules
preprohormones secreted proteins each signal sequence necessary transport protein out golgi complex into secretory vesicle processing secretion where signal sequence removed revealing prohormone
general hormones surrounded pair basic residues i.e arg-arg arg-lys lys-arg lys-lys found directly adjacent putative hormone
double basic residues act recognition sites processing enzymes usually serine proteases cleave prohormone liberate active peptide
many cases there more than single active peptide within one precursor protein 
even common features identification peptide hormone dna protein sequence very difficult
even though all gpcrs obviously related based upon dna protein sequence neuropeptides bind receptors only obviously related within discrete families prohormones
instance family opioid-like peptides four members
prohormones proopiomelanocortin proenkephalin prodynorphin pronociceptin share similar genomic structures very slight similarity protein sequence most notably yggf enkephalin endorphin dynorphin n/ofq
however if one were conduct blast search genbank dna sequences similar proenkephalin one would not find any other neuropeptide
simple search strategies within genbank not adequate identifying novel neuropeptides especially those not belonging known neuropepeptide families
there additional feature neuropeptides may more clearly differentiate them other types molecules
neuropeptides usually well conserved among various species while intervening sequences presumably because they simply discarded not well conserved
here describe novel hidden markov model based computational framework match profile hmm method neuropeptide identification based upon approach models spatial structure along genomic sequence simultaneously temporal evolutionary path structure across species show how models used discover new functional molecules via cross-genomic sequence comparisons
computational tool was used identify novel prohormone npq containing up four potential neuropeptides
