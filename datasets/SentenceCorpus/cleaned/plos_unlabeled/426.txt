 
correlated changes nucleic amino acids provided strong information about structures interactions molecules
despite rich literature coevolutionary sequence analysis previous methods often trade off between generality simplicity phylogenetic information specific knowledge about interactions
furthermore despite evidence coevolution selected protein families comprehensive screening coevolution among all protein domains still lacking
propose augmented continuous-time markov process model sequence coevolution
model handle different types interactions incorporate phylogenetic information sequence substitution only one extra free parameter requires no knowledge about interaction rules
employ model large-scale screenings entire protein domain database
strikingly 0.1 trillion tests executed majority inferred coevolving protein domains functionally related coevolving amino acid residues spatially coupled
moreover many coevolving positions located at functionally important sites proteins/protein complexes subunit linkers superoxide dismutase trna binding sites ribosomes dna binding region rna polymerase active ligand binding sites various enzymes
results suggest sequence coevolution manifests structural functional constraints proteins
intricate relations between sequence coevolution various selective constraints worth pursuing at deeper level
 introduction 
coevolution prevalent at species organismic molecular levels
at molecular level selective constraints operate entire system often require coordinated changes its components
most well-known example compensatory substitution nucleic acid pairs rna secondary structures
interacting nucleotides vary between au cg gu pairs different species order maintain hydrogen bonds
coordinated changes amino acid residues also been investigated
typically studies acquired one family aligned sequences examined covariation between aligned positions entire sequences
some applied different covariation metrics including correlation coefficients mutual information deviance between marginal conditional distributions
studies demonstrate sequence covariation powerful detecting protein protein interactions ligand-receptor bindings folding structure single proteins
addition direct physical interactions distant coevolving amino acid residues reported energetically coupled subject functional constraints proteins 
major drawback many covariation metrics lack phylogenetic information
sequences manifesting same level covariation may arise either few independent substitutions early ancestors correlated changes along multiple lineages
rna structure prediction many authors thereby extended continuous-time markov process sequence substitution coevolving nucleic acid pairs
however direct application models protein coevolution intractable due large number parameters ctmp amino acid pairs
problem was addressed replacing amino acids ctmp simplified surrogate alphabet sets presence/absence protein each species charge size amino acid groups
yet simplification deviates standard ctmp sequence substitution rich set empirical models available
all previous studies detecting protein coevolution target few proteins protein domains myoglobin pgk ntr family pdz domain family gag hsp90 groel proteins
availability large-scale protein sequences their phylogenetic information allows us perform systematic screening all known protein families
large-scale screening will give comprehensive information coevolution among all protein domains provide insight about their physical/functional couplings
propose general coevolutionary ctmp model requires neither simplification states nor prior knowledge about interactions only one extra free parameter
sequence substitution two sites modeled continuous-time markov process
null model hypothesizes two sites evolve independently
alternative model obtained null model reweighting independent substitution rate matrix favor double over single changes
apply model all inter intra-domain position pairs all known protein domain families pfam database
strikingly large number pairwise comparisons coevolving domain pairs highly enriched domains same proteins protein complexes possessing same functions
moreover coevolving positions demonstrate tendency spatial coupling mapped functionally important sites their proteins
