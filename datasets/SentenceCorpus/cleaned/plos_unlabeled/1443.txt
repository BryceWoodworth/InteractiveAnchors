 introduction 
one hurdle computational modeling cellular systems lack adequate tools
if one assumes molecules inside cells well-mixed they behave deterministically then one model chemical reactions cells use operate differential equations
however assumptions frequently inadequate
firstly most cellular processes depend at least some extent intracellular spatial organization
example cell signaling systems transmit signals across significant distances within subcellular compartments across intracellular membranes nuclear envelope
also cell division systems segregate one cell into two regulate partition molecular components
secondly many cellular outputs exhibit substantial random variation must arise random differences molecular collisions
examples range random switching swimming escherichia coli bacteria between so-called running tumbling states cell-to-cell variation operation cell signaling systems
more generally stochastic behavior likely affect outcomes essentially all cellular processes
representation complexity requires algorithms programs model cellular processes spatial accuracy model chemical reactions they operate stochastic detail 
computational biologists pursued four main approaches simulating biochemical systems spatial stochastic detail
differ how they represent space time molecules turn affects classes biological systems they simulate appropriately
spatial gillespie method based gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithms
divides simulation volume into coarse lattice subvolumes each contains many molecules interest
method computationally efficient because tracks total number individual classes molecules per subvolume rather than individual molecules
however lattice structure uses divide space into subvolumes does not work well realistic membrane shapes require special treatment
microscopic lattice method subdivides space into much finer lattice so each volume contain zero one molecule
method molecules diffuse hopping between sites react molecules neighboring sites
naturally lends itself studies oligomerization complex formation effects macromolecular crowding reactions
not found wide use studying cell-sized processes due facts high computational demands specific lattice structures affect simulated reaction rates differently although recent techniques may circumvent challenges
particle-based methods primary focus article most widely used spatial stochastic methods
represent individual molecules point-like particles diffuse continuous space over fixed time steps; molecules react when they collide
fact models use continuous space makes realistic membrane geometries relatively easy represent avoids lattice-based artifacts offers high spatial resolution
need track individual molecules however imposes high computational demands so particle-based methods about factor two slower than spatial gillespie methods
finally green's function reaction dynamics methods enable especially accurate particle-based simulation
gfrd methods step simulation exact time one individual reaction exact time next
makes methods ideal systems long delays between individual reactions but very computationally intensive most cellular processes 
dominant particle based simulators chemcell mcell smoldyn
programs many common features but differ other features quantitative accuracy their simulations
three chemcell fewest features but particularly easy use only simulator supports both spatial non-spatial simulations
mcell oldest program been used most produces highest quality graphics number features make particularly well suited simulating cellular processes involved synaptic transmission
smoldyn relative newcomer but yields most accurate results runs fastest
smoldyn also number attributes listed table 2 below make well suited modeling wide range cellular processes
article focuses latest version smoldyn smoldyn 2.1
smoldyn 1.0 embodied several algorithms were based smoluchowski reaction dynamics
subsequent versions were used investigate spatial version classic lotka-volterra chemical oscillator diffusion hair cell membranes protein sequestration dendritic spines diffusion obstructed spaces intracellular signaling e coli chemotaxis
smoldyn 2.1 preserves original focuses accuracy efficiency but offers significantly improved functionality
particular represent realistic membrane geometries simulate diffusion membrane-bound molecules accurately simulate wide variety molecule-membrane interactions
make general simulator possible smoldyn 2.1 also supports spatial compartments rule-based reaction network generation molecules excluded volume conformational spread interactions over fifty run-time commands system manipulation observation
anticipate smoldyn will particularly useful investigating cellular systems signaling division metabolic systems studying basic biophysical phenomena effects macromolecular crowding molecular diffusion helping quantify microscopy data diffusion rates investigated frap
