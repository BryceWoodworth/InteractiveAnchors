 introduction 
advent expression profiling other high throughput technologies enabled us systematically study complex human diseases simultaneously measuring tens thousands molecular species any given cell-based system
now routine organize large-scale gene expression data into co-expression networks shed light functional relationships among genes between genes disease traits
analysis co-expression networks used study any tissue organ long samples organs collected population setting
given mouse rat populations commonly used study human diseases manner important understand mechanisms conserved between human rodent species especially seek better predictions efficacy drug targets identified mouse rat human populations
addition identifying mechanisms differ between humans rodents help improve design interpretation toxicity studies involve rodent models
meta-analysis statistical synthesis data aggregating results set comparable studies
used systematically examine similarities differences between molecular profiling studies carried out populations different species
gene co-expression network relationship between gene pairs usually measured correlation coefficients different forms pearson correlation spearman correlation mutual information
therefore problem combining comparing co-expression relationships across multiple datasets framed context meta-analysis correlation coefficients various methods already been introduced
one method fisher's inverse formula test computes combined statistic p-values correlation coefficients obtained individual datasets formula
under fairly general conditions statistic follows formula distribution formula degrees freedom under joint null hypothesis no correlation making possible compute p-values combined statistic
another widely used meta-analysis method involves computing weighted average common metric derived correlation coefficients individual datasets
statistic then used test homogeneity over individual measures statistical significance
datasets type meta-analysis typically weighted accuracy effect size they provide function individual sample sizes
once mean effect size calculated its statistical significance assessed estimating pooled variance mean effect size
defining effect size hedges olkin rosenthal rubin both advocated converting correlation coefficient into standard normal metric using fisher's z-transformation then calculating weighted average transformed scores
depending whether effect sizes assumed equal not multiple datasets fixed effect well random effect models employed
fixed effect models effect size population fixed but unknown constant therefore assumed same all datasets included meta-analysis
random effect models effect sizes may vary dataset dataset assumed random sample all population effect sizes
hunter schmidt introduced single random-effects method based untransformed correlation coefficients
one important feature type method heterogeneity effect sizes estimated provides way assess difference correlation coefficients across multiple datasets
schulze provided thorough review meta-analysis methods their applications
meta-analysis co-expression networks diverse datasets those constructed different species one central issue often unreasonable assume every gene pair unique true effect size across evolutionarily diverse species
although random effect models provide more realistic way accommodate cross species variation still assumes parametric distribution population effect sizes
circumvent problem non-parametric meta-analysis method was introduced identification conserved co-expression modules human fly worm yeast
method pearson correlation coefficients expression profiles between every gene pair were computed each organism then rank-transformed according their correlations all other genes
probabilistic test based order statistics was then applied evaluate probability observing particular configuration ranks across different organisms chance
advantage method two-fold: because method based non-parametric statistics makes no assumption underlying distribution correlation coefficients across multiple datasets; effect size defined gene-centric fashion any given gene correlations all other genes considered
however method also several limitations including loss power general given non-parametric formulization meta-analysis results cannot represented same format individual datasets given there no concept mean effect size
details individual methods presented methods section
their pros cons summarized supplementary table s1
paper develop method meta-analysis diverse datasets generated across multiple species
our method semi-parametric nature requiring fewer assumptions distribution effect size than purely parametric approach while retaining better statistical power than fully non-parametric method
also defines effect size gene centric allows computation mean effect size leads heterogeneity statistic test differences correlation structures among distinct datasets
unlike most network alignment algorithms connectivity-based approaches our method does not rely networks inferred a-priori individual datasets but instead focuses development rigorous statistics test directly relationship between every gene pair
simulation results showed our method robust against noises
when applied human mouse rat cross species meta-analysis liver co-expression networks demonstrate our method out-performs existing methods identifying functionally coherent gene pairs conserved among three species
our method also leads identification modules co-expressed genes represent core functions liver been conserved throughout evolution
both highly replicated less confident genome-wide association study candidate genes blood lipid levels found enriched conserved modules providing systematic way elucidate mechanisms affecting blood lipid levels
application our test homogeneity leads identification single sub-network driven apoe distinguishes two nearly identical experimental cross populations whose genetic backgrounds only vary respect gene apoe
further demonstrate genes involved human rodent specific liver interactions tend under positive selection throughout evolution
finally identified human-specific sub-network regulated rxrg been validated play different role hyperlipidemia type 2 diabetes between human mouse
taken together our approach represents novel step forward integrating gene co-expression networks multiple large scale datasets leverage not only conserved information but also differences dataset-specific
