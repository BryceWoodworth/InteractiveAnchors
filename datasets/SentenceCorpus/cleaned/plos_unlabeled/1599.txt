recent experiments reported characteristics nucleation growth clathrin coat: initiation was observed occur randomly but only within subdomains devoid cytoskeletal elements
bsc1 cell lines domains appear 400 nm diameter surrounded rim 200 nm dead zone
notably nucleation clathrin coats was observed only 400 nm region following salient properties: growth phase addition clathrin proceeds at steady rate about one triskelion every 2 s
two fates possible growing coat; they either transform into vesicle they abort containing about 10 40 triskelia suggests coat sizes bounded
while do not consider process nucleation growth clathrin based above observations study process one maturing vesicle presence assembled clathrin coat finite size membrane patch free cytoskeletal elements subject pinned boundary condition at patch boundary
our model cell membrane patch not fortified cytoskeleton employ typical value bending rigidity our 20k bt derived literature ;
respect describe mean-field model characterizes membrane patch homogeneous phase effective properties
our model also mean-field sense applies just one vesicular intermediate effect neighboring coats not included
noted earlier our model does not account mechanism clathrin coat nucleation vesicle scission
clathrin triskelia ap-2 polymerize form coat stabilizing interactions clathrin coat assembly quantified using free energy polymerization process
based vitro equilibrium data clathrin cage formation nossal estimated energetics fully-closed clathrin/ap-2 basket relative dissolved coat 20 k bt
inclusion epsin clathrin-coat accounts 23 k bt energy per bound epsin: enth domain epsin binds ptdinsp 2 lipid head groups membrane binding energy 14 k bt per bound epsin clap domain epsin interacts clathrin/ap-2 energy 9 k bt
enth interactions membrane require presence pip2 constitutes about 1 percent total phospholipids cell membrane
produce coated vesicle d 50 nm diameter area clathrin coat required d 2 7850 nm 2
considering area per lipid head-group 0.65 nm 2 number pip2 molecules membrane spanning area coat 1 percent 185
hence note ratio enth binding sites clap binding sites 185/29 6 hence clathrin coat grows expect sufficient number corresponding pip2 binding sites present enth domain epsin bind
reason justified not explicitly considering pip2 necessary/limiting species our minimal model
