 
merging network theory microarray data analysis techniques spawned new field: gene coexpression network analysis
while network methods increasingly used biology network vocabulary computational biologists tends far more limited than say social network theorists
here review propose several potentially useful network concepts
take advantage relationship between network theory field microarray data analysis clarify meaning relationship among network concepts gene coexpression networks
network theory offers wealth intuitive concepts describing pairwise relationships among genes depicted cluster trees heat maps
conversely microarray data analysis techniques also used address difficult problems network theory
describe conditions when close relationship exists between network analysis microarray data analysis techniques provide rough dictionary translating between two fields
using angular interpretation correlations provide geometric interpretation network theoretic concepts derive unexpected relationships among them
use singular value decomposition module expression data characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks i.e adjacency matrices factor into node specific contributions
high low level views coexpression networks allow us study relationships among modules among module genes respectively
characterize coexpression networks where hub genes significant respect microarray sample trait show network concept intramodular connectivity interpreted fuzzy measure module membership
illustrate our results using human mouse yeast microarray gene expression data
unification coexpression network methods traditional data mining methods inform application development systems biologic methods
 introduction 
many biological networks share topological properties
common global properties include modular organization presence highly connected hub nodes approximate scale free topology
common local topological properties include presence recurring patterns interconnections regulation networks 
one goal article describe existing novel network concepts used describe local global network properties
example clustering coefficient network concept measures cohesiveness neighborhood node
particularly interested network concepts defined regard gene significance measure
gene significance measures great practical importance since they allow one incorporate external gene information into network analysis
functional enrichment analysis gene significance measure could indicate pathway membership
gene knock-out experiments gene significance could indicate knock-out essentiality
study gene significance measures since microarray sample trait gives rise statistical measure gene significance
example student t-test differential expression leads gene significance measure
many traditional microarray data analysis methods focus relationship between microarray sample trait gene expression data
example gene filtering methods aim find list genes significantly associated microarray sample trait; another example microarray-based prediction methods aim accurately predict sample trait basis gene expression data
gene expression profiles across microarray samples highly correlated natural describe their pairwise relations using network language
genes similar expression patterns may form complexes pathways participate regulatory signaling circuits
gene coexpression networks been used describe transcriptome many organisms e.g yeast flies worms plants mice humans
gene coexpression network methods also been used typical microarray data analysis tasks gene filtering outcome prediction 
while utility network methods analyzing microarray data been demonstrated numerous publications utility microarray data analysis techniques solving network theoretic problems not yet been fully appreciated
one goal article show simple geometric arguments used derive network theoretic results if networks defined basis correlation matrix
although many our network concepts will useful general networks particularly interested gene coexpression networks
gene coexpression networks built basis gene coexpression measure
network nodes correspond genes more precisely gene expression profiles
ith gene expression profile x i vector whose components report gene expression values across m microarrays
define coexpression similarity s ij between genes i j absolute value correlation coefficient between their expression profiles:formula
using thresholding procedure coexpression similarity transformed into measure connection strength
unweighted network adjacency ij between gene expression profiles x i x j defined hard thresholding coexpression similarity s ij followsformulawhere hard threshold parameter
thus two genes linked if absolute correlation between their expression profiles exceeds threshold
hard thresholding correlation leads simple network concepts but may lead loss information: if been set 0.8 there will no link between two genes if their correlation equals 0.799
preserve continuous nature coexpression information one could simply define weighted adjacency matrix absolute value gene expression correlation matrix i.e ij s ij
however since microarray data noisy number samples often small others found useful emphasize strong correlations punish weak correlations
natural define adjacency between two genes power absolute value correlation coefficient :formulawith 1
soft thresholding approach leads weighted gene coexpression network
present empirical results weighted unweighted networks main text text s1 text s2 text s3
