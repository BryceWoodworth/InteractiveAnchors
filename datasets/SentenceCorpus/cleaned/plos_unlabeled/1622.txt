 introduction 
parkinson's disease degeneration midbrain dopamine neurons severely disrupts neuronal activity looping circuits formed cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical connections  studies shown excessive oscillations at beta frequencies key pathophysiological feature parkinsonian circuits when recorded at level unit activity and/or local field potentials several key circuit nodes
nodes include frontal cortex subthalamic nucleus external globus pallidus internal globus pallidus  suppression pathological beta-activity achieved dopamine replacement therapies surgical treatments e.g high-frequency deep brain stimulation stn; where prolonged attenuation after stimulation observed  bradykinesia rigidity primary motor impairments associated beta activity following dopamine replacement therapies improvements motor deficits correlate reductions beta power  moreover recent report shown stimulating stn at beta frequencies exacerbates motor impairments parkinsonian rodents  line similar findings pd patients 
precisely how dopamine depletion leads abnormal beta power unknown
recent work rodents revealed excessive beta-activity emerges cortex stn after chronic dopamine loss but not after acute dopamine receptor blockade  here examine whether changes effective connectivity between nodes cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network account enhanced beta oscillations following chronic dopamine loss
