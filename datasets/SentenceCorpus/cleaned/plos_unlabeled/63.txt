quorum sensing allows bacteria activate genetic programs cooperatively provides instructive tractable example illuminating causal relationships between molecular organization gene networks complex phenotypes they control
work our knowledge first time present detailed model population-wide transition quorum sensing using example agrobacterium tumefaciens
construct model describing ti plasmid quorum-sensing gene network demonstrate behaves off gene expression switch robust molecular noise activates plasmid conjugation program response increase autoinducer concentration
intracellular model then incorporated into agent-based stochastic population model also describes bacterial motion cell division chemical communication
simulating transition quorum sensing liquid medium biofilm explain experimentally observed gradual manifestation quorum-sensing phenotype showing transition individual model cells into state spread stochastically over broad range autoinducer concentrations
at same time population-averaged values critical autoinducer concentration threshold population density shown robust variability between individual cells predictable specific particular growth conditions
our modeling approach connects intracellular population scales quorum-sensing phenomenon provides plausible answers long-standing questions regarding ecological evolutionary significance phenomenon
thus demonstrate transition quorum sensing requires much higher threshold cell density liquid medium than biofilm basis hypothesize agrobacterium quorum sensing serves detector biofilm formation
 introduction 
molecular networks integrate signal transduction gene expression into unified decision circuitry ultimately responsible realization all life activities biological cells including internal developmental programs responses environmental factors
one main challenges systems biology uncover understand relationships between properties molecular circuits macroscopic cellular phenotypes controlled them
particularly important phenotypes involving interaction cooperative action multiple cells
mapping networks onto phenotypes still difficult accomplish multicellular eukaryotic organisms owing their staggering complexity
less complex more experimentally accessible prokaryotic organisms became systems choice dissecting social behavior at genetic level
phenomenon bacterial quorum sensing gives us particularly unique opportunity follow causal relationships molecular circuitry cooperative population dynamics
qs refers ability bacterial populations collectively activate certain gene expression programs e.g toxin release antibiotic production once some critical population density been reached
qs found vast variety bacterial species been extensively studied experimentally
gram-negative bacteria qs phenomenon usually controlled small gene expression network functions environmentally activated off gene expression switch whose operation analogous radar
at low cell density normally corresponds off switch state key transcription factor required expression proteins responsible phenotype suppressed
at same time cell steadily produces small amount qs signaling molecule termed autoinducer freely diffuse out cell
while population density low most autoinducer molecules washed out dispersed environment diffusion
cell density grows more molecules autoinducer enter bacterium outside
once certain cell quorum reached inbound autoinducer signal triggers transition qs network state resulting production transcription factor expression target genes
transition both intracellular population-wide scales focus our study
investigate phenomenon qs soil-dwelling plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens causative agent crown gall disease
bacteria species often harbor ti plasmids endow their hosts unique ability genetically modify susceptible plants through cross-kingdom dna transfer
like many other soil bacteria agrobacterium chemotactic exudates released plant wounds capable catabolizing various nutrients leave injured plant roots
once bacteria form physical contact surface wound ti plasmids offer their hosts extraordinary advantage over their plasmidless competitors
fragment plasmid termed vir region injected into plant cell form virion-like complex stably incorporated into plant genome
one imported genes responsible synthesis opines class low-molecular-weight nitrogen-rich metabolites utilized nutrient only bacteria harbor ti plasmid
other transferred genes cause vigorous proliferation infected plant cells eventually results formation characteristic gall tumor
once productive infection established ti plasmids attempt propagate themselves into plasmidless bacteria same related species means genetic conjugation
been shown conjugal transfer ti plasmids requires qs phenomenon 
functional significance qs control ti plasmid conjugation remains ecological evolutionary puzzle
widely believed qs controls processes production toxins antibiotics either inefficient devoid adaptive value if not performed population scale
thus fact establishment qs upstream initiation conjugation seems imply plasmids await critical density donors collectively begin transfer recipients
since multiple donors cannot cooperate dna transfer necessity collective action does not seem relevant our case
instead increase probability successful conjugation would appear beneficial exceed certain number recipients per donor
however density plasmidless recipients cannot estimated using qs since they do not produce autoinducer
seemingly paradoxical situation may imply our understanding biological function qs not yet complete
indeed alternative function qs sensor volume enclosing bacteria also been proposed
answer what bacteria really measure using qs each particular situation necessary consider ecologically relevant conditions bacterial growth 
experimental approach problem often complicated technical difficulty work real ecosystems
other hand mathematical modeling significantly aid complement experimental methods answering biological questions involve spatial temporal scales qs phenomenon
some aspects either intracellular population dynamics been mathematically modeled gain insight into qs phenomenon pseudomonas aeruginosa vibrio fischeri
however because lack detailed molecular information experimentally testable conclusions connections between intracellular population dynamics rarely been made
here develop multi-level modeling approach describes both intracellular population-wide dynamics allows us follow connections between them explicitly
although much been learned about molecular details agrobacterium qs network not always clear what functions they perform
here construct detailed model qs network agrobacterium analyze both quantitatively qualitatively
demonstrate network possesses properties off gene expression switch robust molecular noise
further develop population-scale model incorporates bacterial motion cell division chemical communication while explicitly considering individual intracellular dynamics each cell
allows us describe transition qs both cellular population scales quantitatively predict values critical autoinducer concentration threshold cell density functions various intracellular environmental parameters
finally comparing feasibility transition qs homogeneous medium biofilm present hypothesis explaining ecological evolutionary roles qs regulation ti plasmid conjugal transfer
all genes thought constitute qs network located ti plasmid itself
entire qs network controlled upstream availability plant-produced opines ensure energetically expensive conjugation machinery activated only after establishment successful plant wound infection
based chemical nature encoded opines ti plasmids divided into two major types consider only octopine type
reconstructed layout qs network octopine-type ti plasmids published experimental data
plasmid class octopine molecules imported through cell wall eventually cause activation transcription operon occ
model assume octopine constitutively available at saturating concentration results maximal rate occ transcription
last open reading frame operon codes qs transcription activator trar
binding trar its cognate autoinducer thought occur only within narrow window time during trar mrna translation when newly formed protein chain tightly winds around single molecule agrobacterium autoinducer
total engulfment aai molecule makes formation trar aai complex practically irreversible
furthermore trar protein translated absence aai misfolded insoluble unable bind aai
important consequence rate production trar depends concentrations trar mrna aai does not depend accumulation misfolded trar protein explicitly shown figure 1
once formed trar quickly dimerizes form stable transcriptionally active trar dimer relatively short half-life 35 min
trard capable activating number operons encode proteins necessary conjugation
first open reading frame trb operon codes acyl-homoserine lactone synthetase trai utilizes two metabolites abundant bacterial cell create aai
since our model considers transition qs mostly nutrient-rich stress-free conditions optimized growth medium assume substrates trai present excess their concentrations do not limit rate aai production
both trar trai were shown expressed at some low constitutive rate even absence octopine
trar trai couple constitutes classic qs positive feedback loop found many gram-negative bacteria
additional feedback loops also involve other components qs network specific agrobacterium
thus negative control qs provided antiactivator tram whose transcription directly activated trard
tram effectively sequesters trard through formation very stable complex trard unable bind dna
recently number authors reported like trar tram also forms dimer
stoichiometry reaction between trar tram however remains controversial
our model follow original hypothesis swiderska et al assumes complex consists one trard one monomer tram
hypothesis partially supported chen et al who showed tram dimer must dissociate form complex trar
under assumptions disregard dimerization tram not affecting network behavior
additional positive feedback loop arises because trard activates transcription msh operon suboperon occ contains trar itself
several lines evidence suggest active transporters facilitate traffic qs signaling molecules through cell wall number bacterial species including agrobacterium
our model explore hypothesis aai imported environment active pump also under transcriptional control trard
indeed msh operon contains five open reading frames encode putative abc-type importer whose function not completely understood but been hypothesized active transporter aai into cell
taking into consideration uncertainty putative aai importer model denoted simply imp
