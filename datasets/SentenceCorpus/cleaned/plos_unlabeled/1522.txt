 introduction 
important step characterizing genetic regulatory network cell identify dna binding sites recognized each transcription factor protein encoded genome
tf typically activates and/or represses genes associating specific dna sequences
although other factors metabolite binding partners protein-protein interactions affect gene expression important identify sequences directly recognized tfs best our ability understand genes controlled tfs
better understanding gene regulation plays central role cellular responses environmental changes key manipulating cellular behavior variety useful purposes metabolic engineering applications 
number computational methods been developed predicting tf binding sites given set known binding sites
commonly used methods involve definition consensus sequence construction position-specific weight matrix where dna binding sites represented letter sequences alphabet {a t c g}
more sophisticated approaches further constrain set potential binding sites given tf considering addition pwms contribution each nucleotide free energy protein binding additional biologically relevant information nucleotide correlation between different positions sequence sequence-specific binding energies
perhaps not widely used sequence analysis idea employing structural data predicting tf binding sites been considered
most methods use protein-dna structures rather than dna itself
acquiring training sets large enough useful problematic even well-studied tfs only small sets known binding sites typically available
new high-throughput technologies been used identify large numbers binding sites particular tfs but there remains need methods predict tf binding sites given small number positive examples
methods used example complement analysis high-throughput data
binding sites detected high-throughput vitro methods protein-binding microarrays compared predicted binding sites prioritize studies aimed at confirming importance sites regulating gene expression vivo
fine three-dimensional structure dna sequence dependent tf-dna interactions depend various physicochemical parameters contacts between nucleotides amino acid residues base pair geometry
parameters not accounted conventional methods predicting tf binding sites rely sequence information alone
letter representations dna sequences do not capture biophysics underlying tf-dna interactions
given tf does not read off letters dna sequence but interacts particular sequence because its chemical structural features hypothesized better predictions tf binding sites might generated explicitly accounting features algorithm predicting tf binding sites
mechanisms tfs recognize dna sequences divided into two classes: indirect readout direct readout
indirect readout tf recognizes dna sequence via conformation sequence determined local geometry base pair steps distortion flexibility dna sequence protein-dna interactions
direct readout tf recognizes dna sequence through direct contacts between specific bases sequence amino acid residues tf
two classes recognition mechanisms not mutually exclusive

using molecular dynamics methods calculate features map set known potential binding sites given tf vectors structural chemical features
use features positive negative examples tf binding sites train support vector machine discriminate between true false binding sites
negative examples derived randomly selected non-coding dna sequences
positive examples taken regulondb collects information about tfs escherichia coli
classifiers e coli tfs developed through sitesleuth approach evaluated cross validation classifier fis tested against chromatin immunoprecipitation chip assays fis binding sites
combining chip microarray technology chip-chip assays provide information about dna-protein binding vivo genome-wide scale
also evaluate performance sitesleuth against four other computational methods: method berg von hippel matrix search match qpmeme
