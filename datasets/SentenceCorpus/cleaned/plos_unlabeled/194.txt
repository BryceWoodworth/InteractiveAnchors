relies structurally defined interactions each complex components their homologs any other protein irrespective its fold
each component its known binding modes other proteins any fold collected expanded known binding modes its homologs
modes then used restrain conventional molecular docking resulting set binary domain complexes subsequently ranked geometric complementarity statistical potential
method evaluated predicting 20 binary complexes known structure
able correctly identify binding mode 70 percent benchmark complexes compared 30 percent protein docking
applied comparative patch analysis model complex third psd-95 dlg zo-1 domain sh3-gk domains psd-95 protein whose structure unknown
first predicted configuration domains pdz interacts sh3 leaving both gmp-binding site guanylate kinase c-terminus binding cleft pdz accessible while second configuration pdz interacts gk burying both binding sites
suggest two alternate configurations correspond different functional forms psd-95 provide possible structural description experimentally observed cooperative folding transitions psd-95 its homologs
more generally expect comparative patch analysis will provide useful spatial restraints structural characterization increasing number binary higher-order protein complexes
 introduction 
protein protein interactions play key role many cellular processes
important step towards mechanistic description processes structural characterization proteins their complexes
currently there two computational approaches predict structure protein complex given structures its components comparative modeling protein protein docking 
first approach modelling target complex standard comparative modelling threading methods build model using known structure homologous complex template
applicability approach limited currently sparse structural coverage binary interactions
second approach atomic model predicted protein protein docking starting structures individual subunits without any consideration homologous interactions
docking usually achieved maximizing shape physicochemical complementarity two protein structures through generating scoring large set possible configurations
experimental information obtained nmr chemical shift mapping residual dipolar couplings cross-linking also used guide protein docking
while docking applicable any two subunits whose structures known modeled both sampling relevant configurations discrimination native-like configurations large number non-native alternatives remain challenging 
here propose third approach modeling complexes between two structures
approach called comparative patch analysis hybrid protein docking comparative modeling based template complex greater applicability than comparative modeling higher accuracy than docking
comparative patch analysis relies our prior analysis location binding sites within families homologous domains
analysis indicated locations binding sites often conserved irrespective folds their binding partners
structure target complex thus modeled restricting protein docking only those binding sites employed homologous domains
result comparative patch analysis benefits knowledge all interactions involving either one two partners
find comparative patch analysis increases prediction accuracy relative protein docking
able correctly identify binding mode 70 percent 20 benchmark complexes predicting overall structure average improvement all-atom rms error 13.4 compared protein docking
contrast protein docking correctly identifies binding mode 30 percent complexes
