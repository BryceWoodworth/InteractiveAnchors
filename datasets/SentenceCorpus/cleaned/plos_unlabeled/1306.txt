previous theoretical studies fast rhythms other brain areas proposed principle neuron synchrony mediated short-latency rapidly decaying inhibition
phasic inhibition provides narrow time window principle neurons fire thus promoting synchrony
however olfactory bulb inhibitory granule cells produce long lasting small amplitude asynchronous aperiodic inhibitory input thus narrow time window required synchronize spiking does not exist
instead been suggested correlated output granule cells could serve synchronize uncoupled mitral cells through mechanism called stochastic synchronization wherein synchronization arises through correlation inputs two neural oscillators
almost all work synchrony due correlations presumes correlation imposed fixed
building theory experiments others developed show increased synchrony mitral cells could produce increase granule cell activity those granule cells share synchronous group mitral cells
common granule cell input increases input correlation mitral cells hence their synchrony providing positive feedback loop correlation
thus demonstrate emergence temporal evolution input correlation recurrent networks feedback
explore several theoretical models idea ranging spiking models analytically tractable model
 introduction 
synchronization neural activity been suggested facilitate coding propagation activity
synchronous stimulus-induced oscillatory activity long been known occur olfactory system mammals
synchronous rhythmic activity been proposed play role odor discrimination tasks
insects disruption synchronous oscillations impair discrimination chemically similar odorants
mice enhancement synchronous oscillations olfactory bulb using genetic modifications improves performance fine discrimination tasks
mammalian olfactory system mitral cell synchrony contributes generation gamma oscillations local field potential; example cat olfactory system increases synchrony between mitral cells accompanied concomitant increase power gamma band local field potential
mitral cells been shown undergo synchronization during odor-evoked responses during olfactory nerve stimulation
although previous experimental modeling studies highlighted role granule cells lateral inhibition production gamma oscillations olfactory bulb exact mechanism mitral cell synchronization occurs mitral-granule cell network connected reciprocal recurrent lateral connections remains largely unknown
possible mechanism synchronization mitral cells olfactory bulb suggested recent experimental evidence
paired recordings mitral cells activation mitral cell elicits fast unitary inhibitory post-synaptic potentials second mitral cell
ipsc's due synaptic activation shared granule cells via mitral-granule cell dendrodendritic synapses
although individual ipsc's fast they arrive randomly i.e output granule cells not time locked stimulus
temporally prolonged barrage unitary ipsc's produced response spiking first mitral cell results slow rising long lasting hyperpolarization second mitral cell
there variable delay between evoked ipsc's second mitral cell spike times first mitral cell
thus evoked ipsc's occur asynchronously aperiodically kinetics hyperpolarization ensemble average evoked ipsc's show slow rise time slow decay constant
addition peak amplitudes ensemble average small
prolonged asynchronous barrages ipsc's been shown result long latency asynchronous long lasting mitral cell recruitment granule cells
furthermore recent experimental studies into origin synchrony between mitral cells suggests recovery shared ipsc inputs common granule cells primary driving mechanism mitral cell synchrony
physiologically measured properties mitral-granule cell interactions suggest novel mechanism synchronization mitral cells olfactory bulb
previous studies proposed noise synchronize oscillators
neurons undergo noise-induced synchronization they should periodically firing should some shared fast fluctuations their inputs
recent studies mechanism generation synchronized oscillatory activity long lasting asynchronous aperiodic inhibition olfactory bulb revealed exactly novel role noise
was shown two mitral cells firing gamma frequency range undergo synchronization upon receiving common inhibitory input granule cells
degree synchronization was shown depend degree correlation noisy input shared two neurons
although spiking was synchronized shared noise itself was aperiodic
all experimental theoretical studies stochastic synchronization date degree correlation imposed held fixed
our study degree input correlation emerges intrinsically within network amplified over time due dynamics network
addition our study utilizes theoretically derived probability distribution phase difference uncoupled oscillators receiving shared noise investigate conditions necessary existence bistability magnitude input correlation
here consider case correlated fluctuations granule cells arise naturally granule cells connect many mitral cells
input correlation any pair mitral cells could increase if shared pool presynaptic granule cells increased their stochastic firing rate thus providing greater amount common noise
olfactory bulb synapses between mitral granule cells dendrodendritic almost always reciprocal
thus if granule cell synapses pair mitral cells those mitral cells also synapse granule cell
hypothesize since pair mitral cells correlated input more likely fire synchronously pair also more likely provide correlated input their common granule cell
turn common granule cell could then increases its release transmitter increasing correlation mitral cells
result feedback provides amplification correlation
goal paper use computational analytic techniques show feedback will increase correlation consequence synchrony between oscillating mitral cells
describe three models feedback induced correlation stochastic sychronization
first study one pair mitral cells one common granule cell
mitral cells modeled simple phase oscillators perturbed through their phase-resetting curves
granule cell modeled noisy leaky integrate fire neuron receiving synaptic input mitral cell oscillators
second model replaces each phase oscillator conductance-based morris-lecar oscillator
finally allow analytic approaches reduce first two models discrete time map study using averaging technique
