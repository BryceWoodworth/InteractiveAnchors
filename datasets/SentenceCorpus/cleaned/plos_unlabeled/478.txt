 introduction 
despite relatively small number genes human genome there many examples groups nearly identical genes perform similar functions
diversity could either reflect redundancy evolutionary specialization
specialization could result tuning different functional environments nearly identical genes might play very different functional roles 
here explore how functional constraints bound shape evolution through analysis mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels
primary function voltage-gated sodium channels allow propagation action potentials
since hodgkin huxley mathematical models suggested sodium channel properties need tightly constrained action potential propagate
mammals there nine different genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels many more than 90 percent identical sequence
one hand sequence similarity channels presumably corresponds similarity their functional properties; consistent idea properties must tightly constrained
other hand multiplicity genes encoding sodium channels raises question: why so many different mechanisms generating action potential necessary
sodium channels predominantly found specific anatomical regions suggesting they might tuned specific functions
example channels na v1.1 na v1.2 na v1.3 na v1.6 na v1.7 predominantly localized central peripheral nervous systems; na v1.8 na v1.9 primarily dorsal root ganglion; na v1.4 primarily at skeletal muscular junctions; na v1.5 primarily cardiac tissue 
paper address questions whether how sodium channel diversity bounded simplest theoretical constraints action potential propagation: sodium channel properties must tuned allow membrane excitable i.e there must exist voltage threshold above action potential produced constraint unique resting potential
through theoretical analysis macroscopic sodium currents demonstrate two requirements depend only sodium channel properties directly constraining activation inactivation curves sodium channels routinely directly measured experiments
then compare constraints measurements mammalian sodium channels reported literature
our dataset uses 172 different measurements 40 distinct publications including both wild-type mutant na v1.1 1.9 human mouse rat under range different conditions including without different types subunits chemicals
mutant channels tend associated disease state hence presumably differ physiologically significant way wild-type
our analysis demonstrates excitability properties alone distinguish nine sodium channels into four different groups
within each group there strong positive correlation between voltage dependence activation inactivation
members each four groups close according phylogenetic analysis
what functional differences between groups
two groups correspond channels expressed nerve muscle tissue respectively
another group potential voltage threshold substantially higher than other channels
final group only produce action potentials narrow conductance range even then maximum voltage threshold less than thermal fluctuations
separation channels into functionally distinct groups suggests they evolved perform specialized tasks
