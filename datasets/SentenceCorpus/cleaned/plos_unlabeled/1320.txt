 
kinetically stable proteins those whose stability derived their slow unfolding kinetics not thermodynamics examples evolution's best attempts at suppressing unfolding
especially highly proteolytic environments both partially fully unfolded proteins face potential inactivation through degradation and/or aggregation hence slowing unfolding greatly extend protein's functional lifetime
prokaryotic serine protease lytic protease done just its unfolding both very slow so cooperative partial unfolding negligible providing functional advantage over its thermodynamically stable homologs trypsin
previous studies identified regions domain interface critical lp unfolding though complete description unfolding pathway missing
order identify lp unfolding pathway mechanism its extreme cooperativity performed high temperature molecular dynamics unfolding simulations both lp trypsin
simulated lp unfolding pathway produces robust transition state ensemble consistent prior biochemical experiments clearly shows unfolding proceeds through preferential disruption domain interface
through novel method calculating unfolding cooperativity show lp unfolds extremely cooperatively while trypsin unfolds gradually
finally examining behavior both domain interfaces propose model differential unfolding cooperativity lp trypsin involving three key regions differ between kinetically stable thermodynamically stable classes serine proteases
 introduction 
lytic protease prokaryotic serine protease chymotrypsin family evolved unusual energetic landscape providing functional advantage over its metazoan homologs
unlike most proteins lp's active state not stabilized thermodynamics but large kinetic barrier unfolding unfolding t 1/2 1 year
while thermodynamically stable homologs like trypsin similar unfolding rates they degraded at rates up 100x faster than lp under highly proteolytic conditions
addition rates lp unfolding degradation nearly identical indicating partial unfolding leading proteolysis negligible
therefore lp's functional advantage derived not only its very slow unfolding shares trypsin but also its suppression local unfolding events would render protease-accessible
thus appears evolution lp generated extreme cooperativity unfolding order maximize its functional lifetime under harsh conditions
cost maximizing resistance unfolding comes form extremely slow folding consequent loss thermodynamic stability active state relative unfolded state
however lp also evolved large pro-region folding catalyst speeds folding nine orders magnitude then degraded mature protease decoupling folding unfolding landscapes so unfolding resistance maximized

given lp's unusual energetic landscape its reliance kinetic stability much effort focused elucidating its unfolding mechanism detail
native-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange showed over half its 194 backbone amides well-protected exchange 31 protection factors greater than 10 9
extreme rigidity spread throughout both domains indicative lp's high unfolding cooperativity
thermodynamic decomposition unfolding energetics into entropic enthalpic contributions suggested prominent role extensive domain interface unfolding critical step involving solvation domain interface while individual domains remain relatively intact
mutational studies lp inspired acid-resistant homolog napase were consistent hypothesis
distribution salt-bridges napase lp differ markedly; replacement salt-bridge at lp's domain interface intra-domain salt-bridge resulted significant increases lp's resistance low ph unfolding
major component domain interface domain bridge only covalent linkage between two domains
structure exists only prokaryotic proteases varies considerably among lp its homologs
area buried domain bridge inversely correlated high-temperature unfolding rate four kinetically stable proteases indicating both its relevance weakened early unfolding
another domain interface component hairpin c-terminal domain unique kinetically stable proteases forms part active site
substitution more stable turn was consistent unfolding pathway where c h loses its domain interface contacts early unfolding
despite much progress still lack global picture lp unfolding especially at high resolution
higher-resolution views protein folding/unfolding researchers often turned value analysis
studies involve large-scale protein engineering experiments investigate molecule's folding unfolding kinetics after making perturbing mutations normally hydrophobic deletions
analyzing sufficiently large numbers perturbations structure transition state ensemble inferred folding/unfolding mechanism proposed
unfortunately extremely slow folding unfolding rates lp make large-scale value analysis lp impractical
alternative decided investigate lp unfolding pathway computationally order explain previous experiments guide new ones
high-temperature molecular dynamics unfolding simulations offer highest structural temporal resolution studying protein unfolding but their results must validated experimentally
since unfolding rates proteins typically very slow under physiological conditions very high temperatures required accelerate unfolding into ns range required computational analysis
consequence initially there was significant concern relevance high temperature tses real proteins under physiological conditions
daggett co-workers been pioneers field using chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 model system shown simulated unfolding calculations agree remarkably well experimental values were even able predict faster folding mutants
further work other proteins multiple groups established md unfolding simulations useful tool examining protein unfolding at atomic resolution while correlating well experiments

critical step analyzing unfolding simulations accurately pinpointing tse multitude conformations generated
because tse experimentally accessible through molecule's folding unfolding kinetics its identification computationally used both explanatory predictive purposes
various methods identifying tse been used past breaking down into conformational clustering landscape methods
conformational clustering relies all-versus-all comparisons conformations often c rmsd while landscapes separating native unfolded structures generated using properties conformations fraction native contacts secondary structure
here report results multiple md simulations carried out at high temperature order probe mechanism lp's extremely cooperative unfolding
due robustness cooperativity lp unfolding same tse obtained using either conformational clustering landscape methods
simulated unfolding pathway lp matches well previously described experiments provides atomic resolution previous models lp unfolding highlight role domain interface
addition performed similar simulations trypsin goal understanding observed experimental differences unfolding cooperativity
through novel method calculating cooperativity md simulations show lp unfolds significantly more cooperatively than trypsin mirroring experimental results
finally analyzing domain interfaces both proteins during unfolding propose mechanism how differential cooperativity achieved
