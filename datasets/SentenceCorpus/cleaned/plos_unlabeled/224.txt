 introduction 
apoptosis evolutionary conserved form cell suicide allows multicellular organisms eliminate damaged excess cells order maintain tissue homeostasis
dysregulation apoptosis associated various pathological conditions including cancer neurodegenerative disorders
aspartate-specific cysteine proteases also known caspases central executioners apoptosis
most cases apoptotic stimuli activate initiator caspases whose substrates effector caspases ultimatively cause cellular demise cleaving various cellular substrates 
figure 1a schematically depicts so-called extrinsic intrinsic apoptotic pathways elicit apoptosis cleaving thereby activating caspase-3 major cellular effector caspase
extrinsic pathway initiated ligand-binding death receptors then oligomerize recruit various proteins including pro-casp8 into so-called death-inducing signaling complex
formation death-inducing signaling complex leads autoprocessing pro-casp8 into active casp8 then cleaves casp3
cytotoxic stress death-receptor stimulated casp8 engage intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway inducing translocation proapoptotic bcl-2 family members bax bid mitochondria
event negatively regulated antiapoptotic bcl-2 family members results release proapoptotic proteins mitochondria into cytosol
cytosolic cyto c then elicits oligomerization apaf-1 into active high-molecular-weight complex apoptosome recruits stimulates casp9 thereby allows activation effector caspases casp3
smac inhibitors apoptosis x-linked iap establish additional layer regulation intrinsic pathway: xiap inhibits catalytic activities casp9 casp3 through reversible binding cytosolic smac relieves inhibition sequestering xiap away caspases 
experimental studies revealed qualitative behaviour caspase activation intrinsic pathway depends cellular context
cyto c added cytosolic extracts activates casp3 all-or-none fashion some cells while gradual activation was observed other systems
cyto-c release mitochondria reversible event does not affect mitochondrial function been suggested downstream caspase activation irreversibly commits cells apoptosis
accordingly cyto c induced casp3 activation remained elevated even after strong decline cytosolic cyto c after apo cyto c inhibitor apoptosome formation was added
furthermore time course caspase activation via intrinsic pathway equals irreversible commitment apoptosis caspase-inhibition allows long-term cellular recovery and/or proliferation after removal apoptotic stimuli
finally fas-treated jurkat t cells enter apoptosis intrinsic pathway escaped commitment death judged maintenance clonogenic potential if casp3 was inhibited
contrary casp3 activation was found reversible event glycochenodeoxycholate-treated hepatocytes 
qualitative differences caspase activation suggest intrinsic pathway bistable some cells but monostable others
while simple monostable systems respond gradual reversible manner complex bistable systems exhibit true all-or-none responses some cases irreversibility
bistability thought require positive circuit may established either positive feedback double-negative feedback
once threshold stimulus exceeded positive circuits allow bistable systems switch low activation levels high activation levels all-or-none fashion
bistable systems display hysteresis meaning different stimulus-response curves obtained depending upon whether system began its off its state
some cases state maintained indefinitely after stimulus removed so system shows irreversible activation
experimental studies confirmed bistability indeed occurs natural artificial biological networks 
recent mathematical modeling demonstrated bistability arise hidden implicit feedback loops usually not explicitly drawn biochemical reaction schemes
similarily present model showing inhibition casp3 casp9 iaps results implicit positive feedback bistability
cellular inhibitory proteins frequently inhibit consecutive intermediates cellular signaling cascades mechanism described paper likely widespread principle how cells achieve ultrasensitivity bistability irreversibility
