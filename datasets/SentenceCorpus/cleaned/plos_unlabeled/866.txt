 
evolution cooperation described terms simple two-person interactions received considerable attention recent years where several key results were obtained
among those now well established web social interaction networks promotes emergence cooperation when modeled terms symmetric two-person games
up until now however impacts heterogeneity social interactions into emergence cooperation not been fully explored other aspects remain investigated
here carry out study employing simplest example prisoner's dilemma game benefits collected participants may proportional costs expended
show heterogeneous nature social network naturally induces symmetry breaking game contributions made cooperators may become contingent social context individual embedded
new numerical mean-field analysis reveals prisoner's dilemmas networks no longer constitute defector dominance dilemma instead individuals engage effectively general coordination game
find symmetry breaking induced population structure profoundly affects evolutionary dynamics cooperation dramatically enhancing feasibility cooperators: cooperation blooms when each cooperator contributes same cost equally shared among plethora games she participates
work provides clear evidence while individual rational reasoning may hinder cooperative actions intricate nature social interactions may effectively transform local dilemma cooperation into global coordination problem
 introduction 
portuguese no exception: like any other language many proverbs popular sayings
one them states something like: i already contributed charity concerning originally situations individuals faced decision offering contribution common venture expression above meaning no
interestingly amount given never stated
turns out quite often confronted situations act giving more important than amount given
let us keep charity event some celebrities invited participate
typically their appearance given maximal audience they shown contributing seemingly large amount money charity's cause
offer aimed at stimulating contribution many same charity indeed mechanism celebrity participation charities common presumably effective
but what relevance amount contributed celebrity
certainly impressive many despite being most likely small contribution both face celebrity's wealth also what concerns overall amount accumulated
but does induce hopefully large number contributions anonymous charity participants who feel compelled contribute given fact their role model contributed
other words majority copies act giving but certainly not amount given
nowadays web-signed petitions also examples collective decisions often benefit fact some well-known people adhere petition's cause
besides those who fully aware agree cause there also those who sign petition simply because they admire someone who signed petition again copying attitude
many other examples real life could provided along similar lines trivia fads stock markets humanitarian causes up salvation planet earth
theoretical perspective many situations provide beautiful examples public goods games often hard dissociate reputation building social norms moral principles
intricate interplay reflects many-body nature multi-level complexity interactions among social atoms 
simplest pgg involves two persons
both opportunity contribute cost c common pool
cooperator one who contributes; otherwise she defector
total amount multiplied enhancement factor f equally shared between two participants
hence player i using strategy s i gets payoff formula game leading following payoff matrixformula
formula ds dominate unconditionally
f 2 no strategy favored well mixed populations ; yet formula better play c despite fact mixed pair d collects higher payoff than c formula game example famous symmetric one-shot two-person prisoner's dilemma many central results been obtained over years particular context evolutionary game theory : 1992 been explicitly shown population structure matters despite its importance being recognized already darwin albeit form group selection
clearly makes difference whether everybody equally likely interact anybody else population not
2004 learnt evolutionary game theory finite populations may behave very differently infinite populations even absence any population structure evolutionarily stable strategies becoming population size dependent
2005 learnt heterogeneous population structures play important role evolution cooperation under prisoner's other social dilemmas result spawned number investigations
2006 mathematical condition was obtained cs become advantageous populations structured along links homogeneous networks subsequently confirmed making use inclusive fitness methods limited subset game payoff matrices
result valid limit weak selection also unraveled important feature evolutionary game theoretical studies: outcome cooperation depends evolutionary dynamics adopted dictating how individual strategy evolves generation generation
furthermore evolutionary game dynamics populations structured along multiple networks been explored well mechanisms favor cooperation under adaptive population structures been identified both non-repeated repeated games
results consubstantiate keep stimulating enormous amount research work
common all studies settings underlying social dilemma: conventional view every c pays fixed cost c per game providing same benefit b partner
however if what matters act giving not amount given then there no reason assume everybody contributes same cost c each game
depending amount each individual contribution overall result evolutionary dynamics may change
two person game introduced above provides not only ideal ground introduce diversity contributions but also intuitive coupling between game dynamics social embedding: first individual contributes cost c 1 if playing c nothing otherwise
hence player i now gets following payoff game:formulareflecting symmetry breaking induced possibly different contributions different cooperating individuals
poses natural question: who will acquire evolutionary edge under conditions
often amount each individual contributes correlated social context she actually embedded
modern communities grounded complex social networks investment cooperation some individuals play radically different roles interact more more often than others
empirical studies demonstrated social networks share both small-world properties heterogeneous distribution connectivities
heterogeneous communities where different individuals may embedded very different social environments indeed hard imagine every c will always provide same amount every game interaction hence reducing problem standard two-person prisoner's dilemma studied so far
context n-person games played prototypical social networks been found diversity contributions greatly favors cooperation
however similar relation between two-body many-body interactions physical sciences n-person public goods games intrinsic complexity cannot anticipated two-person games: words late william hamilton theory many person games may seem stand two-person games relation sea-sickness headache 
here besides conventional scenario every c contributes same cost c each game she participates shall also explore limit every c contributes same overall amount c however amount shared between all games she participates defined social network players embedded
instance c may interpreted availability amount resources each individual dedicate all her commitments
hence contribution each game will depend now social context each c heterogeneity will foster symmetry breaking pair-wise interactions two individuals may contribute different amounts same game
sense cooperation will identified act giving no longer amount given
