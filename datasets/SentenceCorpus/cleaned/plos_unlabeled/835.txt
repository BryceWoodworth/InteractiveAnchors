 
extent self-adopted intervention-related changes behaviors affect course epidemics remains key issue outbreak control
study attempted quantify effect changes risk infection different settings i.e community hospitals
2002 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak hong kong where 27 percent cases were healthcare workers was used example
stochastic compartmental seir model was used: population was split into healthcare workers hospitalized people general population
super spreading events were taken into account model
temporal evolutions daily effective contact rates community hospitals were modeled smooth functions
data augmentation techniques markov chain monte carlo methods were applied estimate sars epidemiological parameters
particular estimates daily reproduction numbers were provided each subpopulation
average duration sars infectious period was estimated 9.3 days
model was able disentangle impact two sses background transmission rates
effective contact rates were estimated daily basis decreased time reaching zero inside hospitals
observation suggests public health measures possible changes individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission especially hospitals
temporal patterns reproduction numbers were similar healthcare workers general population indicating average infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person
provide general method estimate time dependence parameters structured epidemic models enables investigation impact control measures behavioral changes different settings
 introduction 
emerging infectious diseases been defined infections newly appeared population existed previously but rapidly increasing incidence geographic range
several features may make them particularly threatening
first recognizing disease difficult when first cases appear especially when symptoms non-specific
second no vaccine specific treatment may known initially
moreover heterogeneities disease transmission may create high-risk groups healthcare workers high-risk geographical areas thereby dramatically enhancing impact outbreak 
2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak hong kong remarkably illustrative above issues: symptoms were similar pneumonia ; incubation period was long enough local international transmission occur ; no vaccine treatment was available; much 21 percent cases worldwide were healthcare workers
outbreak also demonstrated possible existence super-spreading events during few infectious individuals contaminated high number secondary cases
hong kong had two sses: first occurred hospital x around march 3 led about 125 cases ; second occurred housing estate y march 19 led over 300 cases
despite its particularly threatening features outbreak was brought under control
context once epidemic detected spontaneous changes behavior will occur non-pharmacological measures usually initiated control outbreak
resulting effects two phenomena disease transmission not easily quantified
effective contact rate reflects combined influences social proximity probability infection through each contact essential determinant disease spread
our aim was estimate temporal variation parameter community hospitals over course outbreak
previously published mathematical models parameter estimation addressed issues temporal variability social heterogeneity
here present approach deals both issues together occurrence sses
then method applied 2003 sars epidemic hong kong
