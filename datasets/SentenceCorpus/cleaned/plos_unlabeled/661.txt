here examined whether functional organization disrupted alzheimer's disease
task-free fmri data 21 ad subjects 18 age-matched controls were obtained
wavelet analysis was applied fmri data compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices
correlation matrices were thresholded create 90-node undirected-graphs functional brain networks
small-world metrics were computed using graph analytical methods
low frequency interval 0.01 0.05 hz functional brain networks controls showed small-world organization brain activity characterized high clustering coefficient low characteristic path length
contrast functional brain networks ad showed loss small-world properties characterized significantly lower clustering coefficient indicative disrupted local connectivity
clustering coefficients left right hippocampus were significantly lower ad group compared control group
furthermore clustering coefficient distinguished ad participants controls sensitivity 72 percent specificity 78 percent
our study provides new evidence there disrupted organization functional brain networks ad
small-world metrics characterize functional organization brain ad our findings further suggest network measures may useful imaging-based biomarker distinguish ad healthy aging
 introduction 
alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative disorder characterized progressive impairment episodic memory other cognitive domains resulting dementia ultimately death
imaging studies ad begun shift studies brain structure more recent studies highlighting focal regions abnormal brain function
most recently fmri studies moved beyond focal activation abnormalities dysfunctional brain connectivity
functional connectivity defined temporal correlations between spatially distinct brain regions
pet studies restricted across-subject connectivity measures shown ad patients decreased hippocampus connectivity prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate cortex during memory tasks
using fmri demonstrated ad patients performing simple motor task had reduced intra-subject functional connectivity within network brain regions termed default-mode network includes posterior cingulate cortex temporoparietal junction hippocampus
bokde et al reported abnormalities fusiform gyrus connectivity during face-matching task subjects mild cognitive impairment frequently precursor ad
three recent studies reported reduced default-mode network deactivation mci and/or ad patients during encoding tasks during semantic classification task
celone et al also reported increased default-mode network deactivation subset less impaired mci patients
addition analyzing functional connectivity during task performance functional connectivity also been investigated during task-free conditions
task-free functional connectivity mri detects interregional correlations spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuations
using approach wang et al found disrupted functional connectivity between hippocampus several neocortical regions ad
similarly li et al reported reduced intrahippocampal connectivity during task-free conditions
most recently sorg et al reported reduced resting-state functional connectivity default-mode network mci patients
although evidence accumulating ad disrupts functional connections between brain regions not clear whether ad disrupts global functional brain organization
graph metrics clustering coefficient characteristic path length useful measures global organization large-scale networks
graphs data structures nodes edges between nodes
clustering coefficient measure local network connectivity
network high average clustering coefficient characterized densely connected local clusters
characteristic path length measure how well connected network network low characteristic path length characterized short distances between any two nodes
small-world network characterized high clustering coefficient low characteristic path length
graphical representation brain network node corresponds brain region while edge corresponds functional interaction between two brain regions
functional connectivity networks human brain derived electroencephalograms magnetoencephalograms task-free fmri data exhibit small-world characteristics
recent eeg study stam et al reported small-world architecture functional networks brain disrupted ad 
here examined global functional organization brain ad creating whole-brain functional connectivity networks task-free fmri data characterizing organization networks using small-world metrics comparing characteristics between ad patients age-matched controls
hypothesized global functional brain organization would abnormal ad
further given need reliable non-invasive clinical test ad sought determine whether small-world metric obtained task-free fmri data might provide sensitive specific biomarker ad
