 introduction 
transposable elements mobile repetitive dna sequences constitute structurally dynamic component genomes
taxonomic distribution tes virtually ubiquitous: they been found nearly all eukaryotic organisms studied few exceptions
tes represent quantitatively important components genome sequences there no doubt modern genomic dna evolved close association tes
tes show high species specificity number types te differ quite dramatically between even closely related organisms
there abundant circumstantial evidence tes may transfer horizontally between species mechanisms remain obscure
forces controlling dynamics te spread within species also poorly understood systemic effects elements their host genomes
insertions individual tes may lead genome restructuring mutations genes changes gene regulation
some te insertions may even become domesticated play roles normal functions host
despite their manifold effects abundance ubiquity understand very little about most aspects te biology
one way furthering our knowledge te biology through computational analysis tes growing number complete genomic sequences
detailed comparison abundance distribution tes entire genomes infer fundamental biological properties tes shared differ among species
however meaningful inferences about te biology based computationally derived te annotations only done if confident about results analyses
hallmark strong result computational biology should its robustness particular method used
annotation tes however typically relies results single computational program repeatmasker recent studies indicate may neither most efficient nor most sensitive approach te annotation
contrast recent advances field gene annotation indicate high-quality gene models produced combining multiple independent sources computational evidence
recent development several new methods te repeat detection now possible apply similar combined evidence approach elevate quality te annotations level comparable gene models
achieve aim developed te annotation pipeline integrates results multiple homology-based de novo te identification methods
currently our pipeline uses combined computational evidence derived repeatmasker blaster tblastx all-by-all blastn recon te-hmm previously published te annotations
designed our system use evidence-model framework apollo genome annotation tool allowing computational evidence manually curated efficient manner produce reliable te models
pipeline allows rapid thorough annotation complex te models providing key structural details allow insights into origin highly deleted and/or nested elements
contrast simply masking repeats our method provides means complete accurate annotation tes supported multiple sources computational evidence goal important implications experimental studies genome chromosome biology
test case chosen annotate euchromatic genomic sequence fruit fly drosophila melanogaster
116.8-mb release 3 genome sequence d melanogaster among highest quality genome sequences particularly well suited sequence genome-wide studies tes since repetitive dna sequences been finished high quality systematically verified restriction fingerprint analysis
moreover release 3.1 annotation d melanogaster includes manually curated set te annotations used benchmark developing refining te annotation methodologies
controlled tests performed here release 3 sequence show combined-evidence approach superior performance over individual te detection methods substantially larger fraction genome composed tes than previously estimated
applied our pipeline new 118.4-mb release 4 sequence closed several gaps release 3 extended sequence pericentomeric regions produce systematic re-annotation tes d melanogaster genome
euchromatic te fraction now estimated at 5.3 percent found substantially higher number tes than previously identified
also estimated 518 te copies inserted into at least one other te forming nest elements
our pipeline easily adapted other genome sequences could markedly increase efficiency annotating genomic regions complex abundant te insertions heterochromatic sequences
