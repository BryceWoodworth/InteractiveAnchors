 introduction 
acetylcholinesterase rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine terminate neurotransmissions at cholinergic synapses
reaction very fast approaching diffusion limit
ache three different molecular forms due alternate splicing scheme at c-terminus
t-subtype 40-residue c-terminal t-peptide only form expressed brain adult muscles normal adult mammals
vertebrate cholinergic synapses tetramers ache t associated either collagen-like q subunit transmembrane proline-rich membrane-anchoring protein
colq structural protein anchors ache t synaptic basal lamina prima membrane protein anchors ache t membrane neuronal synapses brain
they both contain proline-rich attachment domain near n-terminus site interacting t-peptide ache
prad three five consecutive proline residues been shown synthetic polyproline could replace prad its association ache t tetramers
ache t t-peptide absolutely required its association prad
sequence t-peptide highly conserved throughout vertebrates cysteine at 4 position c-terminus series seven aromatic residues including four equally spaced tryptophans
because t-peptide constitutes autonomous interacting domain been named tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domain
notation ache t equivalent ache wat 
recently crystal structure prad/wat complex was solved at 2.35 resolution
complex expected wat 4prad stoichiometry
four parallel helical wat chains wrap around single antiparallel prad helix itself left-handed polyproline ii conformation
each wat helix assumes coiled-coil conformation all four them form left-handed supercoil around prad
www motif wat makes repetitive hydrophobic stacking hydrogen bond interactions prad
four wat chains related 4-fold screw axis around prad
strength prad wat interaction very tight no monomer wat detected range 10 10 10 12 m 
remains unknown how four ache subunits arranged tetramer associated prad
low-resolution crystallographic studies revealed two distinct three-dimensional structures ache tetramer
both crystal structures show dimer dimers i.e there no 4-fold symmetry relate all four subunits
one structure two ache dimers close all four c-terminal sequences aligning same direction other structure space between two dimers large four c-terminal sequences aligned antiparallel middle
crystals were grown trypsin-digested collagen-tailed ache should both wat prad preserved; although electronic densities were seen was not possible resolve them
was suggested flexibility ache tetramers might related regulation catalysis
test reaction-rate calculations were conducted using two tetramer structures morphed intermediate structure
results showed rate per active site was reduced due active site occlusion sink sink competition compared monomeric form but could partly compensated electrostatic enhancements tetramers
rate reduction due active site occlusion was particularly notable compact tetramer 
efforts combine prad/wat structure two ache tetramer structures were not very successful
problem was both tetramer structures four ache subunits lacked 4-fold symmetry seen wat 4prad complex crystal structure
since four wat chains staggered structure impossible without substantial distortion wat 4prad complex and/or ache tetramer structures dock wat 4prad complex along 2-fold axis between pairs ache dimers
fact superhelical axis wat 4prad complex structure at angle about 30 2-fold axis 
considering tight association between prad wat weak affinity ache dimer limited contact between two dimers tetramer reasonable assume prad wat interaction dominates over inter-subunit interaction association ache tetramer colq
fact ache only exists soluble monomer if wat sequence deleted indicating dimerization forces weak
previous study subunit association cholinesterases interaction was identified weak hydrophobic interaction compared strong interaction seen between wat prad
also been shown if two proteins example ache alkaline phosphatase both wat sequences at their c-termini mixed prad at various ratios tetramers containing three subunits one protein one other underrepresented
points symmetric ache t 4 colq complex form physiological conditions
since two crystal structures ache tetramer were generated experimentally they accessible physiological model through conformational changes
study built ache t 4 colq complex model strictly following prad wat interaction
although molecular dynamics useful tool observe dynamics conformational changes size system poses too much challenge case
block normal mode analysis uses coarse-grained representation protein reduce computational cost been shown useful tool predicting low-frequency motions seen large protein assemblies example swelling virus capsid ratchet motion ribosome collective motions hiv-1 transcriptase myosin atpase chaperonin groel etc low-frequency motions often related conformational changes required biological functions protein assemblies
here applied bnma ache t 4 colq complex model calculated 100 lowest normal modes
projecting conformational changes onto normal modes was found two ache tetramer crystal structures could rationalized using low-frequency normal modes
