 introduction 
cerebral cortical patterns fascinated scientists centuries their beauty complexity
numerous groups relate malformations sulcal patterns different diseases humans autism attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
though many advances occurred cortical development sulcogenesis understanding how sulci form what factors determine placement sulci still limited
cerebral cortex across species displays variety shapes sizes also wide array sulcal patterning
studying evolutionary development sulcal patterns might provide clues about cortical development taking place humans
major advance determining how sulcal patterns form was introduction axonal tension hypothesis
hypothesis describes mechanically-based scenario where axonal tension created developing corticocortical connections strongly interconnected regions pulls together gyral walls creates folding pattern
hypothesis furthered concept variability between folding patterns among individuals genetically driven not just consequence random mechanical buckling confined cortex
other mechanochemical models also been proposed explain morphogenesis central nervous system 
recently been suggested cortical pattern arise based regional patterns intermediate progenitor cells subventricular zone
intermediate progenitor model builds upon intermediate progenitor cell hypothesis states during development cortex certain radial glial cells ventricular zone activated create ip cells travel svz
ip cells amplify amount neurons created given radial column
furthermore subset ip cells creates local amplification neurons upper cortical layers surrounded areas non-amplification resulting wedge shape cortex
wedge shape representative gyrus
new hypothesis still being debated if correct could scenario chemically-based pattern formation cortex
here relatively simple believe elegant chemically-driven mathematical model proposed explain how ip cell subsets distributed spatially temporally developing cortex
our model call global intermediate progenitor model uses turing reaction-diffusion system containing activator inhibitor prolate spheroidal surface determine regional areas activation production ip cells
gip model allows determination placement initial sulci underlying observed complex cortical patterns
also demonstrates initial folds arising sulcal pattern governed global shape lateral ventricle
