unraveling dynamical properties grns will key understanding their functionality
throughout development cells progress through succession differentiation steps stem cells via immature progenitors fully differentiated mature cells each subtypes associated unique regulatory state grn
therefore essential understand dynamical properties various regulatory states grns transitions between them their interplay intercellular signaling
unlikely goal achieved solely using experimental approaches
however development dynamical models grns offers great potential interpret existing experimental data order gain new mechanistic insights
various computational approaches been used regulatory network analysis past
boolean models provide qualitative information about network behavior existence steady states network robustness most useful large networks when experimental information scarce
however examine dynamical aspects continuous ordinary differential equation models more appropriate
models constructed phenomenological descriptions gene regulation form hill functions based more detailed biophysical mechanisms derived using statistical thermodynamics approach
phenomenological models useful understanding general dynamics network topology
