 
some studies suggest complex arm movements humans monkeys may optimize several objective functions while others claim arm movements satisfy geometric constraints composed elementary components
however ability unify different constraints remained open question
criterion maximally smooth motion satisfied parabolic trajectories having constant equi-affine speed thus comply geometric constraint known two-thirds power law
here empirically test hypothesis parabolic segments provide compact representation spontaneous drawing movements
monkey scribblings performed during period practice were recorded
practiced hand paths could approximated well relatively long parabolic segments
following practice orientations spatial locations fitted parabolic segments could drawn only 2 4 clusters there was less discrepancy between fitted parabolic segments executed paths
enabled us show well-practiced spontaneous scribbling movements represented sequences small number elementary parabolic primitives
movement primitive defined movement entity cannot intentionally stopped before its completion
found well-trained monkey movement was usually decelerated after receiving reward but stopped only after completion sequence composed several parabolic segments
piece-wise parabolic segments generated applying affine geometric transformations single parabolic template
thus complex movements might constructed applying sequences suitable geometric transformations few templates
our findings therefore suggest motor system aims at achieving more parsimonious internal representations through practice parabolas serve geometric primitives non-euclidean variables employed internal movement representations 
 introduction 
despite decades research formation human hand trajectories basic mechanisms neuromotor control underlying generation even simplest drawing movements remain poorly understood
various studies proposed human movement preparation aims at optimizing either kinematic dynamic criteria minimizing movement variance
studies vertebrates suggested voluntary movements composed basic movement elements combined parallel sequentially
modular organization account versatility animal human movements their ability acquire new skills
geometrically invariant properties drawing movements were formalized two-thirds power law
kinematic constraints were shown hold both respect movement production perception
earlier studies also showed two-thirds power law equivalent moving at constant equi-affine speed there psychophysical neurophysiological evidence significant role invariance human motion respect equi-affine transformations
argue geometric invariance may provide more compact representation complex movements composed geometric primitives
straight point-to-point movements show geometric invariance under dynamic perturbations involving use either elastic viscous loads
point-to-point movements retain invariance their geometric properties even when subjects required control movements cursor computer screen moving their fingers instrumented data glove
recent studies monkeys humans indicated repeatable geometric shapes used construction complex trajectories emerge after extensive practice generation drawing sequential movements
ability unify different kinds movement constraints modeling human animal movements could lead further insights
parabolic movement primitives meet demands geometric invariance kinematic optimality movements simplicity movement representation may subserve underlying building blocks arm trajectory formation
here hypothesis parabolic segments geometric primitives practiced movements was experimentally tested using spontaneous scribbling movements made two monkeys
our choice source data was motivated feasibility subsequently analyzing underlying activity motor cortical neurons 
predictions both two-thirds power law constrained minimum-jerk model identical single parabolic stroke
fit recorded trajectories predictions two models was assessed described detail text s1
preliminary version our findings was presented at tenth biennial conference international graphonomics society 2001 at computational motor control workshops at ben-gurion university 2005 2006
