however detailed molecular properties apoe4 interacting peptide unknown although various mechanisms been proposed explain physiological pathological role relationship
here computer simulations been used investigate process interaction n-terminal domain human apoe isoforms
molecular docking combined molecular dynamics simulations been undertaken determine peptide binding sites relative stability binding each apoe isoforms
our results show several apoe isoforms investigated only apoe4 presents misfolded intermediate when bound moreover initial helix used peptide model structure also becomes unstructured due interaction apoe4
structural changes appear related rearrangement salt bridge network apoe4 propose model
seems plausible apoe4 its partially unfolded state incapable performing clearance thereby promoting amyloid forming processes
hence proposed model used identify potential drug binding sites apoe4-a complex where interaction between two molecules inhibited
 introduction 
alzheimer's disease one most common neurodegenerative diseases at present time
disease characterized formation neurofibrillary tangles plaques brain leading neuronal dysfunction neuronal loss finally death
main component plaques amyloid peptide 39 43 amino acids long hydrophobic peptide generated cleavage amyloid precursor accumulates form soluble non-soluble aggregates
connection between apolipoprotein e ad well established
structurally apoe 299 residues protein n-terminal domain involved binding heparin low density lipoprotein receptors ldlr-related proteins
c-terminal domain been related heparin lipid binding
three main isoforms been described human apoe i.e apoe2 apoe3 apoe4
standard variant apoe3 while apoe2 defective receptor binding causing apoe 2/ 2 homozygotic individuals higher predisposition diseases related high amounts cholesterol triglycerides
apoe4 receptor binding affinity remains unaffected but apoe 4/ 4 homozygotic individuals higher risk coronary heart disease significantly greater risk developing ad
around 80 percent all ad cases related genetic variance at apoe locus 
only difference between apoe isoforms found residues 112 158 where cys112/cys158 corresponds apoe2 cys112/arg158 apoe3 arg112/arg158 apoe4
presence cysteines at positions confers oligomerization properties apoe
indeed apoe2 apoe3 able form disulfide-linked homo hetero-oligomers due presence respectively two one cys residue
apoe4 lacks possibility strong disulfide linking; however unclear whether weaker interactions could promote oligomerization apoe4
cys/arg substitution apoe4 also molecular impact terms intra-protein polar contacts: orientation arg61 different apoe4 compared apoe3; orientation arg61 towards c-terminal domain facilitates salt bridge between arg61 glu255
electrostatic interaction between arg61 glu255 promotes n c-domain interaction packs structure tighter seems crucial interaction apoe4 triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
interaction between arg61 glu255 absent apoe3 leading more open structure preferential binding phospholipid-rich high-density lipoproteins
chemical thermal denaturation experiments shown most unstable structure belongs apoe4 displays partially unfolded intermediate containing some structure may related fact apoe4 enhances deposition 
although different mechanisms been proposed explain physiological pathological relationship between apoe peptide details interaction between apoe at molecular level unknown
detailed knowledge however important understanding pathological mechanisms ad may also help identify potential therapeutic target sites where interaction between apoe4 blocked
present study using molecular docking simulations based global minimum energy investigate interaction process n-terminal domain different apoe isoforms order determine potential peptide binding sites apoe
next step molecular dynamics calculations undertaken explore conformational dynamics apoe under interaction evaluate stability each apoe-a complexes
analysis statistics electrostatic interactions three apoe isoforms present model explaining role apoe interaction its relevance ad
