g-protein coupled receptors highly sophisticated signal transduction machines able respond extracellular stimulus activating diverse intracellular signaling pathways
recent research field unveiling complexity mechanisms involved far being understood detail
among mechanisms allosteric modulation plays central role fine-tuning signaling
unfortunately experimental study allosteric regulatory processes gpcrs difficult because contemporary techniques unable provide structural information sufficient spatial resolution time scales describing specific atomic-level aspects allosteric interactions
