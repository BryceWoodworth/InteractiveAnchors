 
influenza transmitted through respirable inspirable direct-droplet-spray contact modes
how modes affected features virus strain host population environment only recently come under investigation
discrete-event continuous-time stochastic transmission model was constructed analyze environmental processes through virus passes one person another via different transmission modes explore factors increase decrease different modes transmission
exception inspiratory route each route its own cause high transmission isolation other modes
mode-specific transmission was highly sensitive parameter values
example droplet respirable transmission usually required high host density while contact route had no requirement
depending specific context one more modes may sufficient cause high transmission while other contexts no transmission may result
because when making intervention decisions involve blocking environmental pathways generic recommendations applied indiscriminately may ineffective; instead intervention choice should contextualized depending specific features people virus strain venue question
 introduction 
june 11 2009 who declared h1n1 influenza virus pandemic
health organizations worldwide were prompted escalate their efforts minimize transmission within their jurisdictions
airports began monitor incoming passengers while schools increased their already intensive surveillance activities
recommendations were established regard masks hygiene decontamination isolation suspected cases
interest intervention control person-to-person transmitted illnesses multiple potential routes transmission began intensify during emergence sars later h5n1 virus
heightened awareness potential another pandemic influenza led increased funding study non-pharmaceutical interventions cdc well increased efforts modeling influenza transmission
studies were funded order better understand optimal intervention control strategies
much insight was gained into influenza mitigation strategies border closure social distancing antiviral prophylaxis restriction public transportation school closure
date however little known about relative contributions different influenza transmission modes how might vary due heterogeneity viral strain host environment
manuscript explores potential effects unknown factors presenting: transmission model structure explicitly describes environmental processes through viruses pass one person another thereby distinguishing different modes transmission; analytical approach explores factors increase decrease different modes transmission under given model structure
model analyzed environmental infection transmission system model elaborates approach models li et al formulating model discrete event framework greatly expanding details various processes involved
does not define contact events transmission probabilities each event most transmission models do
problem approach defining what constitutes contact
instead define events related virus excretion environmental survival uptake causation infection
allows us address events at level more relevant possible interventions construction more meaningful causal theory
inform relevant intervention options influenza consider four potential modes transmission: respirable inspirable direct-droplet-spray contact mediated transmission
manuscript consider each mode follows
respirable transmission occurs when viruses small particles inhaled deposit alveolar region lower respiratory tract
inspirable transmission occurs when viruses medium size particles inhaled deposit upper respiratory tract
direct-droplet-spray transmission occurs when viruses large particles cough sneeze infected individual deposit directly susceptible individual's mucous membranes
contact transmission occurs when infected person contaminates their own hands contaminates surfaces via their hands via droplets virus laden large particles
transfer pathogens may then result contamination hands others who then may touch their eyes nose mouth self-inoculate potentially infecting upper respiratory tract
assess how different feasible model parameters influence how much transmission follows different routes
example different viruses may different infectivity survivability transferability shedding profiles
similarly among different populations who different behaviors susceptibility profiles shedding profiles same virus may different effects depending type population present
finally even identical viral strains human populations environmental venues may variable host densities surface area volume ratios host movement patterns generate different population level infection outcomes
diverse sources heterogeneity address form corners epidemiologic triad 
assess effects sources heterogeneity relative magnitude influenza transmission modes scenario where all individuals move randomly identical fashion
construct detailed stochastic individual based model environmental influenza transmission
use values empirical literature well expert judgment parameterize model
apply upper lower parameter constraints 18 parameters obtain latin hypercube sample constrained parameter space
analyze resulting outcome space respect how different transmission modes more less important specific contexts
work contribute body literature discussing dominant mode influenza transmission
additionally work takes incremental step forward previous environmental infection transmission models as: model all four modes influenza transmission simultaneously; do so agent based framework rather than ordinary differential equation based framework; model solely informed parametrically empirical work no model fitting optimization procedures were used parameterize model
explicitly point out where holes empirical literature exist
show depending scenario one mode may more less important than another
therefore when intervening generic recommendations applied indiscriminately may ineffective; instead intervention choice should contextualized depending specific features people virus venue question
consider how features related pathology behavior microbiology host pathogen environment alter magnitude transmission via each mode
