 
retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify genes involved tumor development mice yielded substantial number retroviral integration sites number expected grow substantially due introduction high-throughput screening techniques
data various retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens compiled publicly available retroviral tagged cancer gene database
integrally analyzing screens presence common insertion sites requires approach corrects increased probability finding false ciss amount available data increases
moreover significance estimates ciss should established taking into account both noise arising random nature insertion process well bias stemming preferential insertion sites present genome data retrieval methodology
introduce framework kernel convolution framework find ciss noisy biased environment using predefined significance level while controlling family-wise error
where previous methods use one two three predetermined fixed scales our method capable operating at any biologically relevant scale
creates possibility analyze ciss scale space varying width ciss providing new insights behavior ciss across multiple scales
our method also features possibility including models background bias
using simulated data evaluate kc framework using three kernel functions gaussian triangular rectangular kernel function
applied gaussian kc data combined set screens rtcgd found 53 percent ciss do not reach significance threshold combined setting
still fwe under control application our method resulted discovery eight novel ciss each probability less than 5 percent being false detections
 introduction 
retroviral insertional mutagenesis experiments genes involved development cancer identified determining loci viral insertions tumors induced retroviruses mice
after infecting host cell retrovirus inserts its own dna into host cell's genome mutating host cell's dna process
mutation may alter expression genes vicinity insertion when inserted within gene alter gene product
when affected gene cancer gene activation proto-oncogene inactivation tumor-suppressor gene cause uncontrolled proliferation cells
eventually may give rise tumors
throughout text cancer-causing insertions referred oncogenic insertions
tumor develops when accumulation oncogenic insertions causes uncontrolled proliferation cell
result tumor tissue contains many copies cell bearing oncogenic insertions induced proliferation but only few copies cells carrying non-oncogenic insertions
consequently when dna tumor analyzed one will encounter insertion induced proliferation larger proportions than insertions do not
regions genome found carry insertions multiple independent tumors called common insertion sites
result locations ciss highly correlated location genes involved tumor development
cloning flanking sequences inserted virus determine insertion loci analyzing data find significant ciss therefore enable discovery new candidate cancer genes
