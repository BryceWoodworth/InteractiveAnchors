mapping links between environmental growth conditions through signaling networks ultimately resulting transcriptional response primary interest study cellular systems
consequently reconstructions trns model organisms underway 
effectively describe interconnected functions regulated genes associated regulatory proteins within given trn recently developed formalism involving regulatory network matrix called r
r matrix represents components reactions within transcriptional regulatory system
illustrated how using fundamental properties linear algebra matrix formalism allows characterization trs properties facilitates silico prediction transcription state genome under any specified set environmental conditions
importantly previously reported r matrix distinct existing approaches use matrix formalisms matrix algebra analyze gene expression data describes relationships governing gene transcription derived experiments characterizing how specific inputs regulate expression individual genes
