 introduction 
hsp70 molecular chaperones part quality control machinery functions assist protein folding
members hsp70 family been implicated refolding misfolded proteins folding newly synthesized polypeptide chains disassembly larger aggregates translocation proteins organelles
hsp70 molecules also enable cell survival during stress heat-shock conditions characterized increased concentration denatured polypeptides
chaperones recognize bind misfolded aggregation-prone peptide stretches through exposed hydrophobic regions normally buried protein core
exposed regions typical non-native proteins 
hsp70 molecular chaperones consist two distinct domains n-terminal atpase domain c-terminal peptide binding domain
hsp70 function dependent atp-regulated cycle substrate binding release
atp bound substrate affinity low hsp70 resides open state ready receive suitable substrate
once substrate bound atp hydrolyzed adp hsp70 undergoes conformational change high affinity state subsequently trapping substrate
co-chaperone hsp40 binds hsp70 stimulates atpase function causing retention substrate
hsp40 also recognizes hydrophobic stretches may serve substrate delivery chaperone hsp70
upon exchange adp atp hsp70 returns low affinity state enabling binding another substrate providing another refolding cycle same substrate if necessary
crystallisation archetypical well characterized e coli hsp70 dnak bound peptide reflects heptameric substrate binding motif requiring hydrophobic core region preferably basic flanking residues complement overall negatively charged dnak surface
preference was later confirmed seminal work bukau co-workers binding studies dnak cellulose-based peptide libraries dnak binding profile was derived 
contrary previous studies dnak binding motif profiling utilised only sequence information complement experimental binding information set peptides structural data homology modelling obtain accurate predictor
similar dual based approaches already been shown successful predict other peptide signatures
prediction binding endogenous antigenic peptides mhc class i molecules was aided adding structural information molecular models sequence data
branetti et al used structural data various sh3/ligand complexes sequence information phage libraries predict preferred ligand binding different sh3 domains
recently algorithm predict amylogenic regions protein sequences profited greatly combination sequence based data structural information amyloid fibers crystallographic studies 
article introduce dual based method profiling dnak binding sequences
combine sequence based information experimental binding assays structural information molecular modelling via foldx force field
present dnak binding prediction algorithm under cross-validated conditions performs strikingly accurate
