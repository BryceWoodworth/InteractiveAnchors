 
knowledge social contact patterns still represents most critical step understanding spread directly transmitted infections
data social contact patterns however expensive obtain
major issue then whether simulation synthetic societies might helpful reliably reconstruct data
paper compute variety synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation simple individual-based model
model informed italian time use data routine socio-demographic data
model named little italy because each artificial agent clone real person
other words each agent's daily diary one observed corresponding real individual sampled italian time use survey
also generated contact matrices socio-demographic model underlying italian ibm pandemic prediction
synthetic matrices then validated against recently collected italian serological data varicella parvovirus
their performance fitting sero-profiles compared other matrices available italy polymod matrix
synthetic matrices show same qualitative features ones estimated sample surveys: example strong assortativeness presence super sub-diagonal stripes related contacts between parents children
once validated against serological data little italy matrices fit worse than polymod one vzv but better than concurrent matrices b19
first occasion where synthetic contact matrices systematically compared real ones validated against epidemiological data
results suggest simple carefully designed synthetic matrices provide fruitful complementary approach questionnaire-based matrices
paper also supports idea depending transmissibility level infection either number different contacts repeated exposure may key factor transmission
 introduction 
century after first contributions giving birth mathematical epidemiology after 20 years fast growth since first public health oriented contributions infectious diseases modeling recently received further dramatic impulse pandemics threats
bio-terrorism sars first fear potentially devastating pandemic avian flu then finally recent pandemic a/h1n1 influenza all fostered development more more detailed predictive tools
range traditional models network analysis highly detailed large scale individual-based models
ibm highly flexible tools policy makers they allow define intervention measures at finest possible levels
first time pandemic model continental scale been proposed 
critical aspect common all models parameterization social contact patterns i.e how people socially mix each other
social contact patterns key factors underlying transmission dynamics directly transmitted close-contacts infectious diseases
different models independently their level complexity geographical scale sensitive parameterization social contact patterns
relatively simple case where individuals stratified age only contact patterns represented form contact matrices whose entries represent average number contacts individuals age group i individuals age group j per unit time
until recently contact patterns were estimated indirectly calibrating suitably restricted contact matrices using observed epidemiological data serological case notifications data
two major examples indirect approach who-acquires-infection-from-whom matrix proportionate/preferred mixing approach
approaches important restrictions: population divided n age groups contact matrix contains nxn n 2 unknown entries
therefore order estimate n 2 parameters n data points some simplifying assumptions about structure matrix needed
addition indirect approaches only estimate adequate contacts transmission rates i.e composite parameters given product between contact rate corresponding risk infection per contact
recently important progress been made area through direct collection contact data means sample surveys
direct approach based appropriate definitions at risk event
survey respondents then asked record diary relevant characteristics all individuals they had contact during randomly assigned day other factors location where contact occurred
standardized international survey data social contact patterns 8 european countries currently available
addition contact matrices time contact matrices been estimated secondary data sources transportation surveys time use data increasingly available
case time use data underlying hypothesis amount time people spend doing same activity same place relevant transmission disease
drawback time use data they usually do not give direct information about number social contacts respondents time they spent contacts
they only give marginal information time individuals allocated various daily activities
therefore data need augmented other data and/or assumptions produce reliable estimates contact matrices
way supplement time use data relies socio-demographic sources provide information size distribution arenas where contacts take place
example school contacts often know average class size average pupils-teacher ratio all compulsory grades
contacts within household information household size composition
most other activities however there little information
assumptions e.g independency therefore necessary give some coarse ideas contact patterns
however approach ignores structure social networks where contacts formed
promising approach then reconstruct networks simulation appropriate artificial social networks
first example social network generated portland synthetic population
case contact time contact matrices age by-products social dynamics portland model
matrices standard expected features: population contacts cluster around children adult children interact most frequently other children close their own age etc however matrices were neither compared other contact matrices nor validated against empirical epidemiological data
thus no actual evaluation their goodness explaining transmission infections available
paper follow same line aim reconstruct contact time-in-contacts matrices simulating suitable minimalistic socio-demographic individual-based model italy
model parameterized integrating time use data italian time use survey other official socio-demographic data
model each artificial agent clone real individual i.e there one-to-one correspondence between diary each artificial agent one corresponding real survey participant
since sample representative italian population but size model population comparable small italian city named model little italy
point view our model resembles portland model eemnes model
little italy world agents physically displace during day order attend their various daily activities corresponding location
locations agents contact other agents
defined contact having shared same physical environment during given time slot
our approach generate three different types contact matrices possibly informative distinct aspects biology transmission: matrix describing time spent contact matrix counting number repetition contact episodes matrix counting contacts average number different persons contacted i.e number different social partnerships 
addition extracted adequate contact matrix socio-demographic model underlying italian ibm pandemic prediction mitigation named big-italy
synthetic contact matrices computed simulation little big-italy tested against recently collected italian serological data varicella parvovirus
their performances compared other contact matrices available italy i.e polymod time use matrices
