 introduction 
serotonin neuromodulator appears play critical role wealth psychiatric conditions including depression anxiety panic obsessive compulsions
however despite importance serotonergic pharmacotherapies notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors roles serotonin plays normal abnormal function still mysterious
start three particular findings
first 5-ht involved prediction aversive events possibly form opponent dopamine
second 5-ht involved behavioral inhibition preventing curtailing ongoing actions light predictions aversive outcomes
third finding collection psychopharmacological data implicating 5-ht animal models depression anxiety together fact depleting 5-ht human subjects who recovered depression reinstate acute at times fulminant re-experience subjective symptoms disease assessed various rating scales
furthermore while ssris used treatment depression genetically induced constitutive decreases efficiency 5-ht reuptake risk factor depression
findings hard connect: second fact seems orthogonal first third themselves apparent contradiction
if 5-ht really involved predicting aversive outcomes then depleting should surely positive rather than negative affective consequences
suggest missing link comes considering interactions between pavlovian predictions ongoing action selection
interaction seen conditioned suppression standard workhorse test aversive predictions
animals trained emit appetitive instrumental actions associate light shock
presentation light during instrumental performance reduces rate at animals emit those responses
neither theoretical nor neurobiological status interaction completely resolved though there some evidence involvement 5-ht nucleus accumbens its realization 
here treat subset inhibitory processes associated gray's behavioral inhibition system terms what might called preparatory pavlovian response
consummatory pavlovian responses pre-programmed reactions presence affectively significant outcomes food water threats
preparatory pavlovian responses similarly pre-programmed responses predictions those outcomes
even though predictions learned responses not may therefore behaviorally inappropriate certain circumstances
our purposes long noted deakin graeff most important preparatory pavlovian response prediction threat inhibition form withdrawal disengagement
explicitly links first two findings discussed above inhibition directly associated aversive predictions
explore consequences reflexive direct inhibition action learning affective settings together repercussions when 5-ht compromised built highly simplified model sought isolate effects more general learning effects
more specifically built model trains thoughts
our treatment considered thoughts actions lead one belief state next
trains thought gained value through their connections group terminal states were preassigned either positive negative affective values
5-ht directly inhibited chains thought predicted lead toward negative terminal states
our model seen terms 5-ht's pruning decision tree outcome states choices 
argue results tryptophan depletion above now emerge when considering consequences reflexive behavioral inhibition ongoing learning about world subsequent action choice predictions
most notable effect model critical bias toward optimistic valuation
states actions potentially negative consequences under-explored incorrectly valued because reflexive inhibition
when inhibition fails though last three issues mentioned above there two adverse consequences
first inhibition no longer crutch instrumental action choice so subjects learn avoid potentially bad situations rather than being able rely reflexive mechanism
second due mismatch between policy value function characteristic inconsistencies between predicted actual values arise actual values encountered being more negative than predicted though also actually more realistic
mismatch between policy value function also leads overall reduction rewards obtained
boosting 5-ht model again restores status quo
course highly simplified model cannot possibly itself accommodate all diverse confusing roles 5-ht
nevertheless replicates some prominent behavioral pharmacological facets depression anxiety humans animal models return discussion
next section defines model trains thought more formally
results section considers normal learning consequences impairments 5-ht processing
save discussion broader discussion data theories pertaining 5-ht
