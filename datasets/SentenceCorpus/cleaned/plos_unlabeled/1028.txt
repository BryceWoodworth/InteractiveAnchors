 introduction 
labeling set fixed data another representative set generic description large family problems
family includes clustering dimensionality reduction approach original dataset represented set typically far lower dimension
representative set often parameter vector signifies set data points simply cluster mean may include additional parameters cluster diameter
labeling problem important because encountered many applications involving data analysis particularly where prior knowledge probability distributions incomplete lacking
challenging instance labeling problem arises naturally nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy along x-ray crystallography one two major methods determining protein structures
although nmr spectroscopy not highly automated more mature x-ray field advantages over x-ray crystallography structural studies small proteins partially disordered exist multiple stable conformations solution exhibit weak interactions ligands fail crystallize readily provided nmr signals assigned specific atoms covalent structure protein
labeling problem known assignment problem been one major bottlenecks protein nmr spectroscopy
protein nmr structure determination generally proceeds through series steps
usual approach first collect data used determining backbone aliphatic side chain assignments
assignments then used interpret data collected order determine interatomic torsion angular constraints used structure determination
front-end labeling process associates one more nmr parameters physical entity ; back-end labeling process associates nmr parameters constraints define refine conformational states
reality distinction between front-end back-end artificial
strategies been developed use noesy data assignments direct structure determination without assignments
addition demonstrated recently structures small proteins determined directly assigned chemical shifts process largely bypasses back-end
ideally all available data should used unified process yields best set assignments best structure consistent experiment probabilistic analysis provides levels confidence assignments atomic coordinates
usual approach solution problem assigning labels subsets peaks assembled multiple sets noisy spectra collect number multidimensional multinuclear datasets
after converting time domain data frequency domain spectra fourier transformation peaks picked each spectrum analysis
methods been developed automated peak picking global analysis spectra yield models consisting peaks known intensity frequency phase decay rate linewidth
ideal case resulting peak-lists identify combinatorial subsets two more covalently bonded nuclei their respective frequencies
subsets must assembled coherent way best correspond specific atoms amino acid sequence protein
practice peak lists do not report all nuclei noise peaks commonplace
examples analyzed here level missing peaks varied between 9 percent 38 percent while level noise peaks varied between 10 percent 135 percent
large number false positives well false negatives typically present data result explosion ambiguities during assembly subsets
common feature among prior approaches been divide assignment labels into sequence discrete steps apply varying methods at each step
steps typically include assignment step secondary structure determination step validation step
validation step discrete reliability measure indicates possible presence outliers misassignments abnormal backbone chemical shift values sometimes omitted
other steps added steps split further into simpler tasks
example backbone side chain assignments frequently carried out sequentially separate processes
some approaches sequence-specific assignment rely substantially reduced combinatorial set input data assuming prior subset selection e.g prior spin system assembly
specification conformational states added yet another labeling step
example backbone dihedral angles specified grid determined chemical shifts coupling constants and/or noes reduced dipolar couplings 
nmr assignment problem been highly researched most naturally formulated combinatorial optimization problem subsequently solved using variety algorithms

most established judged bmrb entries cite assignment software packages used autoassign garant 
similarly wide range methods been used predict protein secondary structural elements play important role classifying proteins
prior approaches assigning secondary structure label each residue protein included method chemical shift index method database approach empirical probability-based method supervised machine learning approach probabilistic approach utilizes local statistical potential combine predictive potentials derived sequence chemical shifts
recently fully automated approach protein structure determination flya been described pipelines standard steps nmr spectra structure utilizes garant assignment engine
flya approach demonstrates benefits making use information each step iterative fashion achieve high number backbone side chain assignments
our goal implement comprehensive approach utilizes network model rather than pipeline model relies probabilistic analysis results
reformulate combinatorial optimization problem whereby each labeling configuration ensemble associated but unknown non-vanishing probability
pine algorithm enables full integration information disparate steps achieve probabilistic analysis
use probabilities provides means sharing refining incomplete information among current standard steps steps introduced future developments
addition probabilistic analysis deals directly multiple minima problem arises cases where data does not support single optimal self-consistent state
common example protein populates two stable conformational states
pine-nmr package described here represents first step approaching goal full probabilistic approach protein nmr spectroscopy
pine-nmr accepts input sequence protein plus peak lists derived one more nmr experiments chosen user extensive list possibilities
pine-nmr provides output probabilistic assignment backbone aliphatic side chain chemical shifts secondary structure protein
at same time identifies verifies if needed rectifies problems related chemical shift referencing consistency assignments determined secondary structure
pine-nmr make use prior information derived independently other means selective labeling patterns spin system assignments
principle networked model pine-nmr extensible both directions within pipeline protein structure determination : combined adaptive data collection at front three-dimensional structure determination at back end
extensions should lead rapid fully automated approach nmr structure determination would yield structure most consistent all available data confidence limits atom positions explicitly represented
