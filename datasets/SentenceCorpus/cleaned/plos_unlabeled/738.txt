 introduction 
structure protein determines its function
knowledge structure therefore used guide design drugs improve interpretation other information locations mutations identify remote protein homologs
indirect methods x-ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy required determine tertiary structure protein
membrane proteins essential variety processes including small-molecule transport signaling significant biological interest
however they not easily amenable existing crystallization methods even though some most difficult problems area been overcome recent years number known tertiary structures membrane structures remains very low
computational methods accurately predict basic topology transmembrane proteins easily available information therefore continue great interest
most valuable predicted topology include not only locations membrane-spanning segments but should also correctly localize n c-termini relative membrane
many proteins include short n-terminal signal peptide initially directs post-translational transport protein across membrane subsequently cleaved off after transport
signal peptide includes strongly hydrophobic segment not part mature protein but often misclassified membrane-spanning portion transmembrane protein
conversely transmembrane protein membrane-spanning segment near n-terminus often misclassified having signal peptide
therefore signal peptide prediction transmembrane topology prediction should performed simultaneously rather than being treated two separate tasks
membrane proteins classically divided into two structural classes: those traverse membrane using helical bundle bacteriorhodopsin those use barrel porin
barrel motif found only small fraction all membrane proteins
lately some attention been given some irregular structures re-entrant loops random coil regions
work however focus helical class both because most membrane proteins fall into class because they constitute most known 3d structures
two most common machine learning approaches applied prediction both signal peptides topology transmembrane proteins hidden markov models artificial neural networks while some predictors use combination two approaches
hmms particularly well suited sequence labeling tasks task-specific prior knowledge encoded into structure hmm while anns learn make classification decisions based hundreds inputs
first hmm-based transmembrane protein topology predictors were introduced ten years ago: tmhmm hmmtop
both predictors define set structural classes capture variation amino acid composition different portions membrane protein
example membrane-spanning helix known highly hydrophobic cytoplasmic loops generally contain more positively charged amino acids than non-cytoplasmic loops
during training hmm learns set emission distributions one each structural classes
tmhmm trained using two-pass discriminative training approach followed decoding using one-best algorithm
hmmtop introduced hypothesis difference between amino acid distributions various structural classes main driving force determining final protein topology therefore most likely topology one maximizes difference given protein
hmmtop was also first allow constrained decoding incorporate additional evidence regarding localization one more positions within protein sequence
presence signal peptide within given protein also been successfully predicted using both hmms anns 
mentioned above confusion between signal peptides transmembrane segments one largest sources error both conventional transmembrane topology predictors signal peptide predictors
motivated difficulty hmm phobius was designed combine signal peptide model signalp-hmm transmembrane topology model tmhmm
authors showed including signal peptide sub-model improves overall accuracy detecting differentiating proteins signal peptides proteins transmembrane segments
work introduce philius combined transmembrane topology signal peptide predictor extends phobius exploiting power dynamic bayesian networks
application dbns task provides several advantages specifically: new two-stage decoding procedure new way expressing non-geometric duration distributions new approach expressing label uncertainty during training
philius inspired phobius tackles problem discriminating among four basic types proteins: globular globular signal peptide transmembrane transmembrane signal peptide
philius also predicts location signal peptide cleavage site complete topology membrane proteins
report state-of-the-art results discrimination task improvements over phobius topology prediction task
also introduce set confidence measures at three different levels: at level protein type at level individual topology segment at level full topology
confidence measures topology predictions were introduced mel n et al expand upon work three types scores correlate well observed precision
finally based philius predictions entire yeast resource center protein database provide overview relative percentages different types proteins different organisms well composition class membrane proteins
transmembrane protein topology prediction stated supervised learning problem over amino acid sequences
training set consists pairs sequences form where o o 1 o n sequence amino acids protein known topology s s 1 s n corresponding sequence labels
o i drawn alphabet 20 amino acids formula s i drawn alphabet topology labels formula corresponding respectively cytoplasmic loops membrane-spanning segments non-cytoplasmic loops signal peptides
after training learned model parameters takes input single amino acid test sequence o seeks predict best corresponding label sequence s
