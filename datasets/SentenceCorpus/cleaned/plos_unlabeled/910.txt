 introduction 
target-based drug discovery predominant focus pharmaceutical industry
primary objective selectively target protein within diseased cells order ameliorate undesired phenotype e.g unrestrained cell proliferation inflammatory cytokine release
ideally other pathways within diseased cells well similar phenotypes other cell types should remain unaffected therapeutic approach
however despite plethora new potential targets emerged sequencing human genome rather few proven effective clinic
major limitation inability understand mechanisms drug actions either due complex signaling transduction networks cells due complicated profile drug potency selectivity
finding drug's targets traditionally based high-throughput vitro assays using recombinant enzymes protein fragments
main goal characterize drug's biochemical activity depict them drug-interaction maps
most cases once target known vivo effect signaling pathway validated measuring drug's efficiency inhibit activity downstream protein
however beyond measurement little know how rest signaling network affected
addition vivo drug effects hardly calculated vitro assays several reasons: most kinase inhibitors promiscuous there discrepancy between vivo vitro binding affinities drugs there additional discrepancy between vivo binding affinities vivo inhibitor activity phosphorylation downstream signals
address drug effects more physiological conditions novel genomic proteomic tools recently been developed
genomic arena large-scale mrna analysis enhanced computational approaches drug target deconvolution been developed
despite holistic advantages genomic approaches offer proteomic-based discovery step closer function cell
towards goal affinity chromatography offers viable strategy in-vivo target identification
approach utilizes solid support linked bait enrich cellular binding proteins identified mass spectrometry
however experiments usually require large amounts starting protein biased toward more abundant proteins result several hits due nonspecific interactions
order circumvent non-specific interaction problem another bait-based strategy uses quantitative ms dirty inhibitors baits immobilize kinome
while approach significantly reduces non-specific interaction problem also limits target-searching space those kinases highest affinity bait
more recently quantitative ms-based proteomics using silac technology extends search space all targets do not bind covalently drug
however incorporation silac's isotopes requires 5 population doublings thus excludes application primary cells limited replication capabilities
taken together all techniques listed above best case scenario list affinities all targets drug but no information provided whether binding affinity capable inhibiting transmission signal downstream protein how those preferential bindings collectively affect signaling network cell
here describe significantly different approach identify drug effects where drugs evaluated alterations they cause signaling pathways
instead identifying binding partners monitor pathway alterations following key phosphorylation events under several treatments cytokines
workflow presented figure 1
experimental front using bead-based multiplexed assays measure 13 key phosphorylation events under more than 50 different conditions generated combinatorial treatment stimuli selective inhibitors
based signaling response a-priori set possible reactions create cell-type specific pathway using efficient optimization formulation known integer linear programming
approach builds upon boolean optimization approach proposed
ilp solved using standard commercial software packages guaranteed global optimality
evaluate drug effects subject cells same stimuli presence drugs tract alterations same key phosphorylation events
then reapply ilp formulation without a-priori assumption drug target monitor changes pathway topology without drug presence
demonstrate our approach construct generic map optimize fit phosphoproteomic data transformed hepatocytic cell lines hepg2
then identify effects four drugs: dual egfr/erbb-2 inhibitor lapatinib two potent egfr kinase inhibitors erlotinib gefitinib dirty raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib
when our method applied those 4 drugs find their main target effect also uncover several unknown but equally active off-target effects
case gefitinib find surprising inhibition cjun il1 pathway
contrast previously developed techniques our method based actual effect phosphorylation events carefully spread into signaling network
theoretically applied any type intracellular perturbations atp-based allosteric kinase inhibitors rnai shrna etc computational front our ilp-based approach performs faster more efficient than current algorithms pathway optimization identify main drug effects well unknown off-target effects areas pathways constrained between activated receptors measured phosphorylated proteins
our fast unbiased characterization modes drug actions shed light into potential mechanisms drug's efficacy toxicity
