 introduction 
tuberculosis caused bacterial pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis leading cause mortality among infectious diseases
been estimated world health organization almost one-third world's population around 2 billion people infected disease
every year more than 8 million people develop active form disease subsequently claims lives nearly 2 million
translates over 4,900 deaths per day more than 95 percent developing countries
2002 who estimated if worldwide spread tuberculosis was left unchecked then disease would responsible approximately 36 million more deaths year 2020
despite current global situation anti-tubercular drugs remained largely unchanged over last four decades
widespread use agents time needed remove infection promoted emergence resistant m.tuberculosis strains
multi-drug resistant tuberculosis defined resistance first-line drugs isoniazid rifampin
effective treatment mdr-tb necessitates long-term use second-line drug combinations unfortunate consequence emergence extensively drug resistant tuberculosis m.tuberculosis strains resistant isoniazid plus rifampin well key second-line drugs ciprofloxacin moxifloxacin
xdr-tb extremely difficult treat because only remaining drug classes exhibit very low potency high toxicity
rise xdr-tb around world including industrialized nations imposes great threat human health therefore emphasizing need identify new anti-tubercular agents urgent priority 
currently anti-infective therapeutics discovered developed either de novo strategies through extension available chemical compounds target protein families same similar structures functions
de novo drug discovery involves use high throughput screening techniques identify new compounds both synthetic natural novel drugs
unfortunately approach yielded very few successes field anti-infective drug discovery
indeed progression early-stage biochemical hits robust lead compounds commonly unfruitful process
identification both molecular targets essential survival pathogen compounds active intact cells challenging task
even more formidable however requirement appropriate potency levels suitable pharmacokinetics order achieve efficacy small animal disease models
challenges reflected high costs involved bringing new drugs market
fact been estimated successful launch single new drug costs more than us 800 million 
two alternative drug discovery strategies circumvent some challenges associated de novo drug discovery label extension piggy-back strategies both widely employed discovery novel therapeutics treat tropical diseases
label extension fast-track approach involves extension indications existing treatment another disease
some most important anti-parasitic drugs use today praziquantel schistosomiasis were derived label extension process
major advantages label extension significant reductions cost time market achieved
alternatively when molecular target present pathogen under investigation other commercial indications possible adopt piggy-back strategy utilizing identified chemical starting points
examples approach include anti-malarial screening lead series cysteine protease inhibitors treatment osteoporosis histone deacetylase inhibitors use cancer chemotherapy 
one main aims drug discovery develop safe effective therapeutic agents through optimization binding specific protein target
way undesirable effects resulting side scatter pharmacology minimized
however recent rapid completion numerous genome sequencing projects revealed proteins involved entirely different biochemical pathways even residing different tissues organs may possess functional binding pockets similar shapes physiochemical properties
therefore chemical matter one target could considered basis leads entirely different target
recent work large scale mapping polypharmacology interactions paolini et al revealed extent promiscuity drugs leads across proteome
they discovered around 35 percent 276,122 active compounds their database had observed activity more than one target
whilst majority promiscuous compounds were found active against targets within same gene family significant number had recorded activity across different gene families
finding so many drugs interact more than one target provided rationale behind selective optimization side activities approach recently developed wermuth
sosa approach involves use old drugs new pharmacological targets valuable concept considering finite number small molecules safely administered humans
process itself involves screening limited number structurally diverse drug molecules then optimizing hits so they show stronger affinity new target weaker affinity original target
way possible derive whole panel new active molecules single marketed drug
since screened drug molecules already known safety bioavailability humans overall time cost drug discovery significantly reduced when compared de novo strategies
developed novel computational strategy identify off-targets major pharmaceuticals proteome-wide scale
our methodology extends scope sosa concept effectively systematically across gene families more likely successful achieving ultimate goal providing new drugs old ones
our chemical systems biology approach proceeds follows:
binding site commercially available drug extracted predicted 3d structure model target protein 
off-targets similar ligand binding sites identified across proteome using efficient accurate functional site search algorithm 
atomic interactions between putative off-targets drug evaluated using protein-ligand docking
only those off-targets do not experience serious atomic clashes drug selected further analysis
drug further optimized enhance its potency selectivity adme properties taking into account both primary target off-targets across genome
our approach essentially explores complex protein-ligand interaction networks proteome-wide scale
lead compound discovered all drug targets across different gene families
moreover lead optimization focus compounds excellent safety profiles known clinical outcomes
way our approach potential increase rate successful drug discovery development whilst reducing costs involved
present study demonstrate efficiency efficacy our chemical systems biology approach through discovery safe chemical compounds potential treat mdr-tb xdr-tb
identified compounds entacapone tolcapone
drugs primarily target human catechol-o-methyltransferase involved breakdown catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine
they used adjuncts treat parkinson's disease increasing bioavailability primary drug levodopa substrate comt
entacapone tolcapone predicted inhibit m.tuberculosis enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase essential type ii fatty acid biosynthesis subsequent synthesis bacterial cell wall
inha target anti-tubercular drugs isoniazid ethionamide
similar newly developed direct inha inhibitors entacapone tolcapone require no enzymatic activation bind inha
thus they may avoid commonly observed resistance mechanism isoniazid ethionamide exhibited many mdr strains
our computational predictions been partially validated demonstrating entacapone drug tablet comtan inhibits growth m.tuberculosis at minimal inhibition concentration entacapone 260.0 m well below concentration leading neuroblastoma cellular toxicity
direct inhibition inha entacapone further confirmed experimental enzyme kinetic assays comtan shown reduce inha activity up 47 percent at effective entacapone concentration 80 m since entacapone excellent safety profile few side effects shows potential drug lead development new class anti-tubercular therapeutics favorable adme/tox properties
