binding affinities characterized stochastic shape space model
system loss arising individual infection associated disease severity measured total antigen population over course infection
monitor evolution cell populations shape space over string infections find distribution losses becomes increasingly heavy-tailed time
initially lowers average loss: memory cell population becomes tuned history past exposures reducing loss system when subjected second similar infection
accompanied corresponding increase vulnerability novel infections ultimately causes expected loss increase due overspecialization leading increasing fragility age
our model immunosenescence not result performance degradation some specific lymphocyte but rather natural consequence built-in mechanisms system adaptation
robust yet fragile behavior key signature highly optimized tolerance
 introduction 
adaptive immune system vertebrates evolved manner enables adaptation history infections over lifetime each individual organism
consists complex heterogeneous collection cells derived stem cells bone marrow proliferates lymph nodes
cells endowed remarkable ability discriminate between self nonself agents within body remove nonself elements
b t cells white blood cells constitute adaptive components immune system
they derive their ability discriminate self nonself binding specificity their receptors: t cell receptors t cells membrane-bound antibody b cells
receptors assembled randomly gene segments producing population naive cells each individual combination different binding specificity
random combinations genes give immune system ability produce diverse cells capable responding many pathogens
during infection cells whose receptors recognize antigen proliferate differentiate into antigen-removing effector cells long-lived memory cells
memory cells give rise more rapid efficient response secondary exposure same antigen
however due homeostatic regulation lymphocyte population growth memory cells reduces naive cell population size
over time effect increasing sensitivity novel infections
introduce model captures tradeoff between resilience repeated exposure sensitivity new pathogens
model consists coupled differential equations immune-system cell populations defined terms their primary immunological function their binding characteristics
relative population sizes evolve time stimulated episodic infections
antigens drawn probability distribution their characteristics enables estimation binding affinity lymphocytes
include constraint total number immune cells system define immunological loss function quantifies disease severity
constraint number cells implies memory specific infections system seen comes at price unseen infections
our model illustrates how immune system initially increases effectiveness but eventually becomes overspecialized age
