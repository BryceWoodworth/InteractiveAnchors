fine-tuning achieved through regulation both gene expression protein activity shaped various physiological requirements
requirements impose sustained evolutionary pressure ultimately selects specific gene expression profile generating suitable adaptive response each environmental change
although some requirements stress specific likely others common various situations
hypothesize evolutionary pressure minimizing biosynthetic costs might left signatures physicochemical properties proteins whose gene expression fine-tuned during adaptive responses
test hypothesis analyze existing yeast transcriptomic data responses investigate how several properties proteins correlate changes gene expression
our results reveal signatures consistent selective pressure economy protein synthesis during adaptive response yeast various types stress
signatures differentiate two groups adaptive responses respect how cells manage expenditure protein biosynthesis
one group significant trends towards downregulation large proteins upregulation small ones observed
other group find no trends
results consistent resource limitation being important evolution first group stress responses
 introduction 
unicellular organisms sensitive environmental challenges
their internal milieu acts buffer against changes mounting adaptive response involving modifications at different cellular levels
appropriate adaptive responses require intracellular signaling changes conformation activity proteins changes transcription translation genes etc
many cellular modifications characterize any adaptive response due need acquiring new protein functionalities while shutting down other protein functionalities not required new conditions
changes ultimately fine tune mechanisms processes allow cell function appropriately survive under changing environments
fine tuning shaped various functional requirements physiological constraints
functional requirements result specific demands imposed cell survival environment
other hand physiological constraints defined limits within cell physically capable changing activity its component parts meet functional requirements
global point view adaptive responses seen multi-optimization problem because cells evolved appropriate responses cope different types stress while optimizing different parts its metabolism each those responses
example cells simultaneously increase concentration specific metabolites proteins while decreasing concentration other components prevent increase concentration unneeded metabolites
increase could strain cell solubility capacity increase spurious reactivity dangerous levels
other functional constraints likely provide sustained evolutionary pressures ultimately select specific gene expression profile leads suitable adaptive responses
arguments mind thus important identify functional requirements quantitative physiological constraints may significantly shape adaptive responses
among others minimization energetic expenditure plays important role cells growing exponentially rich medium
several signatures consistent minimization metabolic cost already been identified properties set proteins expressed when cells growing rich media 
example genes coding proteins highly abundant under basal conditions pattern synonymous codon usage well adapted relative abundance synonymous trnas yeast s cerevisiae escherichia coli 
another signature found genes highly expressed under basal conditions sequence bias minimizes transcriptional translational costs
minimization metabolic cost further observed relative amino acid composition abundant proteins under same conditions
proteins enriched metabolically cheaper amino acids 
final example general signature codon bias long genes
bias probability missense errors reduced during translation
biases suggest reducing overall costs metabolism whenever possible may significantly increase cellular fitness
view consistent observation small changes gene expression affecting levels protein synthesis influence fitness specific e coli strains 
body results strongly supports notion metabolic cost acts selective pressure shaping properties cells growing rich medium absence environmental stresses
thus one might ask if minimization metabolic cost also important factor evolution adaptive responses stress conditions
predictable evolutionary pressure might leave stronger signatures adaptive responses require use higher atp amounts cell adaptation heat weak organic acids nacl
three cases been reported atp concentrations decrease due high energy demand 
given protein synthesis one costliest biosynthetic efforts cell minimization metabolic cost might biased properties proteins whose expression change during adaptation
therefore here ask following questions
there signature consistent selective pressure minimizing metabolic cost proteins synthesis during adaptive responses stress
one find general signatures physicochemical properties proteins expression patterns genes involved adaptive response different environmental challenges
if so what physiological constraints consistent those signatures
address questions investigating how value several properties proteins related changes gene expression levels during various environmental changes
find genes whose expression upregulated during different types adaptive responses tend code proteins small while genes whose expression downregulated during same responses tend code proteins large
signature consistent selective pressure minimizing metabolic cost proteins synthesis
more significant adaptive responses where changes gene expression levels affect large fraction genome
our knowledge first general global signature been identified properties proteins involved adaptive responses stress
