 introduction 
information processing associated higher brain functions believed carried out large scale neural networks
significant theoretical computational efforts been devoted over years understand dynamical behavior networks
while any modeling attempt aspires preserve most relevant physical dynamical characteristics networks certain simplifying hypothesis usually employed order decrease overwhelming complexity problem
particular computational models large scale networks make use implicit assumption neurocomputational unit
unit designates population thousands neurons exhibit similar behavior
large scale network then defined units their interconnections
order describe dynamics unit further assumptions employed
instance neurons may regarded identical entities nature strength their connections may neglected temporal details their spiking activity considered irrelevant dynamics large network
consequently small neural network properties will show very well synchronized dynamics easily captured conventional neural mass model 
remarkable amount scientific work been devoted understanding behavior neural networks when some assumptions dismissed
many studies consider either inhomogeneities network connectivity heterogeneous inputs give special attention synchronized state network
among first attempts one may consider studies coupled oscillators kuramoto who introduced order parameter capturing degree synchronization function coupling strength frequency distribution
more generally pecora et al derived master stability equation serving stability condition synchronized state arbitrary network
recently hennig et al derive similar conditions considering connectivity well heterogeneous inputs
another direction describing dynamical behavior networks involves derivation equations synchronized state along equations describing deviations synchrony
approaches suitable only when deviation synchronized state not very strong
other hand there exists another class approaches based mean field theory
traditional mean field approaches incapable addressing synchronized neural activity since their basic assumption incoming spike-train given neuron network poissonian hence uncorrelated
other dynamical behaviors far synchrony multi-clustering phase instance also require expansions current approaches
first attempts do so include consideration higher orders mean field expansion mode decompositions network dynamics phase space
latter approach assisi et al successfully identified network modes characteristic behavior but been limited biologically unrealistic situations purely excitatory inhibitory networks simplistic neuron models
while true strong reductionist assumptions common large-scale network modeling assumptions network node's dynamics usually made adhoc limit network dynamics small range
evidently reduced small scale network model desirable serve node large scale network simulation whereby displaying sufficiently rich dynamic repertoire
here less importance find quantitatively precise reduced description neural population; rather more importantly seek computationally inexpensive population model able display major qualitative dynamic behaviors realistic parameter ranges observed total population neurons
here also desirable include biologically more realistic neuron dynamics bursting behavior since novel phenomena small scale network level may occur need captured reduced population model
paper extend approach assisi et al towards biologically more realistic network architectures including mixed excitatory inhibitory networks well more realistic neuron models capable displaying spiking bursting behavior
our reduced neural population models not only account correct reproduction mean field amplitude original networks but also capture most important temporal features its dynamics
way complex dynamical phenomena multi-clustered oscillations multi-time scale synchronization oscillation death become available simulations large scale neural networks at low computational cost
start investigating first main features dynamic behavior globally coupled heterogeneous neural population comprising both excitatory inhibitory connections
then using mode decomposition techniques derive analytically low dimensional representation network dynamics show main features neural population's collective behavior captured well dynamics few modes
