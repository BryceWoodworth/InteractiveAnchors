disambiguate sensory information into estimates scene properties our brains incorporate prior knowledge additional auxiliary sensory information constrain perceptual interpretations
example knowing distance object helps perceiving its size
literature contains few demonstrations use prior knowledge auxiliary information combined visual haptic disambiguation almost no examination haptic disambiguation vision beyond bistable stimuli
previous studies reported humans integrate multiple unambiguous sensations perceive single continuous object properties like size position
here test whether humans use visual haptic information individually jointly disambiguate size distance
presented participants ball moving depth changing diameter
because no unambiguous distance information available under monocular viewing participants rely prior assumptions about ball's distance disambiguate their size percept
presenting auxiliary binocular and/or haptic distance information augments participants' prior distance assumptions improves their size judgment accuracy though binocular cues were trusted more than haptic
our results suggest both visual haptic distance information disambiguate size perception interpret results context probabilistic perceptual reasoning
 introduction 
well over century psychologists considered question how brain uses visual angle sensations make judgments object's size overcoming confounding effect its distance  but topic remains unsettled
holway boring found when strong sensations object's distance were made available human size matching performance at different distances was high but when distance sensations were removed human perception object's size was erroneously dominated its visual angle
epstein et al surveyed literature regarding size-distance invariance hypothesis holds retinal visual angle constrains perception object's size distance their ratio holds constant value concluded size-distance invariance hypothesis was subject variety failures
several studies attributed participants' mistaken size perceptions misjudgments physical distance while others point out specific experimental design choices task demands contribute reported failures size constancy
recently combe wexler reported size constancy stronger when relative distance between observer object varies due observer motion than when due object motion
findings highlight unsettled state current empirical knowledge about human size distance perception exacerbated absence unified theoretical account normative size/distance perception
hypothesize brain makes size inferences incorporating multiple sensations based knowledge their generative relationship physical environment properties failures like inaccuracy systematic biases due poverty unreliability and/or mistrust observed sensations
our experiments tackle issue how brain incorporates distance information particular binocular haptic jointly perceive how object's size changing
size-change perception surprisingly not been studied size/distance perception literature bears close similarity static size perception because size-change judgments based retinal image size ambiguous if information about object's motion-in-depth unknown
however when auxiliary sensations indicating motion-in-depth available observer may rule out size-change/motion combinations inconsistent auxiliary sensations unambiguously infer whether object inflating deflating
predicted despite inherent novelty stimuli participants' abilities discriminate whether object inflated deflated would depend availability quality information about its motion-in-depth
because binocular haptic sensations provide information about depth predicted they would each incorporated improving size-change judgments
thus our study answers two key questions: does brain use distance-change information size-change perception
what roles binocular haptic distance-change information
our size-change discrimination task presented participants object either inflated deflated while simultaneously either approaching receding asked them discriminate whether inflated deflated
most static size perception tasks use matching paradigms our task was advantageous because allowed us present single stimulus per trial avoid issues regarding relative comparison pairs stimuli
provided participants different types auxiliary motion-in-depth information binocular haptic both isolation simultaneously examined their inflation/deflation judgments evaluate how auxiliary distance information influenced perceived size-change
evidence use binocular haptic distance information size-change perception not been reported previous studies cue integration suggest brain combines haptic binocular information proportion its reliability jointly improve spatial perception
found when distance-change information was absent participants' size-change judgments closely matched object's image size-change
however when provided participants auxiliary distance-change sensations participants incorporated additional information form more accurate size percepts were consistent both monocular auxiliary sensations
moreover when both binocular haptic information was presented most participants showed greater disambiguation size than when either was presented isolation
results suggest size-change perception uses knowledge how multi-modal size distance sensations related interpret scene
interpret findings framework probabilistic perceptual inference available sensations combined according their relationship scene properties their respective reliabilities
