 introduction 
epithelia diverse tissues addition their apico-basal polarization acquire polarization within two-dimensional layer cells phenomenon called planar cell polarity
developing wing drosophila pcp determines growth direction small hairs extend radially cell boundaries
wild-type wing where cells approximately hexagonal form regular honeycomb lattice all hairs point distal direction
series recent experiments show several key proteins including transmembrane proteins frizzled van-gogh cytosolic proteins dishevelled prickled localize asymmetrically cell boundaries  defining direction plane within each cell forming characteristic zig-zag pattern protein localization lattice 
other experiments show local pcp orientation depends inter-cellular signaling
first mutant clones fz vang activity suppressed amplified cause characteristic reproducible inversion polarity large patches cells proximal distal clone
observations summarized figs
1 c,d second fat mutant clones hairs do not all point correctly distal direction yet their orientation strongly correlated between nearby cells varies gradually across tissue creating characteristic swirling pattern
thus experimental evidence suggests interaction between neighboring cells tends locally align their polarity
local polarity need not point distally unless addition there global orienting signal picks out distal direction throughout wing
yet aside clear involvement protocadherin fat molecular details pathway remains now unknown
swirling patterns fat mutants recent evidence suggest orienting field related presence gradient fat four-jointed dachs pathway
observations evoke analogy between pcp behavior ferromagnets extensively studied physics well understood terms statistical mechanics relatively simple models
models each atomic site assigned magnetic dipole spin assume different orientation
salient properties ferromagnets arise opposing influence interaction between neighboring spins tends co-align their orientation influence thermal fluctuations tend randomize spin direction
ferromagnets typically exhibit two phases behavior: high temperature phase where spins disordered low temperature ferromagnetic phase where interactions dominate over thermal fluctuations leading spontaneous polarization arbitrary direction
state even small external magnetic field big effect magnetic polarization spontaneous polarization aligns itself external field yet dynamics leading global alignment quite slow
essential lesson statistical mechanics ordered disordered states exist broad class models discussed general context focusing classification different regimes function few parameters
follow lesson focusing study competition between intercellular interaction disordering influence fluctuations introduced noisy molecular interactions
statistical mechanics define phase diagram identifies different regimes behavior space most relevant parameters
then address role global directional signal dynamics global alignment
molecular model pcp formation was recently proposed ref
was shown reproduce number experimental findings
model involves 38 parameters were adjusted successfully reproduce set wild-type mutant phenotypes
here pursue alternative approach instead moving more more complex models develop model smaller number degrees freedom smaller number parameters
instead fixing particular set parameters fitting data explore generic behavior model function parameters defining quantitative features characteristic different phases
formulating model identify several essential ingredients required obtain characteristic zig-zag pattern non-autonomy fz vang mutant clones
expect our simplified model capture important properties pcp although does not incorporate all molecular details
after discussing essential ingredients model obtain phase diagram describing its steady state properties
then consider dynamics local polarization strength orientation absence presence global orienting signal
show global alignment achieved weak global orienting signal provided present throughout tissue at earliest stage pcp dynamics
finally discuss experimental predictions coming out model tools required test predictions
