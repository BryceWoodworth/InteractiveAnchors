central feature our approach intermediate phenotypes quantified through use vivo measured repression strengths escherichia coli lac mutants
evolutionary pathways constructed multiple rounds single base pair substitutions selection tight independent binding
our analysis indicates when duplicated repressor co-diverges together its binding site fitness landscape allows funneling new regulatory interaction early increases fitness
find neutral mutations do not play essential role important substantial divergence probabilities
varying selective pressure pinpoint necessary ingredients observed divergence

 introduction 
initially put forward stevens 1951 later advocated ohno his seminal work gene duplication followed functional divergence now seen general mechanism acquiring new functions
also regulatory networks thought shaped significantly genetic duplication
instance sequence analysis transcription factor families points various historical duplication events
however very little known about subsequent mutational divergence pathways about corresponding stepwise phenotypical changes subject selection
while issues not yet been explored experimentally related generic aspects mutational plasticity been addressed theoretically
however central obstacle studying mutational pathways through computer simulations remains unknown relation between sequence binding affinity general rather mapping assumed
describe formation new regulatory interaction after duplication event our current aim approach would particularly speculative
here reason many characteristics adaptation real protein-dna contacts hidden extensive body mutational data been accumulated over many years
measured repression values used fitness landscapes pathways explored computing consecutive rounds single base pair substitutions selection
here develop approach study divergence duplicate repressors their binding sites
more specifically focus creation new unique protein-dna recognition starting two identical repressors two identical operators
consider selective conditions favor evolution toward independent regulation
interestingly regulatory divergence inherently coevolutionary process where repressors operators must optimized coordinated fashion
mere presence selective pressure clearly not sufficient condition achieve new function
rather evolutionary potential limitations seen governed shape actual fitness landscape evolutionary search within
studying intrinsic limitations divergence represents overall aim work
many open questions arise when considering formation new protein-dna interaction may viewed construction new lock uniquely matching key
instance how should protein modified step-by-step recognize new dna-binding site also does not yet exist vice versa
one would expect complementary mutations need occur protein dna-binding site
does mean temporary losses fitness must endured when taking single-mutation steps
how many mutations must minimally accumulate before noticeable new recognition obtained selection act
latter important point: mutations conferring selective advantage spread more readily through population resulting drastic increase divergence probability
questions addressed exhaustively searching landscape optimal pathways well complementary population dynamics simulations
previously been shown lac repressor mutants indeed exist bind exclusively mutant lac operators
our simulations reveal duplicated repressor-operator pair readily evolve achieve independence binding while monotonously increasing its fitness step-by-step process
moreover simply following fittest mutants does predominantly guide system desired global optimum indicates funnel-like features fitness landscape
detailed analysis subsequent network changes indicates generic sequence events study underlying mechanisms varying applied selective pressure
next show trajectories find optimal pathway simulations not rare exceptions since similar trajectories followed using probabilistic scheme accepting mutation
results further suggest feasibility studying regulatory divergence laboratory evolution experiments finally make comparison alternative models creation new regulatory interactions
