 
two main agents human malaria plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum induce severe anemia provoke strong complex immune reactions
dynamical behaviors host immune erythropoietic responses would foster control infection would lead runaway parasitemia and/or severe anemia
answer questions developed differential equation models interacting parasite red blood cell populations modulated host immune erythropoietic responses
model immune responses incorporate both rapidly responding innate component slower-responding long-term antibody component several parasite developmental stages considered targets each type immune response
found simulated infections highest parasitemia tended those ineffective innate immunity even if antibodies were present
also compared infections dyserythropoiesis those compensatory erythropoiesis fixed basal rbc production rate
dyserythropoiesis tended reduce parasitemia slightly but at cost host aggravating anemia
other hand compensatory erythropoiesis tended reduce severity anemia but enhanced parasitemia if innate response was ineffective
both parasite species sharp transitions between schizont merozoite stages development were associated lower parasitemia less severe anemia
thus tight synchronization asexual parasite development might help control parasitemia
finally our simulations suggest p vivax induce severe anemia readily p falciparum same type immune response though p vivax attacks much smaller subset rbcs
since most p vivax infections nonlethal clinically suggests p falciparum adaptations countering evading immune responses more effective than those p vivax
 introduction 
parasites cause human malaria inoculated anopheles mosquito initially multiply liver
after about week primary wave merozoite forms enters bloodstream invades rbcs continues asexual cycle multiplication developing into schizont forms burst release more merozoites
pathology malaria due asexual blood stage cycle
sexual forms transmissible mosquitoes appear over time but much smaller numbers than asexual forms
two parasite species cause vast majority human cases plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum induce severe anemia; p vivax especially anemia appear far out proportion percentage rbcs infected 
both innate adaptive arms human immune system mount responses infections both species
high fevers classic feature infections
during p vivax infections near-periodic episodes fever associated high levels tumor necrosis factor other cytokines associated innate immunity
strong cytokine responses also occur p falciparum infection though timing paroxysms tends irregular
fever paroxysms associated synchronized release merozoites bursting schizonts
synchronization been subject considerable experimental theoretical work
possible febrile temperatures induce synchronization differentially influencing development rates different parasite stages immune responses well host's melatonin release cycle contribute phenomenon
but not yet clear whether synchronization helps parasites perhaps way sudden overwhelming abundance prey may overwhelm predator's capacity hinders them
malaria parasites certainly evolved mechanisms immune evasion; however p falciparum exhibits antigenic variation adheres vascular endothelium response fever produces prostaglandins probably modulate host tnf production
species also manages keep membrane infected rbcs deformable during its ring stage apparently reducing exposure ring-stage parasites clearance spleen
p vivax also evade spleen clearance suppress immune responses directed against its liver stage 
clinical investigations suggest malaria parasite host immune response interact host erythropoietic system complex dynamic manner
increased production tnf host apparently induces anemia ; experimental evidence suggests hemozoin produced p falciparum suppresses rbc production
abnormalities observed p falciparum-infected patients include suppression erythroid progenitor cells bone marrow sequestration parasites marrow decreased iron absorption hemoglobin synthesis decreased rbc survival time
leucocyte infiltration marrow erythroblast degradation macrophages been observed p vivax infections
phagocytosis uninfected rbcs been observed vitro p berghei-infected mice suspected human malaria
p chabaudi-infected mice show enhanced erythropoiesis compensate rbc loss ; humans elevated levels erythropoietin produced response p falciparum infection
overall evidence suggests rbc destruction ineffective erythropoiesis may thwart erythropoietin-initiated processes might otherwise compensate rbc loss although erythropoietin may other protective effects 
most fatal malaria infections due p falciparum induce cerebral complications well severe anemia
p vivax infections characterized lower levels parasitemia though often debilitating rarely fatal
p falciparum attacks rbcs all ages while p vivax mainly attacks reticulocytes possibly rbcs up two weeks old
previous report argued targeted depletion youngest rbcs makes p vivax infection potentially much more dangerous than commonly appreciated: unchecked growth p vivax population would eventually prevent replacement older uninfected rbcs senesce culled circulation
thus one might expect strong immune response p vivax despite its seemingly lower threat relative p falciparum
furthermore model did not incorporate immune response compensatory boosting rbc production tended increase parasitemia while dyserythropoietic response had opposite effect
here consider compartmentalized ordinary differential equations representing p vivax p falciparum infections incorporate quick-acting innate response longer-term acquired antibody response well dynamic erythropoietic system

innate response emulates aspects fever paroxysm response hallmark symptom malaria
analyze how components jointly affect parasite rbc dynamics
do not attempt model full complexity immune response malaria infections: our aim assess potential trade-offs between host parasite given characteristics immune erythropoietic responses
however do consider several choices targets both innate antibody responses model
assume bursting schizonts activate innate response stage triggers antibody response same stage targets
also consider different values time constant decay effective clearance rate parasites antibody response
time constant not necessarily biochemical decay constant actual antibodies also incorporates possibility long lived population b-cells producing antibodies
models also incorporate nonzero standard deviation time parasites develop within rbcs
show host erythopoietic response affect infection outcome even presence sustained immunological action
show how infection outcome varies life stages parasite targeted model immune responses
furthermore show tight synchronization merozoite release does not necessarily help parasite populations evade host immune responses
most our simulated infections assume host no pre-existing antibodies memory b cells parasite but some examples examine effects pre-existing antibodies
