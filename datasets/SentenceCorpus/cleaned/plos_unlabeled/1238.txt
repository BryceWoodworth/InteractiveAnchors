 introduction 
important challenge analyses high throughput datasets integration data prior knowledge interactions measured molecules retrieval most relevant biomolecular networks
approach facilitates interpretation data within context known functional interactions between biological molecules subsequently leads high-confidence hypothesis generation
typically procedure would entail identification genes highest lowest data values then followed identification associated networks
however retrieval most relevant biological networks/pathways associated upper lower end data distribution not trivial task mainly because members biological pathway do not usually similar data values necessitates use various computational algorithms finding networks genes
one class methods finding relevant networks utilize optimization procedures finding highest-scoring subnetworks/pathways genes based data values genes
although approach likely result highly relevant networks computationally expensive inefficient therefore not suitable routine analyses functional genomics data lab
most popular existing methods extraction relevant networks genomic data however usually involve network building strategy using pre-defined focus gene set typically set genes most significant data values
network built filling other nodes network either based enrichment interactions focus set based analysis shortest paths between focus genes
both methods aim at identifying genes network most central connecting focus genes each other
problems associated methods been outlined previously
however perhaps most importantly central genes identified methods may incoherent data values focus genes data values nodes not accounted during network construction process using seed gene list
may result uninformative networks not representative networks most significantly represented genomic data
addition methods do not account genes more subtle data values collectively may more important than those more obvious data values
although powerful data analysis methods finding sets genes significant albeit subtle expression changes been developed approach not been incorporated into methods extracting interaction networks most highlighted data
order overcome problems employed method random walks graphs scoring relevance interactions network data
method random walks been well-established structural analyses networks fully account local well global topological structure within network very useful identifying most important/central nodes
here instead working pre-defined set focus genes overlay entire data distribution onto network bias random walk probabilities based data values associated nodes
method netwalk generates distribution edge flux values each interaction network then used dynamical network building further statistical analyses
here describe concept netwalk demonstrate its usefulness extracting relevant networks compared ingenuity pathway analysis show use netwalk results comparative analyses highlighted networks between different conditions

using netwalk identify several previously unreported network processes involved doxorubicin-induced cell death
studies propose netwalk valuable network based analysis tool integrates biological high throughput data prior knowledge networks define sub-networks genes modulated biologically meaningful way
use netwalk will greatly facilitate analysis genomic data
