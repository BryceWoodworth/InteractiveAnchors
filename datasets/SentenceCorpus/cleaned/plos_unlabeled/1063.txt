 introduction 
cytoskeletal microfilament networks contribute mechanical stability cell dynamically arranging rearranging actin filaments reinforcement
dynamic arrangement actin filament requires actin filament crosslinking molecules actinin
actinin 200 kda homodimer three major structural motifs: actin binding domain calmodulin homology domain central rod domain
each monomer contains all three structural domains but two monomers arranged anti-parallel so two abds at opposite ends actinin
arrangement two abds at opposite ends allows actinin crosslink parallel actin filaments
actin filaments parallel arrangement very dynamic; actin filaments move laterally horizontally relationship each other continuously bind unbind actinin crosslinking molecules
several cellular processes involving actin filament dynamic rearrangement scaffolding actinin include: focal adhesion formation near membrane bound integrin molecules cytokinesis cytoplasmic dumping final stages mitosis z-disk formation stabilization muscle cells
order actinin maintain its function actin filament scaffold dynamic environment actinin molecule must partially flexible meaning must simultaneously rigid stable at some regions resist external stress flexible at other regions maintain binding dynamic environment 
structure actinin rod domain underlies function actinin partially flexible actin filament crosslinker
each central rod domain monomer 240 long made up 4 spectrin repeats connected helical linkers
other molecules spectrin repeats include dystophin utrophin
actinin rod domain differs other spectrin family molecules its shorter length its more rigid helical linkers its dimerization
spectrin repeats structure rod domain contributes several vital characteristics actinin rod domain: aromatic packing hydrophobic residues within each repeat stabilize secondary structure ; acidic basic surfaces r1 r4 confer strong dimerization interactions kd 10 pm between monomers ; interaction hydrophobic residues between r2 r3 both monomers electrostatic interactions produce coiled-coil homodimer conformation 12 degree bend 90 degree left handed twist

coiled-coil nature rod domain essential component rod domain structure
coiled-coils dominant conformation fibrous proteins
most coiled-coils heptad conformation hydrophobic residues every seventh residue
heptad conformation allows hydrophobic insertion one linker region into other monomers knobs-into-holes mechanism
presence heptad hydrophobic residues common coiled-coil structure but neither necessary nor sufficient
coiled-coils antiparallel dimers like actinin rod domain stabilized mainly electrostatic interactions between monomers within monomers
general knobs-into-holes mechanism coiled-coil conformation exists only when stabilized electrostatic interactions
