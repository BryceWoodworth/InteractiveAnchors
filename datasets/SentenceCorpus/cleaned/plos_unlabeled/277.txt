theoretical model based differential equations hypoxia response network been previously proposed sharp response changes oxygen concentration was observed but not quantitatively explained
model consisted reactions involving 23 molecular species among concentrations hif oxygen were linked through complex set reactions
paper analyze previous model using combination mathematical tools draw out key components network explain quantitatively how they contribute sharp oxygen response
find switch-like behavior due pathway-switching wherein hif degrades rapidly under normoxia one pathway while other pathway accumulates hif trigger downstream genes under hypoxia
analytic technique potentially useful studying larger biomedical networks
 introduction 
molecular oxygen terminal electron acceptor mitochondrial electron transport chain
