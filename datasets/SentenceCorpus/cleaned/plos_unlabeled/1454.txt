 
rates hospital-acquired infections methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increasingly used quality indicators hospital hygiene
alternatively rates may vary between hospitals because hospitals differ admission referral potentially colonized patients
assessed if different referral patterns between hospitals health care networks influence rates hospital-acquired infections like mrsa
used dutch medical registration 2004 measure connectedness between hospitals
allowed us reconstruct network hospitals netherlands
used mathematical models assess effect different patient referral patterns potential spread hospital-acquired infections between hospitals between categories hospitals
university hospitals higher number shared patients than teaching general hospitals therefore more likely among first receive colonized patients
moreover network directional towards university hospitals they higher prevalence even when infection control measures equally effective all hospitals
patient referral patterns profound effect spread health care-associated infections like hospital-acquired mrsa
mrsa prevalence therefore differs between hospitals position each hospital within health care network
any comparison mrsa rates between hospitals benchmark hospital hygiene should therefore take position hospital within network into account
 introduction 
pathogens typically cause hospital-acquired infections opportunistic nature
organisms usually part normal bacterial flora humans only cause disease when reaching body sites normally free bacterial colonization e.g when anatomical barriers breached due trauma medical/surgical interventions
reason severe problems nosocomial pathogens mainly seen very young elderly most frequently institutions hospitals long-term care facilities where patients treated acute chronic conditions
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus antimicrobial resistant variant s aureus common bacteria frequently colonizing healthy humans animals
emergence mrsa due acquisition large dna fragment seems rare
expansion limited number mrsa clones characterizes current epidemic hospitals worldwide therefore believed result between patient transmission only minor extent due de novo emergence patients exposed antibiotics
mrsa therefore become marker success failure hospital infection control 
prevalence mrsa differs considerably within between countries
currently about 30 percent s aureus causing bloodstream infections uk resistant methicillin against only 1 percent netherlands scandinavian countries
although high endemic countries mrsa infections frequent all hospitals proportions highest large teaching hospitals also report highest frequency newly occurring mrsa clones
severity underlying medical condition patients well higher antibiotic use frequency invasive procedures been proposed main reasons difference 
patients carry mrsa asymptomatically long time
when readmitted they may introduce pathogen acquired during previous admission into new hospital
failure one hospital's infection control measures therefore affect prevalence hospitals shares patients
patients referred hospitals at different rates depending function hospitals within health-care system likely affect prevalence at different institutions
referral patterns might therefore offer explanation high mrsa incidence hospitals tertiary referral level
but referral patterns account differences spread between hospitals differences observed prevalence
answer questions been mapping health care network based large national medical registry evaluated occurrence hospital-acquired infections different care categories under simulated epidemic conditions
