16 21 tfs all other motif-finding methods failed find significant motif phylogibbs did recover motif matches literature consensus
11 cases where there was disagreement results compiled lists known target genes literature found running phylogibbs their regulatory regions yielded binding motif matching literature consensus all but one cases

 introduction 
transcription factors proteins bind sequence-specific manner short dna segments most commonly intergenic dna upstream gene activate suppress gene transcription
their dna-binding domains recognize collections short related dna sequences
one generally finds although there no unique combination bases shared all binding sites although different bases occur at each position there clear biases distribution bases occur at each position binding sites
common mathematical representation motif takes variability into account so-called weight matrix w whose components w i give probabilities finding base c g t at position i binding site
main assumption underlying mathematical representation bases occurring at different positions binding site probabilistically independent
turn follows under some conditions assumption binding energy protein dna sum pairwise contact energies between individual nucleotides protein
there several algorithms based wm representation detect ab initio binding sites common tf collection dna sequences
algorithms broadly fall into two classes
one class meme typical representative searches space all wms wm best explain observed sequences
class gibbs sampling algorithms gibbs motif sampler typical representative instead samples space all multiple alignments small sequence segments search one most likely consist samples common wm
crucial factor success ab initio methods ratio number binding sites total amount dna collection sequences
larger number binding sites set smaller total amount dna more likely ab initio methods discover binding sites among other dna sequences
order ensure reasonable chance success one thus needs provide methods collections sequences highly enriched binding sites common tf
one possibility use sets upstream regions genes appear co-regulated microarray experiments were bound common tf chip-on-chip experiments
another possibility use upstream regions orthologous genes related organisms
here assumption regulation ancestor gene thus its binding sites been conserved orthologs descend
latter approach general complicated number factors
when searching regulatory sites sequences not phylogenetically related upstream regions different genes same organism one may simply look short sequence motifs overrepresented among input sequences
if set species orthologous sequences derive sufficiently diverged one may simply choose ignore phylogenetic relationship between sequences treat orthologous sequences same way sequences not phylogenetically related
was instance approach taken mccue et al where gibbs motif sampler algorithm was used upstream regions proteo bacteria
however approach not applicable datasets containing more closely related species where some sequences will exhibit significant amounts similarity simply because their evolutionary proximity
moreover amount similarity will depend phylogenetic distance between species clear finding conserved sequence motifs between orthologous sequences closely related species much less indicative function than finding sequence motifs conserved between distant species
one will general thus distinguish conservation due functional constraints conservation due evolutionary proximity do correctly phylogenetic relationship between sequences taken into account
second challenge using orthologous intergenic sequences multiple species nontrivial structure their multiple alignments
one typically finds very heterogeneous pattern conservation: well-conserved blocks different sizes covering different subsets species interspersed sequence segments show little similarity sequences other species
technique phylogenetic footprinting restricts attention only those sequence segments genome interest show significant conservation other species
conserved regions multiple genes then searched common motifs variety techniques
unclear however what extent regulatory sites restricted conserved segments
instance several studies drosophila yeast shown there no strong correlation between where experimentally annotated binding sites occur whether region conserved
thus at least yeast flies considerable information lost focusing conserved regions only
thus decided retain entire patchwork pattern conserved sequence blocks unaligned segments
our strategy implemented gibbs sampling approach preliminary account algorithm was presented
algorithm operates arbitrary collections both phylogenetically related sequences orthologous intergenic regions sequences not phylogenetically related upstream regions different genes same organism
phylogenetically related groups sequences input pre-aligned into local multiple alignments where clearly similar sequence segments aligned into blocks sequence segments no marginal similarity left unaligned
although algorithm also take global multiple alignments input believe often force phylogenetically unrelated segments into aligned blocks
may adversely affect performance algorithm
score putative sites within blocks aligned sequences evolutionary model takes phylogenetic relationships species into account while putative sites unaligned segments treated independent occurrences
bayesian model defines probability distribution over arbitrary placements putative binding sites multiple motifs sample monte carlo markov chain
first use simulated annealing search globally optimal configuration binding sites
motifs configuration then tracked further sampling run estimate realistic posterior probabilities all binding sites algorithm reports
recently number other algorithms been developed search regulatory motifs groups phylogenetically related sequences
probably first algorithm was proposed generalization consensus algorithm called phylocon
phylocon operates sets co-regulated genes their orthologs
greedy algorithm first finds ungapped alignments similar sequence segments sets orthologous sequences then combines alignments different upstream regions into larger alignments
algorithm does not take any phylogenetic information into account i.e closely related sequences treated same distantly related sequences
other drawbacks algorithm assumes each motif will exactly one site each intergenic regions assumes site conserved all orthologs
more closely related phylogibbs's approach two recent algorithms generalize meme take phylogenetic relationships between species into account
main difference between emnem phyme phyme uses same evolutionary model evolution binding sites phylogibbs takes into account binding sites evolve under constraints set wm whereas emnem simply assumes overall slower rate evolution binding sites than background sequences
another difference phyme like phylogibbs treats multiple alignment more flexibly than emnem demands global multiple alignment
main difference between phylogibbs algorithms course phylogibbs takes motif sampling approach allows us search multiple motifs parallel whereas phyme emnem use expectation maximization search one wm at time
following sections first describe our bayesian model assigns posterior probability each configuration binding sites multiple motifs assigned input sequences
start describing model phylogenetically unrelated sequences essentially equivalent model used gibbs motif sampler then describe how model extended datasets contain phylogenetically related sequences
after describe move set search state space all possible configurations annealing tracking strategy use identify significant groups sites
then present examples performance ours other algorithms both synthetic real data
synthetic datasets consist mixtures wm samples random sequences accordance assumptions all algorithms make
allows us compare performance algorithms idealized situation does not contain complexities real data
tests also show what extent binding sites recovered idealized data function quality wms number sites available number species available their phylogenetic distances
our tests real data use 200 upstream regions saccharomyces cerevisiae known binding sites collection compare ability different algorithms recover sites when running multiple alignments orthologs upstream regions recently sequenced saccharomyces genomes
finally run phylogibbs collections upstream region alignments were annotated contain binding sites common tf based data chip-on-chip experiments extensively compare phylogibbs' results annotations literature
