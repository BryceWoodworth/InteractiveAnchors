 introduction 
heat shock protein 90 essential atpase directed molecular chaperone required folding quality control maturation trafficking client proteins
hsp90 represents fundamental hub protein interaction networks key roles many cellular functions
hsp90 oversees correct maturation activation trafficking among specialized cellular compartments wide range client proteins

client proteins typically include numerous kinases transcription factors other proteins serve nodal points integrating cellular responses multiple signals
given its role at intersection fundamental cellular pathways becoming increasingly clear hsp90 deregulation associated many pathologies ranging cancer protein folding disorders neurological diseases
because role disease development pharmacological suppression hsp90 activity become area very intense research molecular oncology particular
targeted suppression hsp90 atpase activity small molecule inhibitor benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin some its derivatives shown promising anticancer activity preclinical models recently completed safety evaluation humans
further clinical trials also been initiated other small molecules also used drug combinations various cancer types 
hsp90 operates dimer complex cycle driven atp binding hydrolysis atp/adp exchange
initial structural efforts concentrated isolated individual domains human yeast hsp90 er homologue grp94 escherichia coli homologue htpg
crystal structures larger constructs also been reported
first x-ray crystal structures full-length hsp90 yeast bound atp mimic amppnp revealed homodimeric structure individual protomers twisted parallel arrangement
each protomer turn characterized modular architecture three well-defined domains: n-terminal regulatory domain responsible atp binding middle domain completes atpase site necessary atp hydrolysis binds client proteins c-terminal dimerization domain required dimerization
same global topology shared atp-bound states e.coli homolog htpg endoplasmatic reticulum paralog grp94
interestingly crystal structures full-length constructs htpg grp94 complex either adp apo state showed substantially different conformations
htpg apo state adopted open structure each three domains exposed hydrophobic surface area while adp-bound form hydrophobic surfaces clustered form more compact state 
structural biochemical studies solution state hsp90 its complexes using small angle x-ray scattering provided first experimental evidence highly dynamic stochastic nature hsp90 whereby equilibrium between different conformational states molecular chaperone readily shifted recruit hsp90 conformation suitable efficient cdc37 co-chaperone recognition
more recent solution structure data obtained using saxs single particle cryo-electron microscopy modeling approaches showed apo-hsp90 dimer may equilibrium among different open extended states still preserving constitutive dimerization provided ctds nucleotide binding may shift equilibrium towards compact conformations
particular saxs data revealed adp-bound compact state htpg equilibrium extended state could significantly populated absence crystal packing effects
contrast crystal structures amppnp adp-bound forms er-paralog grp94 showed there relatively little difference conformation between two nucleotide bound states crystal representing extended structures
recent studies based mutation analysis cross-linking electron microscopy suggested different compact states accessed grp94 presence atp
studies indicated upon binding specific partner functional states hsp90 recruited using intrinsic conformational flexibility hsp90
although exact mechanism coupling between atp-binding/hydrolysis client protein folding still unclear combination x-ray structural observations biochemical data supports picture chaperone undergoes conformational rearrangements bringing two ntds close association atp-bound state but not adp-bound apo states
defines conformational cycle involves constitutive dimerization through ctds transient atp-dependent dimerization ntds molecular clamp mechanism
terms intrinsic protein dynamics mechanism conformational coupling atpase cycle involves tense structurally rigid conformational state hsp90 upon atp binding whereas subsequent hydrolysis adp leads more relaxed structurally flexible state hsp90
finally nucleotide-free form dimer moves open state
crystal structures full-length dimer also highlight remarkable flexibility atp-lid segment composed two helices intervening loop located immediately adjacent atp binding site
lid displaced its position isolated hsp90 ntd structure folds over nucleotide pocket interact bound atp yielding closed conformation indicating its possible importance progression chaperone cycle
studies reminiscent results h/d exchange mass spectrometry investigations human hsp90 solution showed co-chaperone inhibitor binding ntd induce conformational changes at hsp90 domain-domain interfaces
moreover frey coworkers shown kinetic equilibrium binding constants depend intrinsic conformational equilibrium hsp90 obtained different species reflecting differential affinity reactivity towards atp
kinetic analysis atpase cycle suggested during atpase cycle grp94 may predominantly open state
contrast yeast hsp90 open state only populated 20 percent closed structure observed presence nucleotides
hence conformational transitions during atpase cycle structurally similar different hsp90 proteins while energetic balance between individual steps may species-dependent manifested differences binding kinetics
overall solution data suggested molecular mechanism hsp90 chaperone cycle more adequately described stochastic process atp binding shift intrinsic conformational equilibrium hsp90 between open apo state adp-bound compact atp-bound closed protein state seen different crystal structures
most recent structural studies apo nucleotide-bound conformations e coli yeast human hsp90 homologs further supported existence universal three-state conformational cycle hsp90 consisting open-apo atp-closed adp-compact nucleotide-stabilized states whereby intrinsic conformational equilibrium between states highly-species dependent
according results evolutionary pressure may act through thermodynamic stabilization functionally relevant hsp90 conformations recruited conformational equilibrium ensure adequate response presence organism-specific co-chaperones protein clients
importantly atp adp binding shift conformational equilibrium far away apo state e coli yeast hsp90 whereas conformational equilibrium human hsp90 largely dominated open form even presence nucleotide binding
strikingly study shown nucleotide binding provides only small stabilization energy thereby biasing rather than determining occupancy different conformational states existing dynamic equilibrium
overall intrinsic conformational flexibility hsp90 critical molecular chaperon cycle including structural adaptation diversity co-chaperones client proteins
different steps cycle accompanied binding different co-chaperone proteins specific functions
hop co-chaperone instance arrests atp hydrolysis binds simultaneously hsp70 molecular chaperone coupling two systems
hop binding hsp90 involves interactions at both m-domains ctd domains stabilizing conformation incompetent atp hydrolysis n-terminal dimerization
contrast stress-regulated co-chaperone aha1 substantially increases atpase rates increasing hsp90 chaperone activities
case binding other co-chaperones cpr6 sba1 was shown atp-binding hydrolysis required ensure productive complex formation: interestingly sba1 binds ntd while cpr6 binds ctd
observations suggest role nucleotide selecting stabilizing different conformations hsp90 related specific different functions chaperone cycle
