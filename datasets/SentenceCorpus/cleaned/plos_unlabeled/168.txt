 introduction 
popular image human brain closely associated intricate folds cerebral cortex
cortical landscape been described measured interpreted since age phrenology
mammalian cerebral cortex evolved expanded tangentially folded accommodate large surface area measuring 1,600 2,000 cm 2 humans three times larger than inner surface skull 
classic studies described cortical morphology frequently reference its geometric regularity
various hypotheses were proposed development convolutions active growth pressure friction expanding cortex tangentially against skull underlying brain structures mechanical bulging unequal regional expansion
other concepts suggested cortical buckling results differential laminar growth convolutions shaped through attached axonal fibers
more specifically been proposed but not yet rigorously tested 3-d shape brain reflects viscoelastic tension exerted axonal fibers
according hypothesis global competition mechanical forces results formation gyri between densely linked regions sulci between weakly connected unconnected regions
axonal tension hypothesis particularly attractive since implies characteristic cortical morphology arises automatically interconnections different cortical areas without need individual specification convolutions
moreover cortical folding through axonal tension implicitly achieves desirable reduction volume cortical fibers 
mechanical factors been invoked most models development cortical convolutions but see also discussion active growth convolutions
mechanical forces may also role observed trends laminar cortical morphology deformation neurons blood vessels different parts cortical landscape
nevertheless rapid progress research into genetic control brain development during recent decades sidelined mechanical concepts favor genetic models explaining morphology convoluted cortex
beause apparent complexity cortical morphology fact many aspects cortical development still poorly understood there great need establishing systematic reliable quantitative data architecture brain order evaluate different morphological concepts
here address two questions related role mechanical factors cortical morphology: overall pattern connections adult convoluted cortex consistent hypothesis axonal tension underlies formation cortical convolutions
systematic variations adult cortical architecture related cortical convolutions
both questions addressed through analysis quantitative data connections architecture prefrontal cortex adult nonhuman primates
quantitative tract tracing animals convoluted cortex offers most detailed reliable information currently available about density trajectories cortical projections
retrograde tract tracing particular ideal purpose because each projection neuron labeled transport tracer through individual axons injection site back parent cell body
count labeled neurons therefore provides good estimate number axons link given pair cortices
over last two decades systematically accumulated quantitative data connections prefrontal cortex gyrencephalic nonhuman primate rhesus monkey
addition obtained quantitative architectonic data all prefrontal areas same species
using databases provide quantitative evidence consistent key role mechanical factors three interrelated aspects cortical morphology: formation cortical convolutions through axonal tension; shaping laminar morphology through cortical folding; nonuniform distribution neurons cortical layers may result interaction tensile compressive folding forces neuronal migration during development
some findings were previously reported conference proceedings
