 introduction 
first generation vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus designed prevent hiv acquisition stimulating neutralizing antibodies failed protect efficacy trials
second-generation vaccines been designed elicit hiv-specific cellular immune responses
candidates supported evidence so-called killer t cells cytotoxic t lymphocytes bearing cd8 membrane-molecule react kill infected target cells play crucial role controlling hiv infection 
first efficacy trial named step t cell directed hiv vaccine began december 2004; being conducted merck research laboratories collaboration hiv vaccine trials network division aids at us national institutes health
candidate vaccine consists three vectors ferry hiv proteins into human cells
vaccine elicits broad t cell responses majority vaccinated hiv-uninfected adults
step trial will randomize 3,000 hiv uninfected volunteers receive mrkad5 placebo 1:1 ratio follow participants until 100 hiv infections occur
mehrotra li gilbert provide details trial
second step trial mrkad5 nearly identical design will begin south africa 2006
co-primary endpoints step trials hiv infection clinical measure disease: setpoint viral load
terminology reflects typical course hiv disease appears first flu-like illness progresses through stable asymptomatic phase then progresses aids
viral load typically measured blood drawn sometime after primary stage
even without preventing infection vaccine suppresses viral load could confer benefit individual slowing progression aids preventing need antiretroviral treatment; community reducing hiv transmission
second primary analysis step compares viral load setpoints among hiv-infected subjects vaccine placebo groups
besides unprecedented nature trials nontraditional design presented statistical challenge
because subjects included viral-load comparison determined post-randomization event hiv infection analysis susceptible selection bias
specifically conventional analysis viral load differences would not uniquely assess causal effect vaccine but rather mixture causal vaccine-effect effects variables correlated viral load
latter may unevenly distributed between infected-vaccinated infected-placebo groups
example selection bias would occur if vaccine protects hiv infection only vaccinees relatively strong immune system implies infected vaccine group would weaker immunologically than infected placebo group
consequently even if vaccine no causal effect viremia viral loads vaccine group would expected higher than those placebo group
failing account selection bias would lead incorrect inference vaccine harmfully increases viral load
preparation analysis step trials gilbert bosch hudgens other investigators developed statistical techniques assessing vaccine effect viral load allow plausible levels selection bias
however papers did not consider underlying biological mechanisms could account causal vaccine effects
rather they simulated arbitrary effects studied purely statistical operating characteristics methodology
evaluate statistical methods more biologically relevant manner consider here various mechanistic hypotheses vaccine effects
at their present stage development mathematical models hiv infection immune system made few compelling predictions primarily because uncertainty about most important mechanisms values rate-constants
nevertheless models attained enough maturity they quantitatively reproduce drop primary viremia after appearance hiv-specific ctls lag between peak viremia peak immune response formation steady state other aspects hiv infection
addition exploit recent estimate rate at hiv-specific ctls kill hiv-infected cells
building developments constructed new stochastic models primary infection immune response made surprising observation: does not appear implausible ctls might abort hiv infection
using infection co-primary endpoint setpoint viral load designers step trials explicitly acknowledged possibility
purposes discussion let us distinguish prevention eradication infection
prevention will mean either no productively infected target cells arise at all pool does not expand beyond some small number cells; afterward driven extinction
number pits at any time insufficient cause disease
favorable outcome might described transient infection sterilizing immunity depending assays employed detect exposure
eradication restrict consistent common usage clearing infection after primary symptomatic viremia
because cd8 t cells require priming step expansion period before they clear infected cells most immunologists regard preventing infection defined unlikely
vaccines against simian immunodeficiency virus not prevented infection may consequence large inoculums used experiments
more relevant hiv observation t cell memory hiv antigens frequently exposed but seronegative sex workers kenya
one mechanistic interpretation finding productive cellular infection was initially established but was either cleared ctls went extinct due chance
transient infection left behind small pool latently infected resting cd4 t cells due occasional activation events continuously expose immune system hiv antigens maintaining ctl memory
however investigators could not prove hiv-specific ctls actually protected women
but vaccine-derived adoptively transferred ctls prevented infection other viruses; particular sendai ebola mice
however may judge plausibility prevention t cells interested here impact statistical estimation incorporate some biological mechanism into our simulations
combined stochastic deterministic models so simulate impact t cells both probability infection given exposure viral load assuming infection vaccinated unvaccinated subjects
course concatenation requires more hypotheses particular about vaccine action
again because extent uncertainty about mechanisms do not claim predict outcome vaccine trials
rather models provide cases where influence selection bias present absent when present magnitude resulting biological scenarios rather than ad hoc assumptions
then generate thousands hypothetical step trials put gbh method test
step trials two vaccine efficacy parameters will assessed; one-minus-relative-risk hiv infection difference mean viral load setpoint hiv-infected subjects where setpoint viral load defined average two log10 plasma hiv rna levels measured at month 2 3 visits after diagnosis hiv infection
data will analyzed using adaption gbh method estimates causal vaccine effect viral load while accounting plausible levels selection bias
technique was developed potential outcomes framework causal inference
framework each trial participant two potential hiv infection outcomes: one under assignment vaccine one under assignment placebo
following gbh causal effect viral load defined subpopulation always-infected subjects who would become hiv-infected regardless randomization vaccine placebo
effect causal because always-infected subpopulations two study arms identical characteristics except vaccine/placebo assignment therefore observed differences directly attributable vaccination
methods estimate average causal effect vaccine viral load equal difference mean setpoint viral loads always-infected subpopulation
fundamental difficulty evaluating ace lack knowledge about infected subjects always-infected group knowing would require data subjects' hiv infection outcome both under assignment vaccine under assignment placebo but each subject only one outcomes observed
address identifiability problem gbh made simplifying assumption vaccine does not increase risk infection any subject posited model whether infected placebo recipient setpoint viral load y would been infected had they been assigned vaccine
model indexed sensitivity parameter log odds ratio infection under assignment vaccine comparing two infected placebo recipients setpoint viral loads y y 1
value 0 reflects case no selection bias case naive analysis assesses causal vaccine effect positive values reflect selection bias odds infection higher larger setpoint viral loads y parameter fixed investigator at each possible value within plausible range each gbh provided procedures estimating ace confidence interval

first step trial panel ten experts proposed plausible range log log; see discussion section
cautious our analysis will estimate ace over somewhat wider range namely log log; i.e 1,2
