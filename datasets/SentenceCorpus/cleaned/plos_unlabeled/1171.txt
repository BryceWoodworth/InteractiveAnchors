 introduction 
phylogenetic inference molecular sequences becoming increasingly popular tool trace patterns pathogen dispersal
time-scale epidemic spread usually provides ample time rapidly evolving viruses accumulate informative mutations their genomes
consequence spatial diffusion among other processes leave measurable footprint sampled gene sequences viruses
reconstructing both evolutionary history spatial process sequences provides fundamental understanding evolutionary dynamics underlying epidemics e.g
also hoped insights translated effective intervention prevention strategies elucidating key factors viral transmission gene flow over larger distances central formulating strategies e.g 
phylogeographic analyses common approach molecular ecology connecting historical processes evolution spatial distributions traditionally scale over millions years
many popular phylogeographic approaches remiss ignoring interaction between evolutionary processes spatial-temporal domains
one first reconstructs phylogeny omitting spatial information then conditions phylogeographic inferences reconstruction exploiting non-parametric tests evaluate significance conditional structure e.g
draw conclusions about epidemic origin epidemiological linkage between locations however require reconstruction dispersal patterns process throughout evolutionary history
considering locations discrete states boils down well-known problem ancestral state inference
parsimony popular heuristic approach map characters onto single phylogenetic tree
unfortunately parsimony reconstructions ignore important sources model uncertainty including both uncertainty dispersal process well unknown phylogeny
addition minimizing number state exchanges over phylogeny misleading when rates evolution rapid when state exchange probabilities unequal 
probabilistic methods draw explicit model state evolution permitting ability glimpse complete state history over entire phylogeny conveniently draw statistical inferences
analyses typically employ continuous-time markov chain models discrete state evolution analogous common nucleotide codon amino acid substitution models
contrast parsimony maximum likelihood-based reconstructions incorporate branch length differences calculating conditional probability each ancestral state given observed states at phylogeny tips
bayesian reconstruction methods enable further generalization conditional probability analysis removing necessity fix markov model parameters obtain ancestral states necessity specify fixed tree topology known branch lengths
bayesian inference integrates conclusions over all possible parameter values but achieve however requires prior probability distributions all aspects model
while probabilistic methods been previously presented bio phylogeographic context particular bayesian methods integrate over phylogenetic uncertainty markov model parameter uncertainty viral phylogeography studies rarely made use developments
may consequence low awareness existing software implementations arbitrary continuous-time markov chain models lack appreciation uncertainty intrinsic reconstructions ease one formally access epidemiological linkage through probabilistic approaches
recent phylogeographic study influenza h5n1 introduces heuristic non-parametric test evaluate whether parsimony-inferred migration events between two particular locations occur at significantly high frequency
null distributions frequencies arise randomizing tip localities after false discovery rate correction control simultaneous testing issues
although procedure addresses concerns about statistical inference sparse frequency matrices multiple comparison correction still results conservative estimate significant migration events
fully probabilistic approaches may further ease statistical inference yet similar tests remain lacking likelihood-based phylogeographic models
advances evolutionary inference methodology frequently demonstrated how novel approaches appended sequence analyses many cases starting alignment parameter estimation conditional tree reconstructions
example demographic inference involved genealogy reconstruction estimating time scale evolutionary history coalescent theory quantify demographic impact tree shape
well acknowledged sequential procedures ignore important sources uncertainty because they generally purge error associated each intermediate estimate
advent novel computational techniques like markov chain monte carlo sampling become feasible integrate many models involved simultaneously estimate parameters interest
demographic inference well-known example genealogy-based population genetics benefited advances
bayesian mcmc methods also enable ancestral state reconstruction while simultaneously accounting both phylogenetic mapping uncertainty
although adds much needed credibility ancestral reconstruction phylogeographic analysis would benefit even more fully integrating spatial temporal demographic inference
here implement ancestral reconstruction discrete states bayesian statistical framework evolutionary hypothesis testing geared towards rooted time-measured phylogenies
allows character mapping natural time scales calibrated under strict relaxed molecular clock combination several models population size change
use full probabilistic approach study viral phylogeography extend bayesian implementation mixture model exchange rates markov model allowed zero some probability
bayesian stochastic search variable selection enables us construct bayes factor test identifies most parsimonious description phylogeographic diffusion process
