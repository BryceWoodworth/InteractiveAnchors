use model determine proportion under indel-purifying selection between 2.56 percent 3.25 percent human euchromatin
since annotated protein-coding genes comprise only 1.2 percent euchromatin results lend further weight proposition more than half functional complement human genome non-protein-coding
method surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two three mammalian genomes
applying method human mouse dog genomes identify 90 mb human sequence under indel-purifying selection at predicted 10 percent false-discovery rate 75 percent sensitivity

 introduction 
human genome been shaped evolutionary forces mutation genetic drift selection latter acting main purify functional regions deleterious mutations
comparing human mouse genomes previously was estimated about 5 percent human genome undergone fewer point mutations than expected under neutral substitution model
accepting most likely caused effects purifying selection acting deleterious mutations observation implies at least 5 percent human genome biologically functional
since only known large class functional genomic elements protein-coding exons believed constitute only 1.2 percent our genome remains surprising result
begin understand biological role remaining non-genic functional elements essential first step their identification
recent studies focussed most highly conserved elements namely ultraconserved elements
elements exhibit surprisingly high level conservation rare even among protein-coding exons studies begun suggest intriguing roles elements alternative splicing development
however vast majority non-genic elements not perfectly conserved respect point mutations reliable identification elements within sea neutrally evolving dna proved difficult
deep conservation among diverse phyla reliable sign conserved biological function but less suitable identifying recently evolved sequence
comparative methods closely related species typically analyze substitution patterns flag conserved regions
methods well-developed they exploit phylogenetic information correlations along sequence achieve high sensitivities
although extremely powerful methods hard calibrate because incompletely understood variations neutral rates substitution due instance methylation levels chromatin state transcriptional activity chromosomal location conservative calibration leads reduction sensitivity
deep sequencing mammalian genomes considerably improves power comparative methods while expensive will eventually represent most satisfying solution sensitivity problem
all mutation processes point substitutions most prevalent insertions deletions approximately 10-fold less frequent
while nucleotide substitution models been studied intensively exception gene finding indels largely been treated evolutionary nuisance events accounted alignment procedures but otherwise uninformative
contrary view show indels highly informative evolutionary events
introduce model describing neutral distribution indels over genome show model fits large proportion human mouse alignment data remarkably well
then show deviations model main not caused variations neutral indel rates but consistent selection acting purify genome deleterious indels arise functional regions
first applied neutral indel model derive upper lower bounds proportion genome under purifying selection respect indels
our observations explained proposing between 78.8 0.6 mb 100.0 0.8 mb human genome been under indel-purifying selection since human mouse split
although still much higher than 1.2 percent represented coding exons represents substantially lower estimate than previous 5 percent estimate based substitution-level conservation but consistent more recent estimate
restricting ourselves ancestral repeats transposable elements inserted before human mouse split found near-exact fit between observations neutral model predictions
applying same method before predict among 1,263 mb tes only at most 1.2 mb been under sustained purifying selection
first time our knowledge model neutral evolution quantified proportion tes evolved neutrally
second application neutral indel model identified large proportion sequence elements evolved under indel-purifying selection
model allowed us calculate predicted false-discovery rate entire set well bayesian posterior probabilities individual elements under indel-purifying selection
correlating set various independent functional indicators both positive negative shown highly enriched functional dna
key strength proposed method lies its independence selection respect point mutations
consequently method provide independent confirmation selection thereby improving specificity methods based substitutions alone
moreover exciting possibility method allows identification sequence elements been under heterogeneous selection i.e been subject purifying selection respect indels but subject positive selection relaxed constraints respect substitutions
examples elements would include spacers between regulatory elements whose relative distance functionally constrained those shown exist drosophila
although functional nucleotide sequence spacers probably immaterial implying relaxed constraints respect substitutions
even more interesting class consists elements whose sequence under positive selection respect substitutions while at same time under purifying selection respect indels
since indels highly disruptive function protein-coding rna genes evident 10-fold reduced indel rates exons compared neutrally evolving dna conceivable elements exist
without exploiting evolutionary imprint indel-purifying selection difficult see how identify functional elements under positive selection respect substitutions absence comprehensive functional annotation only exists currently protein-coding genes
analysis percent sequence identity suggested much 5 percent dna under indel-purifying selection roughly 3 5 mb may under heterogeneous selection
among indel-conserved elements identified those exhibit more than expected number substitutions neutrally evolving dna still showed correlations functional indicators mentioned above thereby further confirming existence elements under heterogeneous selection
