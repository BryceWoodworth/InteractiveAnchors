 introduction 
many proteins protein regions been shown intrinsically disordered under native conditions; namely they contain no very little well-defined structure
intrinsically disordered proteins been found wide scope organisms their disorder content was shown increase organism complexity
comparative analysis functional roles disordered proteins suggest they predominantly located cell nucleus; involved transcription regulation cell signaling; also associated processes cell cycle control endocytosis replication biogenesis cytoskeleton 
idps certain properties functions distinguish them proteins well-defined structures
idps no unique three-dimensional structure isolated state but fold upon binding their interaction partners
conformational changes upon binding proteins unstructured regions much larger than those structured proteins
conformations disordered regions protein complex determined not only amino acid sequences but also interacting partners
idps many different functions bind many different partners using same different interfaces
idps accommodate larger interfaces smaller scaffolds compared proteins well-defined structure
idps typically amino acid composition low aromatic content high net charge well low sequence complexity high flexibility
intrinsic disorder provides rapid degradation unfolded proteins thereby enabling rapid response changes protein concentration
finally intrinsic disorder offers elegant mechanism regulation through post-translational modifications many cellular processes 
predictions disorder proteins take into account characteristic features unstructured proteins been shown rather successful especially case large regions
according results casp7 best prediction groups successfully identified 50 70 percent disordered residues false positive rates 3 percent 16 percent
prediction methods aim identify disordered regions through analysis amino acid sequences using mainly physico-chemical properties amino acids evolutionary conservation 
protein interactions crucial protein function biological role disordered proteins should also studied context
indeed folding disordered proteins into ordered structures may occur upon binding their specific partners may allow disordered regions structurally accommodate multiple interaction partners high specificity low affinity
moreover been shown binding mechanism whether binding occurs between folded unfolded chains depends structural characteristics interface properties degree minimal frustration monomers
binding through unfolded partially unfolded intermediates provide kinetic advantage through fly-casting mechanism
according mechanism dimensionality reduction occurs when folding disordered protein coupled binding thereby speeding up search specific targets
database continuous protein fragments been compiled protein data bank include short protein chains bound larger proteins
been argued morfs participate coupling binding folding hypothesis was supported analysis composition predicted disorder morf segments
result studying subtle structural differences same proteins different conditions functional states many so-called dual personality protein segments were found able exist both ordered disordered states
there continuous range between completely structured completely disordered proteins intermediate cases rather common : proteins disordered but compact multi-domain proteins disordered linkers ordered proteins some local disorder
examples proteins intrinsically disordered regions exhibit coupling between folding binding been described literature previously
nevertheless universality phenomenon functional importance many disordered regions remains unclear
question expanded further how much intrinsic disorder do protein complexes contain what its functional importance
answer questions examine observed predicted disorder protein complexes unbound proteins using large-scale dataset protein structures
atomic details structures conserved binding mode analysis introduced earlier allow us monitor changes happening near interaction interfaces infer their functional importance
