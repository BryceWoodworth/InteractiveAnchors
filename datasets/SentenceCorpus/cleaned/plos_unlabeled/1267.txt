 introduction 
neuronal circuits composed large variety branched structures axons dendrites forming highly entangled web reminiscent stochastic fractal
despite apparent chaos more than century ago ram n y cajal was able extract order neuroanatomical complexity formulating fundamental anatomical principles nerve cell organization
cajal described three biological laws neuronal architecture : optimization principles conservation space cytoplasm conduction time neural circuitry
principles helped him classify his observations allowed him postulate wide variety theories functionality directionality signal flow various brain areas
meantime many ideas been substantiated applying more rigorous statistical analysis: circuitry connectivity considerations well simple wire-packing constraints been shown determine statistics dendritic morphology
also been shown mathematically specific organization architecture many parts brain reflect selection pressure reduce wiring costs circuitry 
parallel development compartmental modelling techniques based theories wilfrid rall highlighted importance neuron's precise branching morphology its electrophysiological properties shown dendrites play important role computations performed inputs cell
fact requirements highly selective connectivity coherent topographic mapping sophisticated computation signal compartmentalization at level single cell network could all contribute observed intricacy brain wiring
two lines investigation raise question whether computation plays determining role shaping morphological appearance neuronal branching structures
alternatively simple laws material conduction time preservation ram n y cajal could more influence
using computational techniques become possible construct synthetic neuronal structures silico governed simulation physical biological constraints
two recent papers derived growth algorithm building dendritic arborisations following closely constraints previously described ram n y cajal
algorithm builds tree structures minimize total amount wiring path root all points tree corresponding material conduction time conservation respectively
synthetic insect dendrite morphologies were faithfully reproduced terms their visual appearance their branching parameters way
here explore algorithm's general applicability its potential describe any type dendritic branching
if algorithm sufficient accurately mimic essential structure neuronal circuitry resolve relative importance computation wiring constraints shaping neuronal morphology
then claim ram n y cajal's laws sufficient shaping neuronal morphology
specific computation will then only play subordinate role determining neuron's branching pattern
show here while cajal's laws do represent strict constraint neuronal branching neuronal morphology certain freedom operate within constraints
firstly adjusting balance between two wiring costs dendrite efficiently set its electrotonic compartmentalization quantity attributable computation
secondly density profile spanning field dendrite grows determines its shape dramatically
thirdly few weaker constraints suppression multifurcations addition spatial jitter sequential growth sub-regions dendrite helpful reproducing dendritic branching patterns particular preparations
additional constraints might shed light further functional computational developmental network determinants certain dendritic structures more will follow when applying our method many more preparations
moreover simple principles presented study used efficiently edit visualize analyze neuronal trees
finally approaches allow one generate highly realistic synthetic branched structures automatically reconstruct neuronal branching microscopy image stacks
